We’re going to be reflecting on the year, and LeBron is something that happened, so it will definitely be something that we’ll address in the show. But just like in sports, we don’t try to make that news happen. It unfolds.
You’re also being aware of public perception. For instance, you Instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer, right, and you so like you definitely have, I don’t know how to put it, maybe a love triangle thing going on with Skylar and she’ll probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where you’ll mention it like you did with SNL when you did the whole dated Rihanna thing? Everyone loved it, so can we expect that now that you’ll be hosting the ESPYS?
Drake:
Shell:
We’ve been working hard, like I said, on the pre‑tapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night, which I can 100% guarantee it will.
Shell:
Drake:
Drake:
Drake:

Drake:
You have so many relationships with a lot of athletes. Is there anyone in particular that you haven’t met yet that you’re looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that you’re with already given you any advice about hosting?

But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on

Look at fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Forget, wait till it's right, now it's wait till it's more
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour
But once they have my pants and my khakis
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined to change
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
You special girl, don't leave me baby
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me through some various shit
It's something that I can rarely predict

So, at least I know where the ones at

And until you do babe (don't you leave)
But before you do (don't you leave)
But you don't, yeah, you don't want to start on me
Make sure, make sure (I need you to cum)
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I don't trust a word you say
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
They look up to me
I caught that whole play
Since, things never been the same
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
And more chune for your headtop
We was just walking
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I think that I'm in love
Got me hypnotized with your magic spell
Look, previously mischievous behavior
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But ugh, Keshia, Keshia do you remember the old us?
Tellin' you these stories bout lonely women that I ignore
I am talking lofts and beach condo adult shit
Thats why I love you
Can I, can I save you from you
And that champagne you been sipping
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do (yeah)
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all (*4X*)
I bet there's a reason for it all
Telling me how you moving away and startin over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just sayin' shit
Oh, wait, no I get it
And I heard there’s nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
That’s why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
You just do it for yourself, you're the fucking coldest
Long as they got a little class like half days
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
They get a baller, figure they ain't got to pick a career
Like “Voilà!” You do it right he just might buy you a car
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarre
Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Showtime)
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
They used to be the ones to watch Ricki Lake show
One too many starting over speeches
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
Feel like I been here before, huh?
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spendin' hours in salons on your hairstyle
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
I love the way you put it together
She got her own paper
On a shopping spreee
My girl is fancy, fly and free
You can never report a fancy girl like me
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
Nails done hair done, nails done hair done
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And we can do the things we never got the time to
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
They want the hits, I play the game
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
But I probably will when Hov does
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
I guess that mean they come few and far between
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
You got something that belongs to me
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Maybe we just should have did things my way
And that just didn't sit right with you
I wanna take you to oasises
Ayy, freaky like the red leather Michael
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
I always get your ass over here somehow
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
You got options, but I been chosen
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Slashin' like Guns N' Roses
The way you like it, yeah
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
It's more than just a mission (Hey, hey, hey)
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
But give all I have to you and
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
Yeah, turn everything up
Yeah, oh yeah
Turn everything up a little more
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
Can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
Just hitting my line
Too hot to handle
I'm new to all of this
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate to you
They throwin' dirt on my old name
Keep you in the front, never in the back and never on the side, uh
You a real ass woman and I like it
Talk about you like you never leave his side
Let's just keep it private (Don't say anything)
Dedicate to you
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
I mean, you say that like it's easy
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my voice
My niggas really made somethin' from nothin'
Make sure the staff are paid well
No one knows when the plan is hatchin'
Tiptoe, niggas better know
Yeah, well it's real late over here
But if y'all goin' to war I'm there for sure
Wouldn't miss it
Key West retirement plan
October Firm the new chain of command
I took a lot of my brothers from B and E licks or the pot rotation
To ridin' shotgun in a Picasso painting
Tricks up sleeves, have 'em playin' innocent to get the shits I need
Loyalty is priceless to me and this I see
Before I ever seen this shit tatted on P and tatted on C and tatted on me
I speak truth and get to shatterin' dreams
So it's best to tiptoe, niggas better know, yeah
Saucy! You just stepped out of the club straight into the booth like it's light. Tear up the ting in one take!
My brother, you already know
Nah for real. I stepped in here, SN1, OVO, Fire in the Booth, Charlie Sloth. Come on. The official. I rock with the official. I'm on official ting, you know what it is man. Come on, come on
Nah, you know what it is, of course
Nah, I don't wanna hear no chat for the whole 18 about Charlie Sloth. Are you dumb? Alright. Jheeze, jheeze
And that right there: one take. A real moment right there
And that's Fire in the Booth my guy!
When I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit
I just wish they'd let you try it first
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Taking off like—Oh
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
That felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though
It's been years though, I just learn to deal with it
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's saying she's more lonely than ever before
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
And I think that I just realized what it means
Every night it's fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I sware I ain't lyon, like this is my cubs
Weezy F Baby, and I lookin like I does some shit
That mean they 24s, boy, what you on
I'm richer than a bitch without the gray coupon
Cause every single record I am so unkind
Nigga, this that crack and you know rugs cost
Never LIE, I got everything I tell them I got
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
Put on my OJ gloves, I'm gonna kill this shit
Make a plumber throgh his plundger, I can't deal with this shit
The flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch, I'm back on my shit, like a fly
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
1da sent this in, I'm goin' up all the way
I guess luck is on your side
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— (True)
I can't be around the niggas you minglin' with
I guess luck is on your side
You mad
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
It may not mean nothing to y'all
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button (what?) nothin' man
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
So I don't plan on stopping at all
And telling every girl she the one for me
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur "to the top"
But what should I scream for? This is my theme park
Shhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
Nuts they go, Macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos, he's wondering if he should spit this slow
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Pay back mothafucka for the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place
But understand nothing was done for me
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
And is it today that you will find your new release?
But we all so spoiled now
All that yappin' on the phone shit
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Old number, so it bounce back
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Please, one at a time
When he told me pay it no mind
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
I'm the troublemaker in the neighborhood
Yeah, we outchea
Ya dun know, eh?
It's a OVO ting, eh?
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
I fondle the money, fornicate with a fortune
MBA accountants, amounts, they get unholy
When them wheels land, Travis Barker, drums playing
Tap-dance to my drum roll (Uh)
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
This is my town, if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
I could Western Union some money, get your passport and then come
Yeah, I do this shit to the death, yeah, I do this shit til I'm gone
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Where you tryna go, I'm ready
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm standing on these couches sayin'
And why I would pretend
I got friends with money, and I got money too
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
And then we do that!
Somehwere on the island
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
He couldn't have done it like this sho' nuff
'Cause we can do it!
I got friends with money, and I got money too
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm gettin' money)
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I know you been through more than most of us
Been a East Side ting
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
You give but you cannot take love
I wish you could see
That's why you trust me
Coulda changed your life
Girl, I coulda changed your life
Where we were never taught to love
Where the money makes a difference
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
In the mirror while I'm puttin' all this ice on
All I really want is
Ooh I wanna see ya
(Yeah man, ATF Street Love)
When I decided
I need someone to hold me
I need someone that needs me
So we can get together
(Yeah, yeah)
You know, we don't have to be dramatic
When you're out of town
You need me to get that shit together
So we can get together
You need me to
Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer. And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes
Money is everythang, and its every other thing
Cash is the right now, women are the post game
It's comin too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin john B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
This supplement im on got me feeling mighty
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money.. bitch...
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
God made himself a way from me to you
Tay you know, you know I told you many times you my favorite rapper right?
Uhh
Look I stands out
So don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
And all you women that I fucked get over it
My whole team getting rich get over it
Pooh, 'Te

Say my name, say my name
And this ain't no time for uncertainty
You know how this shit goes
Time escapes me

Neither of us wanna play the side no more
When no one is around you
Say my name
Back again return of the mack again
Little me
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
Hear me, Trey's girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint

And when I give ya what I give ya
When I give ya what I give ya
(It's The Prince, look here)
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor

Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)

Your boy all glowed up
Every time we touch down, bet it go up
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Hope I deal with karma 'fore my son do
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing I'm part of
You need devotion
Through devotion
Clap your hands this evening

"I only love my bed and my momma I'm sorry"
Yeah, they wishin'
I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track admitting most of my Currency’s imported
Repeat offender, Anita Baker
Playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender
My foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in
When pops turned over the keys like a new ignition
Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Aside from talkin bout the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife
I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
But you the one I blame in this case
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
'Cause you'd be tired of taking care of me by now
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
But the good ones go
It's fuckin' losers like you that make me do what I do
You ain't nothin' to shoot, you don't even exist
Or write more lies about they drugs, guns or homicide
My niggas, we ride or die
Hatin' when it come to D, I can take you're starting 5
It makes my heart hurt when dumb niggas act hood
If this little nigga survive then it gotta be God
Every time I see y'all retard niggas y'all bitch out
Talkin' all that bang bang shit, pull a clip out
Sayin' you a blood, next week you prolly crip out
Do shit on my own, I never asked for help
Little niggas get little recognition you little bitch
Hey yo Aristo, I'm lost, can you tell me whats goin' on in the streets?
And yes I asked for a 16, you did your 16
But fuck the money and the cars that I drive to set
You act like you hood and hood niggas'll harm ya
You one of the seven dwarfs standing next to me
You probably snitchin' in court, then accept the plea
And I hear you paying these women and I sex for free (what up sweetheart)
But dog, how did this start, how we get to this part?
They say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school (I did)
Tell them not to call and that's even if they require you
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
I just came off making two million in 30 days
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Get over it, get over it
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
Yeah, yeah
Jheeze, yeah
Right, look, look
Tell me how you really feel
Couldn't make a greatest hits
But you still ain't this
Heard you never claimed the hood
Oh well, ship sailed
That they try to hit me with boat fines
Like I'm shirt off shorty
Whole city goin' crazy
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This ain't no met-along-the-way shit
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I wear the chain like a bowtie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
In the state of euphoria feelin' so sedated
Forest Hill estated, all dinners catered
And I am, everywhere where that you wish you could be
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
Stay at the top like I'm stuck
That's just how I'm givin' it up
But I can't take a knee, 'cause I'm wearin' all white
They want me gone, out of the picture
I'm so hot, yeah, I’m so right now
Keep hearin' clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone
I got a new mansion, 'cause I outgrew the condo
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
And when you’re fuckin' someone else
I’ll end up stoppin', won’t I? And by the time I end up stoppin'
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
You say that you over me, you always end up under me
She tells me, "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now
She is here and we're so gone
I might be too strung out on compliments
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it (Ayy)
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
Now it's something they know
I be yellin' out, "Money over everything! Money on my mind!"
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
I'm like, "Why I gotta be all that?"
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'
You know that they ain't even got it like that
They know, they know, they know
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
They know, they know, they know
We brought along the homie DJ Rockstar to make this a big motherfuckin event
All the niggas we don't need anymore
Talkin' 'bout how the weather's changin'
She asked me
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
I'm not used to settlin' down
And I say "Well, goddamn"
I ain't even got a strap if you think we really need one, I'm on it
All of this, it's alcohol, it's drugs, weed, it's everything that you could ever imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to take a step up. Young girls are hot, and they will fuck anybody, anytime, anyway. Because they are so hot and young guys are, they are going for it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need to uh, uh, uh, uh educate themselves. Women are too fucking hot.  
Haaa
You left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
It's hard to do these things alone
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
You act so different around me
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
I think there's something, baby
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
And if your man get to stuntin’
Bet you hear my name every single place that you go
Tell me what it do
I belong to the youngest Grammy nominated crew
Club owners give me reasons to appear at night
I will kill the game and never send it my condolence
Taught to never love a chick and only love the moments
Y'all lemon small, y'all never ball
Yeah, 40 hears my interviews, tone it down
Oh wait, hold up, Young F’n Weezy
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
Get it?
Picture me not strive
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
They need a second plate a this knowledge
With some fresh nice ones on my feet
Baby it's about the game
Baby it's about the game
You used to call me on my
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
That can only mean one thing
You make me feel like I did you wrong
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
You don't need nobody else, no
Late night when you need my love
That can only mean one thing
You know exactly what you got
And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
Throw your ones up in the air
''Cause the ones you throw will get her out of
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And she dance to the song
One hotel room that all y'all sleep in
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Throw your ones up in the air
'Cause the ones you throw will get her out of
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
That's the shit I'm talking 'bout though, like you changed up, you don't even fuckin' link nobody no more, you just dash me away like a cyattie. Yo, you cheesed me dog
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
I drove in the snow for you? Yeah
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Or I was average like that
But how 'bout now? (Now)
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh-yeah, oh-yeah
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
Okay now we got some action
They gotta die out eventually
Swear I just had an epiphany
I had to count it and count it again
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
I do my own propaganda
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
Views already a classic
I feed my family with this
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They gotta go, they gotta go
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
I don't know what else is left for me
I don't let it get to me
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
But off verses, he been blackin'
They wan' be on TV right next to me
I hate a rapper especially
Don't get along man, we tried it
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Done
Pourin' champagne off commercial fame
You ain't worth a thing, you ain't gang gang
It's my world, it's Wayne's world
Orange bottle full of tablets
Okay now we got some habits
Cause I pull up, I stop and pop
So you know I don't have the energy
Done
Yeah
Nigga, what you thought?
Icy like 1017
A little less talk and a little more action
I need you out in Jamaica, relaxin'
Thought I had everything, somehow
I wan' beat it up with somethin', somethin'
You're a diamond out the rough or somethin', somethin'
You need to fuckin' stop watchin' me
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Jeffery)
Icy like there's nobody you'd ever need (icy, icy)
Better not give that up (better not give that up)
Thought I had everything somehow
You need to give luck to someone
You need to fuckin' stop watchin' me
Oh
I could never be ashamed of you
You've told me things
Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Yours were the truest eyes I'd ever seen
Could you ever
Just got back overseas, I was the main attraction
I mean there's not even a doubt, you know what I'm about
So make me one, I know that you can make me one
I'm too legit
I'm just trying to get her in the mood
Because before she pop the pussy she need me to pop the question
Knockin' at your door
Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like, "Fuck these niggas," rather keep it to yourself
And these haters pretending that it's all good
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie (Drake)
Violence, you don't wanna resort
You can't resist bein' rich when you record
If your life is a movie, you a extra
I'm so fly, I glide: Clyde Drexler (wooh)
But I wanna hit you back to say
Don't tell anybody what we do
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Don't tell anybody what we do
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Take me to another place where I'll be
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
But I ain't the dealer
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
Yeah, Drizzy Drake what the lick read?
We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried
Yeah
Yeah
It's Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit and urine
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
It goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And I'ma be a legend even when my life end
And I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Think about the last time I came through
I had something more than a gift for you
Bout to get my bags and all I needs an address
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I run this game, just play your role
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Yeah I hear you talkin, don't know who you tryin to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya
Uhh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
I know you get impatient as the time pass
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
I-I-I-I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
Baby come closer, baby come closer
(Background voice)
So keep thinkin' you the man

Pointed right at you "BANG!", the baddest women ever in the heart of south
Proven over and over again thats why im hard to doubt, plus im
Young money 'till the death, I took the carter route
I'm still fly, I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
Coldest thing dropping, and these bitches wanna snow blo
Listen and respect, the city almost won back
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewing me
Plus he tought me how to spot an officer in plane clothes
The names I mention are crooshel, you gonna need us
I am so sure of my rhymes, I could sacrafise a line
I sware, I really fuckin does it
I had these niggas trippin, no luggage
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand me
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand me
So offended that I had to double check
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
So offended that I had to double check
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know (That I know)
And when you get to shoppin', you spend it like you earned it
I thought you were the one from the jump that confirmed it
I know you special, girl, 'cause I know too many
'Cause I want ya, and I need ya
I need that black card and the code to the safe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, guess who's back
Now let me see you
Bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back!
B-bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back!
Clap that ass, you're the only one I love
Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is all finished
It is a shame that a couple of ‘em are off limits
You know the ones we saw before we came in it
I know he ain't trippin’
The ones that you fuck and the ones that you wife up
Don’t let them fuck your life up
Just got a couple Warhol’s for my hallways
Ayy, yeah
When I pop shit, don’t ever let up, yeah
I can not give you a pass to just play with my money and family and friends
Your foreign is used, I looked up the VIN

You heard that in the VMAs, you heard that wherever he goes
Ya know what I mean?
And I bet neither are you if you listening
But look, you need to just let this play out
Which one of y'all, which, which one
Which one of y'all goin' home with Trigga?
Reach for that hand shake, got a hug

You leaned over and said you want me
Off to the crib, shawty, where we gonna end up
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex

(Get you to the crib)
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex
If you ever come up with a question, you should ask it
(Upstairs to the bed)
You gonna think I invented sex
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand em
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
I guess its when my albums selling in the stores
He a star now look up you'll probably see him
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
S550 navigatin' where I gonna be
P.A.G. mother fucker don't forget the E
I'm the man in my city they demand at me
Only lyin' I do is lyin' out in the tropics
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
Is there more? Yeah
I'll let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
There's still nothin' they could really do
What you got, time on your hands or time on your side?
Am I missin' somethin' that's more important to find?
Like healin' my soul, like family time
My heartbeat's racing (My heartbeat's racing)
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
Already got what you needed, I guess
Quickly (Quickly) learned yourself through me (Through me)

Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (Jaded)
I wanna be around while you chasin'
You got somethin' real, not basic
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me
That was before me, I musta changed it
Most of these things I don't wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
(Back around, back around, dangerous, oh, ooh yeah)
Dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
26 on my third GQ cover
Swear you niggas is hopeless
But that’s… that’s where all this... that’s where the feeling is
The music that you and I used to listen to ahh.. was just..
I Comedy Central roast niggas and turn 'em to ghost niggas
That five star in your city, they know where we at
Heard a couple niggas hatin' but them fuck niggas weak
Fuck your list you lame niggas and doubters
Who gives a poker face when you jokers showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, takin' on the giants
Or that '96 Jay, or that Chronic shit, Dre
To these too cool for school niggas I'm Columbine
'Cause either fuckin' way, man all them niggas is less than me
When you see them fall down
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
Flippin' the script like a read-through
They'll know, they'll know
I can understand
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
Chillin' even if I'm in a goose down coat
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Got everything, I got everything
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Money on my mind, you should think the same
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested(Tru)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
But that was years later on some crazy shit
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
I was made for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...
Sometimes it be like that
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
And that ship won’t sail
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
She said you're my everything
Hate that I treat it like it's a whatever thing
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Put a bib on me
It was, uh... it was alright. Shit's just crazy man. The whole energy out here is just changing, you know, it's just getting dark man, quick. It's like mans are on the road it feels like as if anybody is a target, you know, you just don't know where it's gonna come from, can't even gauge it man. It's like I go from that, trying to balance that to just balance my own sanity, drinking more, smoking more, you know staying up so late that it's early, like fuck. I'm not losing it though, you know, I'm just venting, I'm not like worried, it's already too late for these guys trust me, I'm just more worried about myself you know, I just gotta come home.
JUNGLE
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
So if you gotta go
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
Damn, of all the places you could go
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Ever since you met me
I always saw you for what you could've been
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
So come and skate with me
So let's kick
And push
And coast
People barely remember me from back in the day
I tell her I was there on vacation
Feeling like the Pope's here, homie, this is recess
Yes, I'm literally Larnell Lewis with a
Kick, push Kick, push Coast
Just a rebel, lookin' for a place to go
So I kick Then push
Yeah, yeah
Until the cops came and said "There's no skating here"
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So let's kick, uh, uh
And coast
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
Yeah from the beginning to the end
(Ness on the beat)
I gave my bro an advance (Yeah)
Love is just not in my plans
Not even takin' a chance
Shoutout to T, he did three
I'm in the penthouse but still, nothin' is sweet (yeah)
I heard your new shit and I'm kissin' my teeth
Yeah, ahh!
I've got bitches in the merky, swervin', lookin' all curvy
And you already know I love them breasts, lookin' all perky
Lookin' all Christmas gift-wrapped, lookin' all turkey
Whippin' that white girl (Yeah?), cookin' that Cersei (Dah!)
Now this is that big bad, this is Gustavo (Mmm!)
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
This been where you find me at
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Yeah, and you know how that should go
You know how that should go
That's the truth, OVO Unruly
Yeah
I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
You don't know where you're gonna go
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong
When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
I'm the one
This another one from your boy V-O
I'm gon tell the people, that we locking this down
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!
Girl, I've been thinking about the way, that you love me every day
And I want to know, if You Feel The Same Way!!
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
UH, UH, UH (UH, V-O)
I can easily make them admit that the bounce back
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine
I don't deserve, All this Love (loving me)!!
This is real and I'm concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends, and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step.
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
Talking money with me is really unfair
I am nothing like these other niggas coming out this year"
Even if you never met me you can tell I’m on the same shit
Ask your favorite rapper homie guarantee that he know
They can do what I allow
I'm in, low cut Louis with them hard denim jeans an a beige jacket
Hands down the best in my age bracket
Spending every moment in the studio
Took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
So, baby, I'ma lock my door and disconnect my phone
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
Me and my nigga Drake
I got the gift like Santa Claus
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Same dudes used to laugh at me
With no copies made I got the master keys
Me and success are two things you don't wanna find your ass between
*Back against the wall like a plasma screens*
I should leave Earth, nothing left to do here
Everyday is Christmas and e'ry night is New Year's
Say whatever, I never been concerned about who hears
I'm telling you dog, always got the spring collection in fall
But once you slept with one dime man, you slept with them all, uhh
Family, money, and music is all I ever knew
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue
Stop acting like teen girls are my only market
Cause these are only the joints that I'm giving away
The type of life you first timers could soak in
Where those are dark oak floors and that expensive cookwear
Thats a 07 but I got a even newer ride
Wikepidia known
Obtain a key to your home
Cause you just stupid dog
The A8 super large
Only thing Im paying is attention to the detail
You was having hoop dreams
Young money old accounts
She be jumping up and down
Trynna fit that ass in
Cause her spirit is free
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree
There’s no copies of the key
Kinda hard to concentrate when cameras are flashin’
Don’t know where she’s going
There's too many in the world
But I swear that ones my girl
Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.
What's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.
She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016: Rihanna.
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa—very important and very pretentious
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
You still ain't did shit about the other one
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Lyrics to Drake's song "Bad Breed" will be available when Views From The 6 is released on April 29th. Please continue to check Rap Genius for further updates!
We don't even go out no more
Always complainin
I guess you don't watch the news
Aside from the fact
You can die where you from, or die where you at
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
Lend me ya kleenex
Hope that I see you, see you
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
I am making stock works, while you working stock rooms
You fake gangsta rappers a cliché
I'll be all in your face like, "No speak-a la ingles"
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flix
I tell them myself who I am feeling probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
Spittin' a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
Forget it girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Well I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga keep your two cents I ain't tryna leave you broke
You can't love, but I bet ya
Yo can't hine yeah
The 1st time around
And I put the diamonds down
They not sure it'll work but their all hoping
With four walls
Important and vital
I try to explain
And still they claim king
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not
I'll never go broke
Fuck em I'm flashin' the pan
Look... I got few days left
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Holla!
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Stay in big six-six with woes
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Think you know me? That's not true
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I got so much tings in the stash
Yeah, Link Up TV, Behind Barz
Mm-hmm, yeah, look
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
We came around and you showed us the most
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
Just like that one time at Nobu
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
Yeah, Link Up TV
Man I wish ya'll would
I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat
And these rappers in a panic
But you can tell by my strut
I'm tryna tell you I do this
The house look something like a resort
You can't resist being rich when you record
All these shoulda coulda wouldas
But it never made us different, oh
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?"
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
You know who you are
I got you
Drop down, drop-drop (Shit is real out here)
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it
The spark ain't enough for you
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear that I get it, I get it, I get it
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Your hustle don't ever go unnoticed baby, I'm with you I'm with it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Got a link on the champagne, your best friend is bar-tending
Your parents saying this another phase in your life
I get it I get it, I'm working too hard let's get into some fun shit
Your girl got a DUI, I'll make the calls to get y'all through customs
Tell your best friend, "Girl get your paperwork right"
We so far from finished, I brought you right back just so we can relive it
Your momma used to live at the church on Sunday
We're not in Kansas anymore
Okay I just got back from another label meeting and
And you herd all of my songs so you know this shit wrong
You, you, you, you, you
And just to get a visual them niggas gotta squint
There I ammmm
You, you, you, you
I go by the name of Drake
I got my man Slakah The Beatchild here
My man Hazel
You know how I get down
Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama (Damn)
You're the only one
And then expect favors (Yea)
You couldn't pay me!
But this bitch is crazy (Hahaha)
But this bitch is crazy
And you know like I was sayin sometimes
I gotta get my R&B on you know
I can tear it easy and all that
Yea
Unruly, unruly, maddas
Who keeps bringing more? I’ve had too many
I’m blem for real, I might just say how I feel
I need you to stop runnin' back to your ex, he's a wasteman
I'm blem for real, I might just say how I feel
You move with me, I’ll go crazy
I wanna know, how come we can never slash and stay friends?
I’m blem for real, I might just say how I feel
And get you gold, no spray tans
Who keeps bring dubs I've heard too many
I had her on ice but then
Look who I'm fuckin' again
Jeez
I watched the ice get so thin
Now, does she sink or does she swim, now?
'Cause I'm nice to your friends
My window got blue in the tint (Skrrt)
(Blue faces)
I know you know it's in my nature to get distant
Unfortunate, I think you know there's something missing
But you never say shit
Don't know how to take it (Take it, yeah)
Buzzing your body
Body to body
You said you're over me
You said you're over me
Why are we in Chanel talkin' 'bout life and shit?
Buzzin' your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
I know, you know, it’s in my nature to get distant
Unfortunate, I think you know there's somethin' missin'
Buzzin' in your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
I'm tryin' to tell you something that you prolly should know
And ahh, my real friends never hearing from me
That's why I pick and choose
We walk the same paths, but got on different shoes
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
I'm what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. Mary's
But I ain't playin' high school games
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Or is everything I'm doing too late?
New, new, new (Brand new), oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Never thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google
They've been droppin' out on both sides
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Wide eyed and uneducated at 19
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
Guess it is what we make it
The season start and I don't wanna
Now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
What happened to the things
(Drake)
Feels Like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new
(Drake verse 2)
This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
How long will this last
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(aye,aye,aye)
Remix baby if he can do good then I can do better
Is anything I'm doing brand new(6x)
Did you spend the night in his bed
Ooh ohh yeah yeah yeah
And how I wanna touch, I'm so far away (I'm so)
Don't go missing, fly with me
Promise that I won't forget
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me, fly
I'm just another nigga tryna keep his money up
I'll wipe that smirk off your face, you think it's funny, huh?
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me ('Cause you are)
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the ambiance all
I tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, Capitalize That
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
We talk casually about the industry
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Can I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, baby?
Can I get an honest answer from you right now, baby?
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
You do so much more than that for me
'Cause that's the side you never get to see
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I? Can I, baby?
Set me up, and let me off
I'm a cannonball
And I hope when dinners cold, my fingers do not dessert me
And I'm the result of when it all goes right
So many pictures, man, the floor is a collage
I'm a cannonball
It's The Boy but I'm still the man, come and get your mans
I don't know, first you caught the hands, then you took the stand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We with everything, I went off in the '16, give me '17
Man, my record deal should be 500 million, goddamn
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates
Damn, ol' triple double, Russ face, watch with the bust face
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face
All that shit embarrassin'
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again
All that's in my account at the Bank of America
I feel like im, im making a return
Or even in a victor bag, so if you quick to brag then u get clipped to tag
Stop snitching if your man seen a killer, you never ever seen it, it can't seem familiar
Uh, yea, and its down south for the summer ima leave them at home
Uh, everybody that mess with me I see you
Uh, niko I see ya uh
Yea richie sosa I see ya uh
Heartfelt music
Its my year its my summer my decade
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
You could hit it with a stone
And they gotta relocate
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Yeah, yeah
They be watchin' what they say
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call, 22
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
You build it up to break it halfway through
But you never change up
Won't even give me a chance
Up all night
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I'm charged up
We goin' live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin' people with they arms up
(Stop, stop, stop, stop…)
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long
Industry people… regular people…
You know what it is, whenever I visit
Me, I go through underground garages
What numbers do I still have?
'Member when you let me in between?
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Maybe I'll love you one day
On this one way
Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Lot of people tryna take us viral
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
You go in first with your girls
Women they come they go
Monday, Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
You know what it is, whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Breaking news, my niggas
Best believe, she's fucking some niggas on that team
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
Then you find it, awkward silence
All because of her I don't do you like I should
I knew a couple of your friends way before
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
I’m just a writer flaming pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams get At ‘em when I ignite her
Yup, soon as a couple plan a trip, you smell gasoline I’m burning All up and down the strip, strip
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
This ain't last year, money like a cashier
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
I get a dessert plate
You better bank on me
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Closer to my dreams I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
Charcoal Charger
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
And "Hi, haters
Summertime
Wintertime
Anytime
I can probably tell you a lil somethin' now
He stay grown
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
First place is often the worst place
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
It's better bein' this real
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Spring 07
I'm drawin' and drawin' till the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Closer to my dreams
They tryna be the best
The gray ten drop out
Racin' through back streets
I'm gettin' higher
Whoa
Closer to my dreams
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
Uh, but believe I remember it all
I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say "What up, though?"
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home
Uh, but believe I remember it all
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
And whose Continental GT is outside
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
And I am, present when it matters most
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
You don't need it
Not in the least bit
This whole fuckin' game thankless
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I been had it since "No Scrubs" and "No Pigeons"
DiCaprio level the way they play that
They even hit my line like, "Where you been at?"
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this

It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy
See that was a segue, I believe the matter
And if you planning family vacations you better know when
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime
Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing
(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive
To name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny. No, in that case, you robbed everybody. We all need text messages!
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me, someone to fuck me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face

And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know
But I ain't with the hard talk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
I hug and kiss the drum kick
Right, uh
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
"There’s 3 balls and a strike. Here's the pitch. It's belted deep to center, Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!"
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
Talk about pussy power
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power
Same city, same friends if you're looking
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin'
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there
I treat you good, girl, like you're famous
You just buzzed the front gate

Loving the crew, oh

(If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city)
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga

Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas

Bad press during the summer over allegations

Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy
You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
You know you got...
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy
I'm a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
See my role models roll with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough than the whole lotto
Let the mind work ya know
I'd like to ummm
I'd like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
So I guess that makes you Aunt Viv
Kinda direct yo
So I was just tryna upgrade you
Get to know the people that surround you
And I fit every stereotype that y'all believe in
You need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin' it

She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Gassed off journalistic
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
All factual, I call the house "the embassy"
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel
I broke spirits that I never meant to
I refuse to comply with regulations
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Check the guest list
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira
I love, I love it
T. Slack, I promise I got 'em, homie!
I'mma be out for a minute, I'll bring the heat back
These chicks with ass fully skip they class
But, I'm not stupid, nah -- I'm tight fisted
Let him breathe, let him live
Gotta love that
Had me doing repaints, just to get em re-scratched
But, that's just the drama that the fame brings
Fresh prince tryna touch sky like
It's Mr. big dreams, no more than 2 months commitment
He a G, he just doin his thing
Gotta love that
That's the wrong thing to do
That's the wrong thing to do
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
I need someone different
We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
You know it, oh ho, you know it
(Oh ho, oh ho)
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
So it’s on
Watch me do it
I’mma do it all
I’m with my people
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Baby forget about it
My judgment's never cloudy
Baby after you
I’ve had a glass or two so somebody remind me where I am
Millionaire, multi
I’m the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
Because everything's easier to get into than get out off
Uh, well alright
Uh huh, yeah
Yeah, and he was just practice
Yeah, and I got it together
I know that shit is exhausting girl
And your mistakes are costing girl
Silence keeps cloudin' me
And I, I wish time never mattered
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
There's real ones around me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Yeah
You's a vegan but you goin' ham
You know what's different, baby
Let me know when you're downtown
I heard you got too much on your shoulders
Heard a lot of things, don't joke with me
Blue yellow bandana, oh, trip planner
She knows that it's not something to run from now, oh
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy (Watch that)
The concept of puttin' money first, boy (First)
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy (Work)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
Rolling swishers, hittin' swishes
She'll admit it, she'll admit it (Try a ting)
And just like every single other thing in my life
Already had a Rolls Royce (On the road)
I give a fuck about his squad, boy (Man, that thing old)
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
Bitch, I know you heard things
I can't believe it
While your man standing right beside ya?
But you know and I know, that nobody gon do ya like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line of sight
Consequences keep weighin me down
I can't believe it
I ain't never really see a future in us
My feelings never did go past, some late night smash
I can't believe it
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
I don't understand why God sent me to you
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
A lot of records from here, they get no play
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
Like a single with only backgrounds
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Asked me to kick some new school lines
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
While we get this paper, and that's how we do
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
I'm so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card

You know I had to do it for ya

And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say, "Okay, if you say so"
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
And then you never notice they missin'
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
Five years later, how am I the man still?
Aww man, aww man, aww man

Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
On four-four's (Who?) Four-four's at the 4-0 (Wait) for O
"He's a crook, George. He throws those parties the papers are always talking about."
Colin Powell, general admission
"By any means," AK lookin' out the window screen
Who wanna become my 100th problem?
That cheese made us constipated couldn't tell us shit
"It's called greed, old sport."
"Oh... saw the opportunity, I suppose."
To fuck with Young H-O (heheheh)
30's the new 20 nigga I'm so hot still (uhh)
I did all that by the age of 21
I got the right stock
I know you're like "Fuck! This is child abuse, call DYFS!"
30's the new 20 nigga, I'm on fire still
Don't let the patent leather shoes fool you youngin'
I don't got one gun on me
When we get the call he's, no longer with us, fire ya babysitters
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Five deep in a hooptie like that (like that)
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Y'all youngins chase, I'm Patronin' it straight
Y'all drink Dom but not Rosé (hey)
Ya chick shop at the mall
Comin' back with Birkin bags
I go to parties to party with nice girls
Baby boy, now I'm all grown up
Ya, we used to ball like that (like that)
Me and my conglomerate
Let me, live out my dreams until my heart give out
Involved with cream, you know exactly what this is about
Straight to the league, I ain't waitin' for my knee to blow
Yesterday I was needin' this dough
Long as your math is fast, if your readin' is slow
Then told me that the Mo' did it
And won't miss it, so don't twist it
D-P 3, YES!
Now I'm just scratchin' the surface
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
"Gimme a second, I swear," I would say about my rap career
'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
And this was the stress I lived with
And it's nobody's fault, I made the decisions I made
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
EPILOGUE
Oprah and I have since gone on to become friendly acquaintances, after having only observed each other warily from a distance. But it was a fascinating moment to me. Rap, as I said at the beginning of the book, is at heart an art form that gave voice to a specific experience, but, like every art, is ultimately about the most common human experiences: joy, pain, fear, desire, uncertainty, hope, anger, love--love of crew, love of family, even romantic love (put on "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" some time and tell me rap can't be romantic--or if you want to keep it street, put on Mary J. Blige and Method Man's "I'll be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By"). Of course, in the end, it may not be the art form for you. Oprah, for instance, still can't get past the n-word issue (or the nigga issue, with all apologies to Ms. Winfrey). I can respect her position. To her, it's a matter of acknowledging the deep and painful history of the word. To me, it's just a word, a word whose power is owned by the user and his or her intention. People give words power, so banning a word is futile, really. "Nigga" becomes "porch monkey" becomes "coon" and so on if that's what's in a person's heart. The key is to change the person. And we change people through conversation, not through censorship. That's why I want people to understand what the words we use - and the stories we tell - are really about.
But great MCing is not just about filling in the meter of the song with rhythm and melody. The other ways that poets make words work is by giving them layers of meaning, so you can use them to get at complicated truths in a way that straightforward storytelling fails to do. The word you use can be read a dozen different ways: They can be funny and serious. They can be symbolic and literal. They can be nakedly obvious and subliminally effective at the same time. The art of rap is deceptive. It seems so straightforward and personal and real that people read it completely literally, as raw testimony, or autobiography. And sometimes the words we use, nigga, bitch, motherfucker, and the violence of the images overwhelms some listeners, It’s all white noise to them until they hear a bitch or a nigga and then they run off yelling “See!” and feel vindicated in their narrow conception of what the music is about. But that would be like listening to Maya Angelou and ignoring everything until you hear her drop a line about drinking or sleeping with someone’s husband and then dismissing her as an alcoholic adulterer
In places like Marcy there are people who know the ins and outs of government bureaucracies, police procedures, and sentencing guidelines, who spend half of their lives in dirty waiting rooms on plastic chairs waiting for someone to call their name. But for all of this involvement, the government might as well be the weather because a lot of us don’t think we have anything to do with it--we don't believe we have any control over this thing that controls us. A lot of our heroes, almost by default, were people who tried to dismantle or overthrow the government--Malcolm X or the Black Panthers--or people who tried to make it completely irrelevant, like Marcus Garvey, who wanted black people to sail back to Africa. The government was everywhere we looked, and we hated it.
From Part 4
All of those threads came together at a pivotal moment for me, the moment when I fully crossed from one life to another.
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
'Cause when they're sayin' too much
Life ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills
That's right, it's wicked – that's life, I live it
I break bread with the late heads
Pickin' their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do
And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties
Know she's wishin' we were still close
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
I can't be held accountable, D'evils beatin' me down, boo
Stop screamin', you know the demon said it's best to die
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
It's "The Gift & the Curse"
Now let's be clear, I ain't goin' nowhere
Free, Beans, Memphis where you at nigga?
Goin on my 8th ring, got Phil Jackson's Zen
Flow is black magic, I'm at it again
Now let's be clear, I ain't goin' nowhere
(Hov', Hov', Hov', Hov')
But keep somethin' up my sleeve that'll help me through
I'm like ooh, what's a young nigga to do?
'specially if you don't know my life, don't make me bring
Now let's be clear, I ain't goin nowhere
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss comin' (Yes)
Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?)
And now what’s that you talking bout we gon see now (We gon' see now)
Dig a hole (Go ahead)
Dig a hole (Muthafucka bury yourself)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
I’m like air, lil' shots go through me
I peep these niggas from deep
Left a fingerprint, you ain’t gotta be there
That’s why you dig one big hole, one time
Have we forgotten our history?
Let’s open our bibles
You let that man hype you to go against your idol
Knowing good and god damn well this what I do
Nothin’ left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Came, conquered)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Everybody know you better, you in a lose lose
Outside of your league, that’s not what you do
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)

Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev' and Russell Simmons
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Despite the grim outlook at this point
Jay-Z is taking the stand
Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air
At age nine, saw my first hate crime
Climbed over it, at a early age, Jay shined
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine
Outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation
To accept the charges, press 1 now"
But what I will do
Yeah, nigga, I bet we was kids and had dreams of being here
Yeah, ride with me, your spot is reserved, family
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
You know why they call the projects a project

And the object for us to explore our prospects
In the name of those who ain't made it, my progress
See, I'm the eyes for Emory, keep him alive

I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
I apologize, our love was one for the ages and I contained us
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
I never wanted another woman to know
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times

I'm ridin' big, comin' down that beach
It's Young, Freeway, 8 Miles, let's go!
But I can rewind the calendar back
Back when it was now or nothin'
I could just hear the folks now, "He got what he had comin'."
Now that my eighth album's comin' everybody's smilin'
Claiming they been runnin'
I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suitin' up
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
And them smokers screaming, "One more gram!"
Keep toasters for drama, make Salat with my son
Look back, turn to salt, like the sinners
Set up your brother ‘cause you jealous, nigga
I ever rep, cops watch every step
Cherish every precious breath, state P the second gat
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs
To come up outta her tummy, she got nothing but love for me
When niggas would one me, the industry shunned me
That's why I'm taking all the industry's money
Young is the illest, Free is the future
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Let me be great
After the projects, now we on estates
I'm just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1% of a billion more than niggas even seen
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Feelin' like a stranger in my own land
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland
Wait, tell them rumble young man rumble
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks
Sipping D'USSÉ boy this ain't your daddy yak
And that's just the half of my warpath
'til we all check a billion, shit it's just the way I'm feeling
This beat is like you just walking in place like this
Let me try to get through this here...
If y'all ain't ready to die, my advice would be to
Fast cars, fast temper, draw down faster than y'all
I got to get my shit off, I came from nothin'
I'm much braver than most, got the heart of ghost
I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
I just adjusted my game, pushed 20s of 'caine
Live everyday like my last, like death's approaching fast
Gotta get my shit off (shit off! shit off! shit off!)
Mountains, I think, I'm almost sure
That's why it's less than 8 months, I am back to work
I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
Get off my ass and get about that cash
I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
Live everyday like my last, like death's approaching fast
Live everyday like my last...
All you gotta do is put your hair down, get your mind right
Ain't no place on the planet that you'd rather be
But in the blue flame, bitch you're new to the game
Ears get iced, gear get spiced
You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me
Relax mami, let the Belvy flow
Inhale the 'dro, exhale it slow
I could teach you how to roll, teach you 'bout fly kicks
Get your mind right baby, goin' through mine crazy
I will, holla, for now you on time out
And I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family
C'mon little mama, c'mon
For fuckin' with me, that ain't all you can be
History in the making, part three
Hold me tight and call me your lady (say it louder)
When the summertime is in and the tops are down
C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
From the nada to the Prada
Other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats
The rocks got bigger, watch face got blue
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name (and all my ladies sing)
Sometimes you given just because
But me and you together gon' shine to the end
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name
Hold me tight and call me your lady
So she call me "cabron" plus "maricon"
Always talking out her neck, making her fingers snap
Asked her what tribe she with: red dot or feather
She said: "all you need to know is I'm not a ho
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian and black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken.. damn I'm getting fat
Girls, I do adore
I got this young chick, she so immature
Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time!
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce zeros
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
I'm like, "Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
Girls, I do adore
Girls all over the globe
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
Girls, girls..
For real
Holla at you when I come off tour
So she call me and maricon
Always talking out her neck, making her fingers snap
She said: "all you need to know is I'm not a ho
That's fried chicken, curry chicken.. damn I'm getting fat
Girls, all over the globe
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
Holla at you when I come off tour
Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
I'm like: "excuse me Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Girls, all over the globe
Ain't they know it, when it comes to love, I don't lie (we don't lie, man)
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from (too many ladies, ha)
Woo! Who you lovin', who you wanna be huggin'? Heh
Now all she does is homework, I give her in house tutorin'
In and out I'm movin' through her student body union
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
Yo put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Who said what, why you trippin' girl, why's you fussin'?
And some day I slow down, but for now I get around
Or Caine and O-Dog, stick up tape from Menace
I'm lookin' for a Southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
Vicky cover her titties, attitude of the city
Light kinda dark, short sorta tall
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Put your number on this paper 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour
Ain't gonna say my nose? Can't be over
And they know it, when it comes to love I don't lie [we don't lie man]
I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girls out
Who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin
Holla at ya when I come off tour
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well--I'm in the club for a limited time only
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, big city of dreams
Chi-Town playa out in N-Y-C
My greatest creation was you, you: Glory
My greatest creation was you, you: Glory
Then he died of liver failure
Bad-ass lil Hov
Two years old, shopping on Savile Row
You don't yet know what swag is but you was made in Paris
Everybody go through stuff
You're a child of destiny
Glory! Sorry
My greatest creation was you, you: Glory
I'm so independent, sh..I might buy Koch
Hov got flow though he's no Big and Pac, but he's close
Or you Malcolm X-d out, get distracted by screams
Everybody look at you strange, say you changed
So its best for those to not overdose on being famous
So raise your draw bridge and drown them in the moat
Bills that I do fold, I now invest on
Ain't nothing wrong with baguettes after you get a home
Take care of your home, you can go back and—ugh!
The Edgars And Doug Morris-es-es
Saw it all before, some of y'all thought I was crazy, maybe
The boy money talk no need to converse further
The baby blue Maybach like I own Gerber
I dropped the same date as the Twin Towers
Still I show compassion for others, sent money and flowers
I'm conflicted because, dude
If we the people was given freewill from God
I'm flowin' the baddest, the baddest, I'm the baddest
That nigga don't play, hey, that nigga'll slay
I'm the greatest MC, I'm the greatest MC in the world
I got the ideal skills for real
Better at rippin' it, flowin', kickin' the fly shit
For [?] I'm givin' a bit of advice, slice
Broken down, I'm speedin' it up to 180 thousand trillion mil'
Why ask why when the shit sound this fly?
I see you brought your little crew, and?
Ain't none of you clowns stand your ground
Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now, the heat's on

Hit 'em and split 'em, I did 'em, I get rid of them guys
I'm cuttin' your shit short, hey, alright
And no I don't have it
Yall don't understand? Well god damn don't yall know my status?
No need to explain my name, the only thing that matters

Ugh, the nigga don't play

Out on bail, fifty thou', still riding with toast
I've got all of my mamis
I go with you hard, I ain't gon' stop for shit
Seemed happy when they heard he was arraigned, glad he's indicted
Plus I'm claustrophobic, back on the streets before you know it
And my word niggas, I heard you niggas
I'm address each and every one of you cocksuckers
Fuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever
B.I.G. is here, the soul of 2Pac hovers - above us

(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
You got it Kris-crossed ain't no turning me backwards
I turned in all my rap chips I'm earning my bachelors
Trying not to mess up my axis kid
On the road to the riches through trafficking
Every time I get out they put me right back in
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Tote more Guns than Roses, foes is
A rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again
Everything evens up, you just wait
You ain't even a garbage can you have faith
Life is all about Guns and Roses
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
I went from lukewarm to hot
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Left and right
Che
Yeah keep it best man
Nah nah you don't sing yet man
(I love you)
Flow infinitely like the memory of the homie Biggie, baby!
It's the hard knock life for us
Haters, haters; these niggas is haters
Don’t try this at home: results may vary
Who-va? Hova
I can’t even stomach myself, ulcer!
You know I got it down, dog
Name one thing I ain’t done
I'm running New York
You can’t fade us, you haters
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for frontin'
Bird-ass niggas, I don't mean to ruffle y'all
Ain't no love in the heart of town
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
What, you mad ‘cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
What you eat don't make me shit; where's the love?
Uh, uhh, listen
Whassup y'all niggas all fed up cause I got a little cheddar
Young fucks spittin at me, young rappers gettin at me
Cause faggots hate when you gettin money like athletes
Yung'uns ice-grillin me, ohh - you not feelin me?
Fine; it cost you nothin - pay me no mind
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs
Damn though mans I'm just tryin do me
I don't want much, fuck I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
"Ain't no love, in the heart of town.."
Somebody got somethin to say
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
I'm not lookin at you dudes, I'm lookin past ya
Cunning-ham but the only thing runnin is numbers fam
Jigga held you down six summers; damn, where's the love?
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
What you eat don't make me shit - where's the love?
"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."
"Ain't no love, in the heart of the city.."
"Ain't no love.."
"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems"- gotta move carefully
Somebody got something to say
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Now I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Ok I feel you ma, I said where's the love?
Turner
Break up then I wake up to more bullsh
Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
What you mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Hehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie?
Nigga respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me sh - where's the love?
Ain't no
Ain't no
(I said it ain't no)
(Ain't no)
Ain't no
Uh huh
Yeah right
'Cause too many bastards tried to get they groove on
Don't nobody of mind for this matter
Gather the data until ya mind don't matter!
I bubble like lather, hustle like the lead-off batter
I'll leave ya chest open like vapors for these papers
The nature of mine run deep
My players anthem is get in and get out like a phantom
Jiggy Jigga lookin' gully in the joint
One day when I was ridin on the train I seen these two kids talkin
Check it out now! (I get away with mur-mur-murda!)
Yes, gangsta, gangsta, how y'all wanna do this?
Sadat X like Master P, bring the hook up
He asked for it his man saw it so it don't mean shit to me
He's gone, and that's how it supposed to be
Check it out now! (I get away with mur-mur-murda!)
Have you bowed unto your highness?
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head – this is God body
Food, clothing, shelter, help a nigga find some peace
He's 6'2", how the fuck he fit in a new Bugatti?
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Hello bitch, it's me again
Have you ever seen the gates?
Getting ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?
I confess, God in the flesh
You gotta love it, I arrive at the pearly gates
Niggas asking me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Have you ever seen the gates?
Die for what you believe, only one god recedes
You could be my lady, and have my baby
Hello, Brooklyn, if we had a daughter
And drive my cars, and drive me crazy
Wherever you going, baby girl, just take me
I'm just saying, baby, I'm just saying
But baby, I'ma have to rob him like Horry
And so, I said, "Goodbye, Katrina"
The sweetest sight eyes could see
I said, "Hello, Brooklyn!" Buh-buh-baby, you are (Woo!)
And I say, "Hello, Brooklyn!"
It says my life's too real, check out my ice grill
Ask the dreads 'bout I, how you gwaan 'so?
My fine ho, we got some victims to catch
Where you going? Can I come too?
And they couldn't get cab money from me
Let 'em lean on the cash
I need a chick that practice Tai Chi
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough, my ladies going
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow
She give me good brain
I bet his wrists ain't bluish like this, like this
And I'm from Marcy, you catch me on anybody's block
Reppin' th-the Roc
I was the worst, I used to switch chicks every day
I'm letting her do her and, in turn, she's doing me
This year I'm playing right
We can go bowling it ain't like before
Digging they shit and they couldn't get cab money from me
But chicks I was fiending to smash
But I'm off that playa shit
Promise you'll never let me go
(Hey papi)
I was the worse
In just a, matter of time she was getting with Jay
She used to love ya, but she feeling different today
You used to smother her, look at your honey slipping away
Promise we'll grow, they saying
(Hey papi)
Left me confused, I mess with chicks that was best when abused
Promise we'll grow, they saying
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
If only we could be together momentarily
We could make love, and make history
I’ll be stuck with her sister, her name is defeat
As the crowd screams, for the other team
And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)
So now I’m flirting with death
Took chances repeatedly
A success is all I got, unfortunately
I gotta get lost, I gotta find V
Future of my past, he’ll explain who I be
Long after I’m gone, long after I breathe
That's my last will testimony
(J) uhh (A) uh-uh (Y) uh uh-uh
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro!)
They say "Hola Hovito!"
That's what they sayin' when I ROLL UP with my PEOPLE
My music bangin' like them vatos locos got rap in a choke hold
Once you turn your neck for a sec, your dame's missin'
Put it down for my people
Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
One life to live - notice you get no sequel
I ball for real: y'all niggas is Sam Bowie
M.J., him Jay, fade-away, perfect
"Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!"
Put it down for my people
Naw even though y'all hate, I love y'all muh'fuckers
Friend or Foe y'all all my muh'fuckers
If you haven't heard, I'm Michael, Magic and Bird
"Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!"
"Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!"
It's kinda sexy to me how you watching (I love it)
Tonight you'll be, a superstar
Ooh it's the lights
You need that (Hollywood)
My God, I know how Ozzie Oz
It'll change those who said they had love for you into strangers
When your fame starts, it's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when the train departs
Rapping, stacking, platinum plaquin'
And everybody warning you about it
Ooh it's the lights
James Dean, John Belushi
Hollywood, thank God for Hollywood
Hahaha
And I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why, why our love is so much, ohh
Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
And we're stupid and contagious
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
Psycho bitches in my lobby
Get the hell up off your high horse
Holy Grail
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
20 million a wop, ransackin' mansions
Well, now I hustle for the rush, like fuck it baby
I just love it
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
So I pull over to the side of the road
"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
All because this fool was harassin' them
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!
The new millennium is upon us, the album is here
I don't like playin', niggas can't stick me
$20 million of guap, ransacking mansions
Don't even trust uppity white folk, keep the cannon tucked
Niggas try to lean on Jay, shots gonna stand you up
Whoever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?
I want you to put all your windows down
This is the murderer's version
He'd say, "Jay, what's it about? What's life about?
You take the beating for the friend you don't lay down
You got a war, you got global war
So.. five ten years from now
Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
And I come with doo-rags to your so-called awards
He's still alive, but still fuck you, don't cross my path
Get your CD's out, let's go, song for song
(WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!) Jeah, jeah
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm 'bout to start another life
Look behind you, I'm 'bout to pass you twice
Ain't no livin' person can test him
And that goes for everything from flippin' that raw
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em
Changin' the game, my game could nail Madonna
Live and direct, I will bring it to your set
I got now, I don't care who got next
You ain't a factor, who are you foolin'?
Who was gassin' 'em? (Fuck outta here!)
I fucks with Hova
This remix is for you
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
This is ludicrous! It's preposterous! It's impeccable!
Leave holes, the number one positions, when you hot I'm hot
Oh this is not a gimmick
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
I'm about to start another life
I'm fast, dude can't get past my past
How do you propose deal with the perfect present
And I'm so far ahead of my time
The more tracks I'm on, the more I catch bodies
If not, listen further, you're missing a murder
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable
Flip the numbers, yeah, same year I got on
Shout out to Big, Brooklyn I got this shit
Fuck you, you'll pay me to owe me baby
And I'm out
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable
Through all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in
Choices we make trying to escape
And I don’t need no hook for this shit
This is not for commercial usage
Please don’t categorize this as music
Like Frank Lucas is cool, but I ain't trying to snitch
Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate
Hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch
Hustle hard in, hustle hard in
I pitch her 10 G's tell the bitch to go shopping
I'm all about my cake, I'm trying to marry Betty Crocker
Now I will shoot dice, smoking on a joint
Yo we kept hustling, yo we kept grinding
I fuck em sisters, cousins
It’s a revolving door
I like them Ameriie, you can have them Omarosas
You wanna holla, you can holla take her on a trip
Z comes after Y, we all know that
Go and enjoy life by saying 'Hi Fun!'
More than a fluke I'm regularly wreckin this shit so what now
Stringin it, slangin it, swingin it fat, bring it back
Don't ever sweat it when I go, I zoom back
You kiddin' me no nigga that rap gettin' bigger than me
Before you see me Sauce and Jaz chillin with your wack ass
Brothers who don't have the heart you better tell your mouth nigga
I'm nicer than a bitch, ask this nigga Dash
Now he don't count cause I'm makin his ass rich
Now, the end is near (Can you believe this shit Guru?)
(The REAL hood, like three pair of pants)
Took your high score down, put my name up, nigga
Damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf
Has to explain to her, you think these folks want me in the penthouse
Nobody gave us shit, we made us
We came in this game, not beggin' niggas pardon
We the reason they ain't hand over Def Jam so quick
But that's alright, 'cause they knew they had to see us
Jeah! In my lifetime
So imagine how disturbed I was
This nigga Un yo I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin
Somewhere peaceful for the weekend now it's back to speakin' to vultures
That’s because we handle ours like grown men
I was telling the truth and you Tom Cruise
But y'all don’t respect modest, y'all respect my dollars
My pops got a liver disorder
Got a hundred niggas on your dick saying you ought to record like this
Bitches mad at you, ‘cause they can’t have you
Take my strain and my stride, take my ego and pride
And I hope you, ain’t think I wrote this
Tough niggas get it the worst, I’m begging you come for us
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass
Feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them
It's part of him growing up
A couple of speed bumps, you gotta take your lumps
Crack was anthrax back then, back when
He was off to war killing for a living
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
Days turn to nights, nights turn to years
I never thought shit could end up quite this way
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from
I'm here for the good fight only the fakes run
I'm here for the purple heart, if I can't take one
You don't understand how useless as men we felt
Shout out to my niggas that's locked in jail
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
I'm gon' chase it
You gotta take it, wooo, yeah
Mama say prayer your son's becoming a man
He ain't gon' always make the right choice, understand
Every choice that he make he makes it for his fam
Don't cry we all gonna die eventually
But if he's locked in the penitentiary send him some energy
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes fast
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass
If I should die, don't cry, my niggas
Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
If I should die...
In the middle of the drought, I flipped pies, my niggas
Skated through with the Caesar picadas
Rocked jewels, dropped school, still didn't fail
Rhymes still written well, hold court in the street
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters fuck
... don't cry, my niggas
I got a lot to look back on, in '88 got my crack on
Ten years later gettin' my rap on
And tell him never have a friend
Just family, reincarnated I'll shorten the time
That I waited to get paid, tell him never be afraid
Niggas hearts pump Kool Aid and yo' blood run thicker
... don't cry my niggas
I'm the aftermath of pleasure never die alone
I cut corners and took drastic measures
If I should die don't cry, my niggas
When I'm gone live on, my niggas
... don't cry, my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
Run into Pac ask him where we went wrong
Tell him life is miserable when ya dealin' in the physical form
My game is ultra magnetic-al, While I'm steady G'ing
So I keep making motions, Plus avoid all my failures
We bomb the world with musical drugs and fly live a dove
If you want it (Make it happen everyday of you're life, baby)
If you want it (baby)
Stay fly from the boot up
Like, computer

Yo, peep the scripts, scoped honey from the whip

You can stop saying mine
They think I'm sexy
I know what boys like
They think I'm sexy
No neighbors, make all the noise you want to make
Before they reach the door
Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop
Cop Rembrandt, hang 'em, pay the lot
I know what girls like
I know what they want
Ghetto like the grease when you getting ya hair braided
Sweeter than ya sister Kool-Aid is
I'm talking when spaceships are around and ya great-great grands
All I ask is you raise your glass in this celebration
I remember you saving for the light bill, paid the rent with the light bill
I was okay with not having everything
I know pop looking down
I gotta be like the pioneer to this shit, you know
When all y'all niggas thought it was beer and shit, you know
I got, I got to be the pioneer to this shit, man
I got bail money, double-XL money
You got flash now, but time will reveal money
That down-South, Master P, Bout It Bout It shit
That brown paper bag under your mattress drug money
Imaginary playmates
Origin-al, Jigga's the future, flow digit-al
Still busting a gat when shit gets criti-cal
Imaginary playmates
But this year I've done it again, Jigga! What the fuck?
Rock more Versace, ain't nothing sweet
It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game
You bought a 4.0 you better get your change
Ain't no platinum in those Cartiers, switch your frames
Ain't no manicures on board, then switch your plane
You'll probably hop on my dick right there, right in front of your bitch
I affiliate, with Billy Gates, that's my peer
I see Benjamins and a billion other big head people
Roc Nation army, million strong and the mantra's gon' be
Jump in the Humvee, y'all can call it Cold War
But I do that, I'm so past, G5's and G4's
Motherfucker I'm ill!
Rashad is missing you, your mom is missing you (n-n-n-n-no no no)
All we listen to is all the different yous
We used to party-hop, we used to be in the Hamptons, party a lot
Remember cereal pie, one of your favorite plates (I miss you)
Due to the circumstances, it could've been Bellevue
Your uncle's missing you, your family's missing you
But he got issues, enough of that lame
I never seen pain like your parents' pain
So professional, our little purple star
Carline is missing you, Tiny is missing you
By the way, B.I.G., we missing you, Pac, we missing you
Y'all left a void, it's a lot of little yous
They just studied your flows and they watched your interviews
B.I.G., you'd be ashamed to see New York gangbang
Pac, you'd feel the same thing, they use your name in vain
But I guess that's the issue
Pun, we missing you, Big L, we missing you
This goes, to the memory of all our fallen soldiers
He did it his way, so I have no other choice but to do it my way
I drop bombs and niggas see me with that dough by eight o'clock
My feet never touch the concrete, just street sweep awards
And get a project nigga paid up the asshole
80% of these niggas with deals
Can't see me with the dough, uh
I need a whole lot of cash
Oh, you gon' pay me, y'all niggas ain't crazy
My crib is mean, watchin' a hundred inch screen
Is from a sauna, lettin' bubbles shoot up your ass if you wanna
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
I need a whole lot of dough
My style, ladies intoxicated by my profile
You need to feel how sweet the skills be
To come and slide down Sugar Hill with me
The high roller, rolled up on your dice game
I never slept, cause sleeping keeps you deep in debt
Haha, f'real, Jay-Z lives
Everybody from Brooklyn
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
Say my goodbyes to the straight and narrow
Copped my first key, took a freeze, now I'm frozen
Still on the phone, discussin' my biz like it could never be mines
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
The Big Willie get you chilly when I pass, brrrrrr
I'm talkin' big cheese, you gotta be down to dig these (uhh)
"In my lifetime"
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
Sports cars, the good life'll give you a belly
Now my poems just ain't poems, they bloody when I recite 'em
Now, I'm a hardened criminal with game
Still the thrill makes me blind to the fact
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
Take the analogy of a tree that grows in Brooklyn among the steel and the concrete with all its glorious branches and leaves, one day it too will pass on its legacy through the seeds it dropped to the ground and as the wind carries these seeds throughout wherever they might move a new life will begin for each one of them as they stand as a monument to the one that came before
That came before...
White man owned it, so they owned him
Nobody owns me though."
But rather how many rocks you move while owning watch
(Gangsters, hustlers, republicans, democrats, pimps and hoes)
(Gangster mentality, an American way created by the white
OKAY, I'M RELOADED!
Uh-huh, I've did it again niggas
No...
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct
But only a single goin' gold?
Then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
Young blood, you better get that, we frying because
And don't listen to the rappers yo, they dying to floss
Burnt the turnpike, wild miles on the V
Started from the crack game and then so sweet
Freaked it to the rap game, Jigga the O.G
Always knew I'd make a stop there
I'm retiring, ain't enough money in this game to keep me around
"Trying to come up in the game""Marcy"
"Just give me the word"
Game I peeped those, my mind so advanced
Screw Gooden, I pitch in the PJ's
Shit is constant, that's why I pack the
Flashy, fly little nigga
And I'm serious
Yeah, what the fuck!
Clown-ass niggas (Yeah)
If that ain't reason for concern (woo!)
Ain't nothin' touchin' from Brooklyn to Metuchen
Shopped up in Neiman's, locked hip-hop up between us
Squeamish rappers stay out of my space like Venus
In the driver's seat, nigga used to live in the back
Fuck y'all, I ain't forgivin' that (Fuck y'all!)
You blast for me, you better believe I blast for you
Yeah!
What, we rock on y'all, representin' the
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Jigga, they can't touch ya
Say y'all, we livin' like STNRs (?)
Collect it like antiques, and let it stack
Brrrrrrr, like that
I mastered this fast shit, now I move on
And now you see me jiggy, you puzzled
Got my feet up on you sofa, man
I eat a hostess from my open hand
In fact I diss her I'm a bolder man
Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill
Yo, yo, why you home alone, why she out with me?
How foul is she? And you wifed her
Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?
From cats who order Cris' play the floor with the Knicks
It can only lead to something unfortunate
How the hell can you knock that?
Jigga Man, who you supposed to be?
I'm whip it in the stomach
Why you acting so funny?
Bust in her ass
The game don't stop
Can't help it if she's in love with a rider
While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?
With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes
Say, "Hey, I'm new in town, I don't know my way around
FYI, I never been robbed in my life"
Let her introduce you 'round town like her man
Still there Brooklyn?
Jigga Man, holla {*click*, *dial tone*}
Don't get fresh, let 'em know you small change
Wanna speak to me direct, hit extension trey-pound, I'm out
What seem to be the problem young boy?
Shut the fuck up! Matter of fact, hold on
When you talkin on the phone to hus-tlers
Never hold out, pull out, throw heat and be out
Pass the number til you're stackin balls
I take cash or write the check out to F-R
Some baking soda to make you Hova"
I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot
Belly full, I can't shake it
The hunger in my belly has been replaced with other forms of starvation
And I'm alright with that
It's sad but it's true, but niggas ass gon' turn blue
Won't let me lose it, 'til I'm undisputed
Speeches I prepared that I never spoke
Must've been some pain in your past, too
Must've been a karma that was past due
Never treated my brother like a step, Pop
What was you preparing us—
For?
Leader of the pack, you see that in your youngins
Shot junk in your arms, more than your veins was punctured
I punted on feelings, 'cause you said you was coming
You couldn't kick the habit, I wish you said something
You can't avenge these many sins with your own hands
I'm just thankful that I get all these gifts to unwrap
Last night I had a dream, thoughts was racin through my head
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
"I agree," I said, "my one of a kind self"
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
Hanging pictures on my wall
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
"Got the whole industry mad at me," I said
And I'm gunning for the Pennant
And I been this, God made me
It's the return of the Messiah
No I ain't God but I've been made in his mould
I only fold bread
So the next motherfucker can earn his paycheck
He's a grown man, you're an infant to him
I spent that on furniture
I got Basquiats in the lobby of my spot
Timbo on the track, 250 for the beat
I spent a couple mil' just to lose to the Heat
And I'm never, ever going back, back
Whoever rap, you be doing that for practice, nigga
I'm a rapper's rapper
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
They conniving, shit, the first chance to crack the bank
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still pounding in my after life
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
Friends will tell me I should leave you alone
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You gotta watch your friends, you got to watch me, they connivin'
Time to kill it on your belly no question
Had more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon
So when I shoot, meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
​​​Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah​​​
Lookin' half black and Filipino, fakin' no jacks
You know these hoes be makin' me weak
The chrome rim spinnin' keeps them grinnin'
I play hard until they say "God
Nigga, get a grip, what you don't see is what you get
Weapons concealed, what the fuck y'all feel
When you niggas play sick we can all get ill
Fox Brown.. (what the deal?)
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
​​​Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah hah​​​
Man of their own, man of their own)
Yo, ain't no stoppin' this, no lie
Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs
Remember the days you was dead broke
So who the player? I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor-made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin'
On how I fuck the best and shit
Before this rap shit, when you was in leathers and bullshit Berettas
Now all your mens is up in your Benz's
I took a little when you was up north, your commissary stay pilin'
Fucks no, I see half of that dough
Ain't no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
(Keeps you in diamonds and leathers)
Friends'll tell me I should leave you alone
(Tell the freaks to find a man of their own
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
Mmet your death in less than 8 seconds
No one can fuck you betta
Tell the freaks to find a man of there own
You can't change a players game in the 9th inning
He's keepin it real jigga stay hard
When you nigga play sick we can all get ill
Chorus
So who the playa, I still keep you in the illest gators
Specially when Im flippin Baileys
I push disease, eatin shrimp diamond rocks larger than life
I got you frontin in Armani sweaters
Playin inside my pubic hairs
I took a little when you was up north
Make you wonder a star
Chorus
No need..for you to ever sweat the next bitch
And keep your ass tighter than Versace thats why
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
Laugin my shit is tight
Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah ha
Lookin half black and filipino fakin no jacks
Surrouding your feet in Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan
Yall knows how it goes 'b and so I creep
You can't change a players game in the 9th inning
The chrome rim spinning keeps em grinnin
I play hard-eh till they say God..
Weapons concealed what the fuck yall feel
-whats the deal-
Promise to stay monogamous, I try
Y'all knows how it goes B so I stay deep
What up boo just keep me laced in the illa snakes
Flippin weight..heroin and shit

I took a little when you was up north
Your comisary stay pilin
Fucks no, I see half the dough
Killer Cali, nigga (same song)
And all points between they know about your man
Konichiwa ladies when I'm out in Japan
Now I bounce six-fours up and down Crenshaw
And handlin' a model, standin' about five-eight
Then it's back home, nigga, back to the zone
A couple fiances, I'm the new DeVante
A ticket and your favourite CD - sweet Sade
Sade, Sade, don't you know I love you sweet Sade, Sade
Real pranksters in the Chi, most of them real folks
Then we party like the sun don't set
{*harmonizing to the end*}
It's the Roc! Wooo!
The whole industry can hate me, I thugged my way through
From blowin' Swisher Sweets outta candy drops
And learn how to earn better, I burn cheddar
I blow smoke in your face, burn rubber off of rim tires
A sunny day, some chicks they wanna play
Come on… now
I got a little two-two, I call her Peggy Sue
'Cause it's foul ways nowadays, everybody saw you
In this time and age, what's a real muh'fucka to do
R to the O to the C comin' true
Armadale in the club, couple of duckets (yeah)
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride
The whole Roc is jumpin', we reached our zenith
Got fiends throwin' up on themself like Willie Beamen (hehe hehe)
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit
Plus the jab is sick, and it's Zab quick
Mean bucket... (uh huh)
A doo-rag and a pocket full of loot (got those)
Broad Street Bully
Young! (All I need) H to the izzo
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
(All I need)
Known for ballin' the hardest, holdin' our own in our post
Known for soakin' ya folks, sendin' hoes to ya coast
Climbin' in them hoes
I remind you of that dough
Yo, yo
I'm still hot, I'm still S.Dot ya'll
I'mma stay hot no matter what my shit does
I'm Destiny's Child, my fate's been sealed
But my theory is the sun shines clearly
Untouchable, can't fuck with dude
Duck spit, arm shake, who wan' gon' play
Flow's like sniffin' a hundred grams
Jigga, what
Jigga, what
Flow like none other, I'm the meanest, toughest, done dotta to gun-butcher
(Young! It's the life)
Get so high oh, get so high, high off the life
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
Turn the pot up, make a soufflé
Say "hooray" to the bad guy, and all the broads
All in the name of love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
It called me right back
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
Yeah I said its the life
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa...it's real
Mix the water with the soda
All in the Name of Love
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
Now it gets tough to ever love again
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
Go through a thing I guess, brings out my best
But I'm far out of reach like Abdul-Jabbar
I'm so into this life, you know who I are
Every corner, every hood, nigga ghetto superstar
You either love me or leave me alone
Fall from the top (top)
The shit that I'm on (hey)
Hey, I'm already home
Now one more 'gin
They want me to stop (no)
They want me to go (no)
Hey, I'm already home
They want me to stop (stop)
Hey, I'm already home
Not in the same league, don't shoot at the same baskets
Half man half mammal, my sign is a Sag
This is just what I planned to do, oh, don't be mad
Oh, they want me to fall (fall)
The shit that I'm on (hey)
Hey, I'm already home
I'm a work of art, I'm a Warhol already
H-O-V, I got my own lane, already (already)
I done cooked up the rock already
So why the fuck can't y'all get hot already? (Already)
Put your name in the pot already
And I am nigga I'm already home already (already)
They want me to drop (drop)
I'm already gone (gone)
I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Jigga, uhh uhh uhh, uh-huh
Pa-pa, uhh, pa-pa, uhh
The G, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Drinking sake, it's me, and my mami with the doobie
Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance
A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy
"Surely you jest," she said, "if you thought I was purely
Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine
Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)
Touch me with, a heart of gold
Touch me with, a smile of gold
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine
I might let you kick it if you don’t tell the missus
Quick, run, before the tabloids come
Tell me if this is true
Would like to extend an invitation to you
Dreamed of you this morning
I never, felt that before
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Mama forgive me, should be thinking about Harvard
Nothing wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
(I'm just American dreamin')
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
But there's always, that's all, that's all baby
Like Tony La Russa on how you play your Cards
Now let's start, on your mark
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
I never felt that before
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
And the cops is coming, you could read they mind
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I'm from the '80s
Home of the her-on
So it's plain to see where my whole plan come from
American dream, I'm living the life still
I hear his voice in my mind like, nigga live on
I'm give it to my sons
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame
If the sky should fall
And it all goes tomorrow and they foreclose on the house
In Ibiza, I had pizza in the club
Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love
Now they wanna do your boy like Mike in his prime
Can't lie, they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo
Here's to the man that refused to give up
I want the sky nigga, chuuurch
I want the sky baby
Uh-huh, I've did it again niggas
Ugh! Nice watch, do you really have a spot?
Like you said in "Friend or Foe," and if so, what block?
What you doin' in L.A., with Filipinos and Eses
BLAOW!
Four days out the week, find me in the kitchen
Papi gave me one pie, but it cook like two
Cats around my way was buying brand new whips and shit
Looking like blue lasers, never fugaz-es
Act courageous, I smack 'em with the two aces
So y'all hoes know who's best—Jigga!
So when I take flight, it's from Hangar 6
Then I pop up, and tear your block up and kick off like soccer
In a Range Rove, twist hoes like ankles
I hit y'all with a million more
Lookin at me all funny, while I'm countin my money
Fo' sure, everythings for dough now
Get wetted up by the sleeve that leave the bezel out
Y'all don't like it? Sue me, fuck I'll settle out
Ghetto'd out in the vehicle Bent
What I do is already legalized
Spiritualy and mental, what you into I done been through
Ain't nothin changed, but players, the game remains the same
Layin there shiverin, half the night
Blowin like Tahitii, throw off NYPD
And pagers, rollin ten deep to Las Vegas
Wit gators, feedin peoples, from the bridge to Dequatas
But now, two years five months and 30 days later
You gotta let it bump
If you should die, I’ll keep him like mine
I'd risk everything
Anything for you
I know Momma, your little baby
"Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them"
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
That wasn’t the life meant for you
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
Put my face on his body don’t wait for nobody
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
Don't listen to your crew, do what works for you
You see the snakes in the grass and you wait on their ass
If you're wrong, my nigga
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Roc-a-fella y'all
Big freak y'all
Thirty eight waist enough to keep one nine in
But when the gat is tucked I'm fat as fuck
No kids but trust me I know how to raise a gun
Niggas that think I spend my days in the sun
Don't talk to me about MC's got skills
Jay Z's that deal, I be's in the field
But none of y'all rappers can fool with me
With that new blue Yankee on, who but me?
Yeah I blew, few million than I blew to three
And I would name names but they ain't as important to that
Homies throwing me shade ain't shit sunny
I'm a hustler, accept that
No correctional facilities can correct that
Gotta get away some tried to head back
Three smart niggas got left back
Not before Christ, but a long time homie
I'm in the back, got my partners with me
Haha, keep that
Through the traffic lights, fuck traffic at night
We here having the time of the life
It's just the clarise
I got my (shh) outside of the city
Anything you want girl
Ooh you so nasty, amateur pole dancing
She tried to rain dance, money so long it'll drown you girl
Buried under so much stacks
Anything you want girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You turned my Maybach back seat into the Hotel De'Paris
You know, you know you hot like fire
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
In the Matrix have patience, got lots of bottles
I'm a D boy, they decoys, they money is lighter
Anything you want girl
You know, you know, you know (you hot)
Just put it on the floor baby
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
And Bruce Springsteen...
Can you imagine, that’s where the country was? That just that she had his arm...and you see the look in his eyes, it's like, “you know, you dumb English broad, you’re gonna get me lynched." I’m just putting it in perspective; that’s where he’s coming from.
I feel like a lot of this record is about the love/hate relationship you have with fame, certainly that first track, the title track.
“Holy Grail,” it’s about acknowledging that you’re dancing with this drug, you know, and that people have lost their lives behind it, you know, this fame thing, and where to draw the line and how to maintain a sense of yourself within it. We look at all the people that came before us who are no longer here with us, you know, have been in this dance with fame. And it’s just me just really thinking out loud and vocalizing and hopefully dealing with it in some ways. It’s sorta like my therapy.
Um, Obama.
Well...
It’s total concern trolling.
And I think that the it's also bizarre to act like people don't care about violence in in inner cities or affecting black communities in the United States. I think it's a hugely important issue, especially in local politics where crime issues are actually dealt with. But it really it really is just an effort to change the subject.
It's also the case, and this goes back to our other argument, one of the things Republicans have been able to do is cut budgets, so there are a lot fewer police officers in every city in America. And social workers, and other people who might take a preventive kinda situation. And also, by the way, that’s why unemployment is too high; we've created on a private sector jobs, but the Republican priorities have cut over a million have public sector jobs, and that’s cops and others. So they’ve caused that kind of problem by denying the cities the resources that they could use to try to do with the problem.
Let me just finish this point because I do want to scare them a little bit: It's going to be a problem that no amount of police can solve, because, you know, once you have that sort of oppression, you know, and that gap is widening, it’s inevitable that something is going to happen.
I agree with that, but that does not mean you don't need police in the short term, and I completely disagree: Stop-and-Frisk is an abuse of people’s rights, but the African Americans I talk to, and that including those in Congress, don't want fewer police--they want better policing. But they want more policing. It’s like Bill said, “Oh, the ambulance came very quickly because you were in a white neighborhood; a sad joke with some truth to it. So denying them the resources is the problem, the notion that because some police have misbehaved you want fewer police. I don't know any significant percentage in the African-American community...
They deserve to get out of there. Public housing was a temporary stop, right?
Hahahahaha.
I think it's also important to remember: crime is still falling. We've had a massive improvement--
Local police budgets are not getting bigger; they're being shrunk. If you work at the local level, if you work with police chiefs, and the people want the services from the police. Yes, you got to make them better, but in Los Angeles--
(We're the fire that remains) Turn Rell up a lil bit
And every hood in the world discussin' me
It's Neef Buck (Neef Buck) out the cut (out the cut)
And interviews thought you could hold Sparks in the hood
I'm that gallstone trapped in the belly of the beast
Busters know if you cross the line, thinkin I'm off my job
Thinkin them slugs'll fly
Your girls skirts and veils, she undressin', don't stare
When I'm done! Make a run with The Roc
When I come! Through customs, cops can't bust him
I thought I'd finish his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
Every day, a star is born (And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day, a star is born (And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day, a star is born
December 4th, a star was born
Clap for him! He went from moving that corner
They come, they go, some real, some faux
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far away life
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him! Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
I'm here now! Fayettenam
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Ayy (J. Cole!)
Every day, a star is born
That's right
Growin' up in the hood, just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for all to see
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Them crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
It's on
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
Funny what seven days can change
Told you put away some cheddar, now you cryin' for bail
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
The same game that make you math could make you die
(That's life) It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good, shut your mouth
On the show as well were Third Eye Blind and Kelly Clarkson.. I thought that to be the oddest pairing EVER but, soon realized, it’s what I’ve always professed..There is NO such thing as BLACK music or WHITE music only GOOD or BAD music..It’s stupid cool to like things that are not like you, and that goes for outside of music.. If you’re an African American you can have a jewish friend. Wait, does Lyor having some Israeli mixed with his jewish count? (Sure they are paranoid but, so are black people after they’ve smoked weed, haaaaa, and plus the JEW fro and the BLUEprint fro are the SAME thing.)
I think, um… Two things. Roc-a-fella Records. Um, building the brand and the label. And also, the—the brand of Jay-Z. To say, “I weathered the storm. I’m not just a rapper. I’m a—a CEO, I’m a entertainer, um, I’ve done… I have a vodka company, I have a clothing company… Um… I have, uh, 47 employees—um, um—as far as Roc-a-fella Records. And I’m not sta- stopping here. I have a S-Dot Carter shoe coming out, uh… I’m on—I’m doing the first Showtime special ever in fifteen years.” Um… Jay—I don’t think Jay’s done. And I think we have a lot to foresee [echoes & fades out]
Just talk whenever I want?
Holding it down on the corner with my block frozen
Cause my shit is brillo
Manic depressive and my head hurts
Yo, give me your doe and your ho
And a straight razor will put pin stripes, across your wind pipes
You think I don't get tempted, that would be a lie if I told it, can't hold it
We fight with those who fight with us but nigga I ain't the one
You niggas oughta be glad OG got hold of us
So when you get to hell you tell 'em Blanco sent ya
We the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do
Emory passed you niggas and he did a bid
Them su, su, su, su, su
Niggas could not be further, I fathered your style
Birth of a Nation, Nat Turner style
I'll line you all up with one finger wave
Gangsta nuh live in a tenement yard
And them su, su, su, su, su
And them su, su, su, su, su
I come to nice up the whole nation
Can't you see it's my ambition
I come to nice up the whole nation
Cake and dumpling season, spinners and dumpling season
Don't play by the king, love is all I and I bring you know
Top ranking, keep it skanking
Ooh wee, huh, hear me now
I'm so far ahead of my time I'm 'bout to start another life
Back to The Future, gotta slow up for the present; I'm fast
When I unwrap The Gift & The Curse in one session?
Don't get it twisted, get it right
Did it different, did it better, did it nice
Did the impossible, and then I did it twice
Prepare poems with a passion, at the same time cash in
I only bring my homies back purple reefer
I only smoke in Ibiza
You thought Summer Jam was starring you? It was starring me
You on the radio crying, I'm learning to swim
They call me eight shows H-O
Ball so hard, I don't respect the fuckin' referees
D-boy drug dealer look
D-boy drug dealer look
Billionaire nigga!
From the coca leafs to the farmers
Maybach, 3 TV's all up in the headrest
Hoop earrings, coupes with the rear cameras
I'm not your average dope dealer
Me and Teflon Q45 infinite
Collab from Versace's place
D-boy drug dealer look

Hear my angels singing to me (are you happy, Hov'?)
Colleek, are you praying for me?
So I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays
In hopes that she'll be okay
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream to me
So have no fear, just know that
Life is but a beach chair
I hear my angels sing...
Life is but a dream
Can't mimic my life, I'm the thinnest cut slice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes with this life just eyes
Your corazón is what brought us home
A guide for your eyes, and so you won't lose scent
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream
I hear my angels sing
Girl, why you never ready? For as long as you took
You can keep ya beach 'cause that beach whatever
Started out at The Darby, ended up at 1 Oak
I replace it with another one
Khaliq, Ramel, Pharrell in the house
(The Neptunes is in the house)
Soon as the beat drop, we got the streets locked

Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!

Y'all section a little weak, all y'all gotta bounce right now
Beautiful beautiful. Ok we are 7 now y'all getting it
Let's describe a certain female
(Bitch) you like my style and you smell my cologne
Hit off with paper, you gonna get hit off and slid off
And not the way he dribbles or ball or draw lyrics
You're a (Bitch), No ma, you're a (Bitch)
Sisters give-up the ass, bitches give-up the ass
Bitches don't give a fuck, they wanna check for your homie
I love my sisters, I don't love no bitch
I'm from a crack in the wall, a fighter with my back against wall
Grew up on Lexington Ave, my socks real high
They had the best beef patties and cocoa bread
Played the Albee Square Mall 'round the time I was gettin' tall
Brownsville, where the warriors come out to play
Momma's gon' pray
The wolves is on the job
And we got guns big as Samoans
To see a marching band
Would you be the savior of the broken
"Because one day I'll leave you
At 10 pounds, when I was born I didn't give her no pain
I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose
He said, "Will you defeat them
Got on my pimp game
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
I'm a hustler now
Supposedly, knowing nobody paid Jaz wack ass
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Good-bye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowing cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
Except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black)
My father took me into the city
"Because one day I'll leave you
No more Reasonable Doubt, I've proven to be the illest MC
Something's wrong with ya motor skills 'cause y'all ain't movin' me
I paint pictures beautifully but niggas is near sighted
I slay the track laid back, almost 'til it's a sin
Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit
Bricks who get money quick see me
I be the, X like Malcolm
It's like livin' with yo homie that be on crack
In fact my niggas know my style's phat like hoes in the El Dorado
Any thing but the main gun I don't trust 'em
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
Cool with the nigga huh, fro main chilla
Triple your cash criple your stash pass shooker
My peeps fuckin' up in the streets keep guessin'
She hit me with a felion a young pair kitten
Even holdin snow balls and I ain't talkin 'bout mittens
Lyrics from Snippet
-A nigga get excited by the dice games
When I'm passin' through your territory with the beat lifted
Apply to a different school and wait 'til I'ma grade her
If she merk you for-
Hey nigga I was in Oakland, Oakland like Brooklyn
They showed me so much love when I was down there I had to get hyphy on this one
Please have respect like your talkin to your mom
As you see we be talkin rather often (chatterbox!)
The ROC Boys in the buildin
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
Hold up, I gotta keep it real
This is chess, know the difference 'tween the king and the pawn
Yeah, so what if you flip a couple words?
I got Creole C.O. bitches for my niggas
You already know what the bidness is
That's okay with me, that's where they made me at
I spin my work in the pot, so I can spend my bread
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together
Can't you tell that I came from the dope game?
I ran contraband that they sponsored
I ain't talkin' about it, I'm livin' it
Stay your course, and you'll understand
Feds, they like wack rappers
D.A. wanna indict me
When it end, I'ma stand as a man
So let the champagne pop
Don't waste your time fighting the life
Blue Magic, that's a brand name
("JAY-Z won't give me no money.")
Y'all mention JAY-Z name?
Give me some more music in the headphone
Let's do this thing (let's do it right this time)
I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
I set the trap just to see dude react, and now
And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez
H-O-V-A
H-O-V-A
Can't y'all see that he's fake, the rap version of T.D. Jakes
I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine
They call me this misogynist
'Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice
And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa
I'm back before you had a chance to miss me
You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob – listen, God, you a flea
They feel my pain and my agony, nigga
I won't rest 'til you on one knee
You want war, then this war's gon' be, nigga
Until you on one knee
I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
Feel me now, listen!
Hootie babysitted, changed my diapers
Valencia's boyfriend Volvo had me making moves
Jaz made me believe this shit was real
Oh, can't forget my man down in Maryland
And your son too—there's nothing I won't do
New rap patrolling the city, follow my crews
Your time is coming: you one hit away
And if you think I say, then innocent if I say?
Everything I feed, everything I read
Got poison in my pen, thank god for Lulu
I'm crazy, you ever leave me I might have to put on a gris-gris
Spell for us to stay together
Facelessness
Maison Margiela embracing
More than ever my niggas gon' have to stick together, feel me?
Already ahead of your end, in the foreign bumping Fela, feel me?
We, we, we, family
All the fellas from the favelas 'round me, feel me?
Bismillah, all the gods around me
Mexicanos ain't building fucking walls around me
'Cause we family
I feel like Ali
More worried about Trump than anyone overseas, feel me?
We'll put a little bit of '95 in there, you know what I'm saying?
We gon' take y'all back to school, real quick
We gotta adjust the game, put it back where it's suppose to be
What type of jewels to cop, you could rule this shit
Manolo Blahnik or Jimmy Choo's for your chick
If you want her on the stand
Ran errands for the bosses
Hehehehe, hehehehe
It's history baby
I spring train in the winter, 'round early December
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends
Push up on my money (push up), I'm in great shape dunny (woo!)
Like a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch
I pump in Roc sweats, all white trainers
Then y'all niggas better squat, I drop your set for rep
Lyrical exercise, y'all niggas ain't tired right?
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy...
We don't struggle with undeveloped muscles
No matter how many pounds you bring
What you bettin', Biggs?
Ain't nobody snitchin or nothin; you know our team is tight
Sandy cake face ass nigga (fuck outta here)
Ayo, Jay, word up
Shit, I ain't fronting
We keep our pockets fully blown
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gasping for air in Aspen
Slinging your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Beijing
Money flaring like nostrils for drug dealing apostles, huh
'Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
I drop the stellar, even acapella
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Money make the world go around so I made some to spend
Two point two pounds
Bring it on if you think you can hang
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread lettuce heroes get deadish
Absence of malice in my palace
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feeding me
Steam a nigga scheming on the wrist action with the gleams
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Yeah, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Yeah, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Can't stop the flow when all we know is crime
Talk broken english and drug selling
Get yourself a couple of shorties that shoot a Glock with ease
And let's start clocking G's, never let Bobbito sell you flour
Don't ever sell a tray on my block you'll need the doc-
I can't teach you how to stash, see myself I hold cash
Before the sun rose we was out chasing dollars
First it was capsules, now its fish scales and selling weight
Stashing, staying in fashion, putting cash in
Once your clientele's grooving without you nothing's moving
This shit is deeper than the streets, we're working for the government
A magnet to selling small white crack mints
Putting my ass on the line like a trapeze artist
I gotta blow, watch for the smoke
Psychologists have said it takes 21 days to make or break a habit. On the 22nd day, you’ve found the way.
Brooklyn, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Go hard)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
I'm a Brooklyn boy, I may take some gettin' use to
Like oranges-es, I'm dangerous
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
I father, I Brooklyn-Dodger them
With no intentions of returnin' tomorrow
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
It's my turn
We chase niggas around they own ball game
Ball game nigga, it's over for you lames
Fuck y'all broads
Didn’t they ever tell you don’t fuck with a man’s family They'll fuck with y'all's?
If you're ballin’, nigga what I’m doing can’t be defined
Foreign rides, outside, it's like showbiz (It's my turn)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused
I sound like I'm supposed to sound, meet me at the Clearport
Manhattan keep on faking it, Brooklyn keep on taking it! Yeah!
Yeahh! Shoutout to all my real niggas in Harlem
This ain't about boroughs, this is about niggas and bitches
Jigga... (Jigga), Bigga... (Bigga)
Ayo, peep the style and the way the cops sweat us (uh-huh)
Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle (mhm)
Most hated
Can't fade it (uh, what?)
But on the con-trilli, I packs the MAC-milli
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin' soft on him
Tryin' to push 700s, they ain't made them yet
Jay-Z, Big' Smalls, nigga shit your drawers
(Jigga) Jay-Z
My Bed-Stuy flow's malicious, delicious
From 62s, Gemstars, my mom's dishes (uh)
No more mister nice guy, I twist your shit
Chill, homie, the bitch in the Shoney's told me

("Brooklyn... Brooklyn... Brooklyn...")
Nigga please, like short sleeves I bear arms (um!)
Me and Gutter had two spots
The 2-for-5 dollar hits, the blue tops (uh-huh)
If Fay' had twins, she'd probably have two Pacs (uh!)
Cristal forever, play the crib when it's mink weather (uh!)
The M.A.F.I.A. keep cannons in they Marc Buchanans (uh!)
Usually cuatro cinco, the shell sink slow
I'm warnin' ya (Hah, what the fuck?)
(Where you from?) Brooklyn goin' out to all
(Flatbush...) You don't stop
(Where you from?) Brooklyn goin' out to all
(Clinton Hill...) You won't stop (nigga!)
Representing BK to the fullest
You better stop playing with me
Don't need radio to do my thing
Your SoundScan going down
You better off selling them now
Now I realize Puff paper ain't enough
And I know y'all don't know but G4's ain't cheap
And B she gotta ride G3 (nothing less)
They screaming from the peanut gallery
I kill shit 'til I catch Will Smith
Then I'm running Spielberg down (yes)
Or read about 'em later, nigga
How's it feel to be a hater?
I'm in power in a Maybach with the missing towers
I'm considered one of the best 'cause I wreck shit the worst
If it leaks into the street, I won't sleep
I'ma creep, 'til I rest one of your peeps
And I promise on my momma, I'm just trying to keep the peace
Your SoundScan going down
You better off selling them now
Can you bounce wit me, bounce wit me, ge-gi-gi-gi-gi-gi
Ya-yah-yah, ya-ya-yah-yeah bounce wit me, bounce wit me
Can I hit in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse, if I was broke would you want me
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Do you need a baller, so you can shop and tear the mall up
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
To these bitches from all of my niggas
To these niggas from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggas without dubs
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough
To these niggas from all of my bitches
Now can you bounce wit me, uhh
How we gonna get around on your bus pass
Get it up I put it down e'rytime it pop up, huh
I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa
My - coochie remains in a Gucci name
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough
Can I get a woop woop
To these bitches from all of my niggas
Uhh!
Gi-gi-gi-gi can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me
If not Boo, you know what, I still fucked you
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough
To these niggas from all of my bitches
To these bitches from all of my niggas
Who don't got love for niggas without dubs
Wit me wit me wit me bounce wit me, bounce wit me
Maybe go back 96
Bounce with me with me with me
Right side can you bounce with me
Jigga's kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Baby girl, if this is so, yo
Sort of a desperation
Prefer you call me William
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin' cream
You playin' the games, I'm seein' the thing through
Can I keep goin'? I wrote... Can I keep goin'?
{Laughing}
Got the whole world sayin' "How he still so good?"
Sorry Lance I'm just tryna advance my quotes
You should let it out the cage, if not fuck it
It's tuggin, at my heart but this time apart is needed
Niggas can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood y'all lucky
But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Non-Pulp Fiction, Colt 4-fifth and
Young niggas that blasphemy, blast for me, no religion
Is y'all niggas finished?
Don't even hate on those who hate me, I got Pac on
And black guns, stack ones yo
Can I live, for all my chicks pigeon-toed
But they can't lock me down, 'cause my tool is the truth
Yeah I sold drugs for a living, that's a given
My mind been through hell, my neighborhood is crime central
And all I see is life cycle just repeating itself
Holla at you faggots that it's my block to burn
I know heads getting annoyed and knew all
One thing that's fucked up is bad dope that I can't pump
Blend it in with the raw, bubble it fast cop more
What you want nigga? What you want nigga?
Trying to win with the construction Timbs yo
Check, check
Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willie
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
50 Gs to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
At my arraignment screaming
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Baby one day you'll be a star
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Too many ladies give these niggas too many chances
Rocked too many rhymes, cocked too many nines, too
I don't follow any guidelines 'cause too many niggas ride mine
Hah, what the fuck
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Without the eight, right, maybe you could test my weight, right
Feelin' sarcastic, "Look at him, still sleepin'"
You never ready, forever petty minds stay petty
(No doubt, no doubt)
Well, it is definitely the bomb! But you know I do wanna say somethin' to you, I know you've been havin' a lot of problems with the law
Alright
It's called Reasonable Doubt
Her name is Ms Mary J. Blige
(What I'm ready)
I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
I'm one of the best player's that done it
Mary!
(Jay Z baby)
Baby one day you'll be a star
Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I got extensive with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
(Why wouldn't you)
(Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what)
Le Tigre, Pa you're too eager
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a player eating
I'm taking out this time
(Let's take em uptown, let's take em uptown)
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
(We in Harlem now, let's go to the Bronx on em)
If you know the song, sing along
In this dancery
(You love that, ladies and gentlemen Ms Mary J Blige)
Ok, alright. We might be at 8, we close we close. Alright, I got you Mami, let's slow it down one time)
Ohh, uuuuuuahyeah, uuuuuuooooooh
(Jay-Z, ha ha, Meli'sa Morgan)
My name's like a swear
Now y'all can swear to Jay
And the only thing worse than getting old is not getting old
And I, hope you shine
Seen many wrinkles and enough memories to last you two lifetimes
To give you a piece of my mind
Check this
If you skating through the night to the light, then trust something
Love the way you behave and beg
Came back with six bags struggling
Can't knock the hustle for real (ha)
To this rap biz with fake nigs you know liars
Some of them ain't even rapping for chips
Like a rap star in front of the club
('Cause I can't knock the hustle, the hustle)
We about to change this game here
I remain without fear
I'm taking out this time
Moan, turn those hollers to screams as we zone like a college team
Came back with six bags struggling
I don't want no romance, I just want the chance
In this rap biz with fake nigs, you know liars
These rap dudes can flip, but some of them ain't even rapping for chips
What part of the game is this?
Started with four jacks, ended up with Gold Ac's
On the weight of me through you, screw you
But that's my cash, I understand you hustle
Oh oh oh oh
Lustin' for creamin' - bitches with big butts
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
And give ya my love and cry with you
Until I was up to touch the sky
Me and you gettin' busy, slingin' dick in the dirt
See us, tongue-kissin', you was truly with it
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Hah man, you know man, I'm just dealing that hoe money
Uhh, I talk jewels and spit diamonds: all cherry
Caviar and silk dreams, my voice is linen
I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I
You know the black I white china in the brain cabinet
Nah, you know, that's just laid back man
(It don't get no hotter than that baby)
The star player, the golden bar layer
You can be a hairpin off and you can trigger your roots
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh
How could you see the difference between you and I?
'Round friends who kill they friends
Memories may sneak down my cheek
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
In my dreams, in my dreams (Ugh)
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
Hopin' I can touch what I see
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Locked rap for three summers, poker faces with the aces under
Shit knockin', almost a crime, get Cochran
Same goes for lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Delegate this, men just givin' face lifts
Odorless tasteless, cause of death is traceless
I know you wanna see me wasted
Team Roc sweater and ice water
Y'all niggas is local but that's evident
Brought up in the rapture, my flows torture
Known men, home in, all of my homies condone sin
Put a part right through your dome like the Omen, foamin'
*Niggas* is cartoons, picture styles that's fully developed
No *motherfuckers* hope I fail, and gotta provoke the frail
Geah, there you have it
(Sexy, sexy) I know y'all missed the bounce
Where my hustlers, where my boosters at?
I need the space to say whatever I like, now just
Back it on up like a U-Haul truck
He and the boy Phar-real make beautiful music
Ma are you insane? Let's just
(What you want me to do?)
Ha ha! Sexy sexy, ha ha! Sexy sexy
Ha ha!
Let's go to my hotel, cause this don't go well
Or that BBC shit or it's probably tailored
Ha ha! (Your boy is back, uh-huh, uh, uh)
Sigel-Sigel in the house! Uh-huh, sick bastard (Yeah)
Every time you see Jiggaman, I'm rolling on dubs
On the platinum Yamaha, got the engine gunning
Sigel—Desert Eagle, dawg, who else but me?
Roc Airs, Roc-Wears, bandannas and white tees
Bang the Roscoe 'til the sunrise; plus, I stay dumb high
Club shit or drug shit, I pop shit—I got shit
Get a ounce, get a woods, everybody spark to it
Still bust, more or less, still puff, BITCH!
Spray right at your brain; by the way, this is Hov
Sigel lock Philly up, Brooklyn is me
To do it again! (Uh-huh)
I ain't got time to waste (check it)
What you gay? Nigga, Jay straight like Indian hair
And kill the ice grill holmes
We exit stage left, hop in her Lexus
.. may I suggest that it's
A lot of long-legged chicks in short-ass dresses
Go get your dance on, go grind on one
Quick question - yo, why you over here?
My office hours 9 to 5, whyon'tcha call me there
There's so many hoes in here
I understand you got issues but I really don't care
.. go find somethin' to do
You need to, be easy, ahh
Heh, what you need to do, is..

But reach and I bury niggas sixty feet deep

COME AND GET ME!
{*bell rings*} COME AND GET ME! Ka-ka-ka-COME AND GET ME! ..
Heard about the watch, the Bentley hard-top
I can recall a year ago I almost lost this job
The quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats
How y'all gon' stick me up, take my jewels away
Well I got news for y'all fools today, hey..
COME AND GET ME...
Made 'em relate to your struggle, told 'em 'bout your hustle
I expected to hear, "Jay, if it wasn't for you.."

I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME...
Place: Marcy, Brooklyn
He likes the style and profile I think he wanna mock
He likes the way I walk, he see my money talking
I see his hunger pains, I know his blood boils
He wanna run with me, I know this kid'll be loyal
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
In the game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
And chasing crackheads up the block for my pay
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Hahah, I like your style (Nah, I like your style)
Here's a thou', A G? I ride with you for free
I want the long-term riches and bitches
(On the low?) Yeah, the only way to blow
Then you play your cards, then he through dealing I understand
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Uh-huh uh yeah, gi-gi-geyeah
Whole game tighter now
Moving a brick a week
Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out the loop
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Yeah, you done came up (uhh), put your life on the line (uhh)
Oh God, don't let him control y'all
Any nigga trying to harm Jay, I'm feeling for you
Give it a year, you'll be sitting on a million or two
I done came up (came up), put your life on the line (uhh)
Time to change up (change up), no more second in line
Yeah, you done came up, put your life on the line
The next week two O's gone
Coming out ya mouth sideways like some rookie niggas

We could stack dough sky-high
Think you get some dough for my community chest?
Blaow blaow two to yo chest
Ya'll niggas cheap like Baltic Ave
Wanna borrow from the bank, nigga what you think
Peru trip money flew in six money
Taj Mahal trips orange chips money
Long dick money all in yo bitch money
Been OG's for so long
Where I need a turtle-neck to rock my check
And a pair of isotoners to rock my rings
Flip twice rip that crew then I'm droppin my thang
Jay-Z, Rock Jockey, check it:
Cause all that matters is the money
When the beast screams "kill me"
It gets worse - if you don’t care
For my sick thoughts like a nurse
I’m leaving boys and men
The best observe
Used to having a whole lot
So dough - I blow a lot
I was scheming and plotting mostly
Dreaming alive, but look what it got me..
Always keep a smile when they want me to frowns
They found no weapon just only a draw of herbs
It's a new day, hit up KD
Uncle said I'll never sell a million records
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see me again
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
Get y'all to fear me is my only job
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of they history
Don't give a fuck who you are
I makes the whole city hot like fiddy shots at idi-ots
Show him I got more then take the shit he got, Biatch!
My grand stack, hands free and a six; vivid jam-packed
To each his own y'all can eat this chrome
This that futuristic shit, bitch
These cats ain't never touched nothing, ain't never gonna touch nothing
And ain't nothing gon' change that, dead or alive
Any ill feelings I harbor y'all can blame it on the vibe
She told me, "Fight in your afterlife, never revamp your story"
Hollering shit from '89, Hawaiian Sophie
GS the fucks Yukon GMC trucks
Slugs ease the pain to your brain when thugs squeeze
It's murder
Introduction Sauce motherfuckin' crank this shit
Thoughts of hating sober intoxicated minds is taking over
Thoughts that this sport'll feed you
Freeze off my kneecap, can y'all believe that?
Rappers goin' broke tryin' to keep up with me
You know this nigga: Jay-Z, Shawn Carter
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
So sick of niggas
I'm here to tell niggas it ain't all swell
One day you're cruisin' in your 7
'Bout to start bitchin', ain't you?
And now they not sane and not playin', that goes without sayin'
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)
Presidents to represent me (get money!)
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
I saw his life slippin', this is a minor setback
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
I had near brushes, not to mention
Partner, I'm still spendin' money from '88, what?
Presidents to represent me (get money!)
All sneak thieves and player haters can shine
But until then, I keep the trilliant cut diamonds shinin' brilliant
I'll tell you half the story; the rest, you fill it in
I spend Japan yen, attend major events
'Nough dollars make sense, while you ride the bench
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (whose...)
Mic-macheted your flow
Pay 580 for blow, better believe I have 1160 to show
Naked without your gun, we takin' everything you brung
Dead presidentials, politics as usual—BLAOW!
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (whose...)
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (whose...)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!)
Too hot to handle, Too dope to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Diamond in the rough
Welcome to the Compton Zoo, lying with a lion on Rosecrans Avenue
Arms so soar beating up these instrumentals Sounwave give me
More, after that find a morgue with a mortice, because we..
Your seats, we going to Cloud 9 and we
Analogy is like a pit bull on the pulpit, I drool I don't really
Now I'm grown up, unemployed, sipping Henny, pissing throuh a cup, and still get
Or test drive with Kendrick the Jedi, one of a
Baby here's my number
Baby I'm a player, Go and hit me up
Shake shake it up, shake shake it up, shake shake it up
Once the neon light hit the Top Dawg logo
See my, wrists hang out
See my, homies hang out
You know my name baby girl no stranger
So awkward when I park it
If you tryna fuck, baby do your thang
So just chill, grab your bitch because life's too short
Pocket full of dubs
Baby here's my number
Baby I'm a player, Go and hit me up
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
Lucifer was all around
Until I found my safe haven
Making myself realize what my foundation was
On the dead homies
Turn this shit up! Sounwave, turn this shit up nigga
To Pimp a Butterfly, another classic CD
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy
Nigga, we gon' be alright
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Nigga, when our pride was low
Huh? We gon' be alright
I don't think about it, I deposit every little zero
If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
But we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Dark nights in my prayers
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
So I went running for answers
I suggest that you stay in the house at night
No, I'm not Wesley Snipes
Been this way ever since first grade
Forte demeanour was to get paid
Thirteen I was ready for gunplay
I get four shots like a freak oh he know
You want beef with your boy
LAPD they can't stop us
Rockets shoot down helicopters
Pop shots yeah we kill niggas
On the real nigga
Coming with a [?] to grill niggas
Trying to set me up so I gotta think twice
And when I leave I [?] your white carpet got a stain
Watch as my city get gritty
Big k-holes in your dodge you can hear me
Nigga go clip for clip
We let the match ratatat
And all the heads we crack
Tryna cop the gs
Hit him with the 8 better yet with the 4
Ever since a young man (Since a young man)
Look, look… hol' up!
Don’t judge! Don't judge me! Now my home got a Valley peak
Don't judge me! Won't you tell a friend? Y'all gon’ see—
Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Ayy, do you know who you talkin' to?
Slide on you like fallen drapes
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
Everything I say is from an angel
Ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!"
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!"
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
This what God feel like
Ah! Ah!
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
House keeping
No, you ain't shit, you say you love them
I know you don't mean it
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence?
You ain’t no friend
Where was your antennas?
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh
They say if you scared, go to church
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
Roses are red, violets are blue
I remember what you said too, you said
Usually I don’t do this
Lucy give you no worries
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave
I come from another planet, holdin' that cannon
Best believe I will dump 'til all of you vanish
Now you know I go, harder than most
I'm on that pimpin' shit, take your bitch, guard your ho
And I don't give a shit, if I hit, long as she blow
Just as much as a ref does a whistle
Superglue grip, I ain't ever slippin'
She like "Damn, how you do that stuff?"
Oh yeah, I'm what people need
Go DJ, cause that's my, cause that's my, cause that's my
Fuck a pistol, let them niggas feel the K, man
Thinkin' you the shit, face in the toilet
You wanna witness the livest nigga existin'
Then come and pay me a visit, you have to pay for admission
I got the streets in a frenzy, dudes in the streets, they commend me
Don't try to creep, I got semis and best believe they will empty
Mix the juice with the Remy got me feelin' so damn tipsy
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave
This is your station, baby
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
I should ask a choir: "What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
All I see is strobe lights, blindin' me in my hindsight
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
I heard 'em chatter: "He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down
He don't mind, he know we'll never respect
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothin' to lose
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"
Uh, warriors and Conans
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump
That's what momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
Seem like the whole city go against me
"Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Wake yo' punk ass up!
How we do
In fact I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
Loc yeah that's cool
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
And the price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
Compton, U.S.A. made me an angel on angel dust, what
The saga continues
(?)
A new day, we gotta hit the schedule ahead of us
Ghetto zorro on the headlines, i leave
Multiple of it, majority love it
Tried to play it off like the paramedics was coming
It's a new day
Cause (?)
Brings for the new life
Oho you done fucked up baby
S.W.A.T team so aggressive turn a mind up problem ????? extreme coolaid red beam on top of my weapon
New hundred spoke
New six tray
New 2pac
As a new day begins the saga continues
The moral is try your best to not collide with the best of him
New hundred spoke
New six tray
Ahahaha
These motha muckas plottin all kinds of shit behind your back
And I drunk a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you has beens
But now I'm here, GQ, man of the year
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Pardon my residence
As we proceed
But now we have a big whip, parked pon' the block
We gon' be alright
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Tell em' other gangsters silence for the record
We been hurt, down before
When our pride was low
We gon' be alright
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
God
Cut off the engine then sped off in a Wraith
How come I can long time
Puff on what I want
Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God
At the end of Section Park
'Til your son jumps into your arms
The only time I lie in a booth is when I sleep in it
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key
To define the laws of crack
Y'all don't obey, y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
Just inspiration: something you never had
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
Nine or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
But money was barricading my door, I couldn't open it
Money on my passenger side, now who you rolling with?
I hope you got nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
Screaming, "Fuck the world" with a capital F
So have your shit up to par if you rep for the West
So where do I go now
I'm the bishop, I'm the pastor, I'm the god MC
Been hungry, I think a nigga need three stomachs
Every line be tailor made, hella paid, count that money, several ways
Ok, I squeeze the juice out a rapper and just squash this track
The people like "What the fuck happened and where Wayne be at?"
He got it on lock like a Low Jack
Y'all better fall back, y'all better crawl back where ya'll came from
Like a bottle dude, get a hollow, where you swallow food
Get a model, bet she swallow, who? Me
On your side motherfucker, side motherfucker, ride motherfucker, die motherfucker
Open up close shop like a retail spot
Bitch thats no lie, let the truth be told
K Dizzle, the Big Sizzle, turn beats to stoves, burn up
Dig it, like it, love it a lot
Where are you going, we should be growing now
Is just a bed to me
So if my letters don’t reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Now dead to me, gone and forgotten, I’m off track
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Or follow vanity cause that means I’m following evil
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Would you not know how to act or take action?
It’s just a part of life and if your vision’s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight
I got my money right
Land of the scandalous, every corner got a candle lit
Every stop sign got a hollow tip
Tell your boyfriend to do it like this
So, it's only right for your boy to talk shit, yuck
Tell 'em that we chillin' if your boyfriend harassin'
The new West Coast's best-kept secret
Chronic smoke comin' out my throat, ha-ha
Shit, ay, ay, heh-heh, fuck it, I'm goin' in
In a Porsche Box, stashbox, got a new Glock
I'm a run in his house, then ask, "Where the cash, boy?"
You picked a bad time to be at fuckin' home today, stupid
I'm ruthless, I'm Eazy-E, I'm Snoop, shit
Guess who's back? Fresh new fitted, turned back
We'll make your best rapper submit
Your records wax us on and wax you off, ha
We the West Coast classics, you better pay homage
You want problems? The kings of the shoot-outs
Yeah, yeah, aye
They play with the word gangster til some lead dumpin
Until the ambulance coming pressin' on they chest
Everybody extinct, it’s just me and my niggas left
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
And when I say hard body, homie, not in a physical
You either born with it or real niggas around real kids
You ain’t livin' it because you put it in sentences
And you ain’t givin' it if it’s ten percent, it gotta be a hundred
Spray your coupe and leave smoke in it like Chris Tucker
We lift something out the trunk that got a kickstand with it
You either crawl now or get laid down
Think about it, I’m only giving you one minute
You can see the fire burning like my Lamborghini tires
Wear em for a minute, sell them the next week
That’s good profit, y'all ain’t thinkin' logic
Teach you niggas a lesson or two
We Batman and Robin
Gone in my fast car
Circle round the block twice
What we tell 'em? I love you
Just know that they cost 3000
Mother fucker I'm ballin'
No Motherfuck that I'm stallin' on them
But I act a donkey
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
Carry the whole city on my back
And you can get served every day without a in-house maid
Bullets flyin', helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Pac is rapping, Gregory tappin', people singing, bells is ringing
It was eye witnessing poverty
Shower me with the will that never dried
I tell you put your worries and friendly doubts to the side
She’s been miserable, she’s been living in prison
Tell me you’re ready to change
Say, right on time
Functioning addict, I’m high off her passion
Foolish of her to try to play towards my vanity
And this is high stakes I risk it all for a pair of snakes
I never felt more alive than I felt dying
Say, you right on time
I heard you spending all your time baby (Ohhhhhh)
At least a nigga got a dime baby (At least a nigga got it)
Baby my vice, she got me driving with no headlights (Is that right?)
She said I got a plan, got a plan for ya
Tell me you want me to change, hell naw I'm still sippin' the same
Riding around town, big taxi
I’m out in London, please don’t ask me
I don’t know when I’ll be going back to Cali
Said I’m riding around town, big taxi
Out in London, don’t ask me
For the valley girls or them hoochie broads
I don’t know, I don’t like ‘em if you wife ‘em dog
Everybody put three fingers in the air
Stand for something, or die in the morning
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Grown men never should bite their tongue
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
I don't want plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
We been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
Look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers
Those the type of lines that I'm talking 'bout
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
Probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga
Told me "Don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you"
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
I remember you was conflicted
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
And a Comptown fitted
Back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch
I call a bitch a bitch, a hoe a hoe, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
As a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
Wicked as 80 reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
The King of Diamonds with diamonds, I never do ask for it
She callin' the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff him
When you niggas is past poor? You'll never hop in my lane
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
They'll probably think I'm Osama

Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo-
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression

"20 on pump 6," dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, "Beat it"
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?

You woke up in the morning, took a shower

You tried to maneuver all the way to the call box
But what I love most is how you put
Wait!
You know what that means, I'm done with you
Bye!
With a dove skin bitch laying on the side of me
Wow, I'm amazed by how you niggas talk about you're married to the game, ain't took a vow

I could, I could never take the lead, never bob and weave
Negative is lettin' them annihilate me
Money in the ceilin', lay my body in the street
Seen enough, make a everybody scream, "I love myself"
I lost my head
Appetite for the feelin' I can barely describe
I could be your advocate
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
I'm on point like period
The way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
My unborn son and grandson will live royal
Well I've had this world since birth
Feel the good kid's hunger
The Crips made strong, the Pirus made stronger
And if you say it ain't, you may offend me
He stood alone for so long
Prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
The definition what cool is
Uh, I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figured that I hit the NBA and make a fortune
501s, Louis letterman jacket
You know that Compton ghetto shit
But I'm from '87, with a thousand dimes
Fucking all my high school teachers
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
The homies say I'm the truest
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Uh, So give me fifty feet champ
I drop a record then I raise the crime rate
Boy, I thought you knew this

Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it

Bitch, I do this
Fedora on the top, the black Abraham Lincoln
Kama Sutra missionary, fuck shit up on top

Hoes are choosing, niggas' hating, we ain’t tripping, keep our balance
Boy, I thought you knew this
Boy, I thought you knew this
Chucking deuces, then drop one, dropping music and I won
Tables turn, say you earn rights to be the God MC
Boy, I thought you knew this
It's K. Dot, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, I said Philly
Where my gangstas at? Where my dimes at?
9 times out of 10 half of y'all will die in this combat
I'm feeling like Muhammad Ali in his prime
I'm tryna see a better way, I still feel hatred
They just kick down the door as if they have permission
Wish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something
No assumptions, I know I'm nice
That nigga, Colon Powell
I am a senseless thug, with book smarts
We gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession
Exclamation, put it in quotes
The rapper's rapper, the MC's MC
I said cheese
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
Police radio signals saying that a 187 land on your corner
Ask me what I have accomplished
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high
This the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
Until the day I pistol-whip you posers 'til y'all pissed off
Stop it, I'm hearin' the comments
The critics are calling me conscious
Proves... that ignorance is bliss
You a hundred percent behind me
As the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak
Scared of you but I will fight you
You introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers, children and babies drive me crazy I wonder
One of my biggest fears, is waking up 4 in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
You, son of a bitch and I wish you never existed
Let me continue this letter saying I don't like you
And all I say is a prayer, "so help me, Lord!"
Of knowing that you're everlasting
Of the Earth fatal assassins
Sooner or later, I'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
Please take it personal
So don't say I ain't sympathetic
But you can barely get curiosity, I'ma dead it
But I take it out on somebody and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
Signed and sealed by the living
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I'm doing
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (know that)
I was walking from Centennial
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you"
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
So there you have it
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
Uh, when you lookin' at me, uh, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Lift up your head and keep moving (Keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you? (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
How many times my potential was anonymous?
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
Blow steam in the face of the beast
The strong in me, I still smile
(I love myself)
(I love myself)
(Fi-fie-fo-fum, fi-fie-fo-fum)
(My heart undone, my heart undone)
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make everybody scream, "I love myself!"
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh woes keep me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry
In a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Where you at? From the front to the back
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day
It's the immaculate, verbal assassin
No challengers can compete, their childish and weak, detrimental
Gimme a hundred g's, for every emcee I dropped to their knees
"Oh you got the juice!?" I squeeze you juiceless
Been the truth since "Snoop and Tha Pound" was fuckin over Ruthless
Lyrical cyclops, lasering in on paper and fraudulent friends
I swear to God, can ya lyrics in a jar
Explosive, cinematic, smoking
Like the barrel of this TEC aimin at ya neck
At the Avalon's swap meet, "wassup fool!?"
You are counterfeit, worthless piece of verses surf this
Thinking 'bout living without the past and the present
10 minutes exact, letting my mind explore
What if B.I.G. never did it big
But would there be more Bloods than Crips sets
L.A., Orange County, the Valley, and back up to the bay
Imagine if Mike Concepcion walked on his own two
Or would he been lost his life to the streets
What if Freeway Rick never was a kingpin
These rappers ass backwards
Imagine seeing your mom cry, tears of happiness
Knowing her son safe, and she ain't lose him to this madness
She got a fat ass with an amazing mind
Now ain't that true love?
I tell her kill Cupid and give my crew love
Tell 'em you couldn't bury with two cups
Papa need his courage or face eternal extortion
I harbor around the orbit on my Darth Vader
Black ski mask green leaf body bag liquor poured
So much 40 oz poured it's like the curb's made of gold on the ave
That's the mind of state, rap niggas meet your fate
Dave Chapelle these niggas are half baked
I will not let not one MC go to waste
I will not, cannot lose, comfortable at the top
I'm, sub-zero, I put your career on freeze
Delete you like an unwanted movie scene
You're scared ain't ya?
Fucking failure!
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Get it back
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
"Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
He was five foot something, dazed and confused
You can take your boy out the hood
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Advise you to purchase it or copy the worst
I have no sense, ever since the Rodney King riots
The four pound decorate your city
'Til the reaper come get me, follow me now
Under my sheets, no life, thinkin' 'bout death
Plus a cute little casket so your body can sleep
The Hub City shit is me
Love
You're my homie I'm telling you
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
The sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
Down, down valley deep (down, down valley deep)
Fi-fie-fo-fum (fi-fie-fo-fum) (I love myself)
(I love myself)
But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind
I went to war last night
I must've misread what the good book said
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry (i)
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin'
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
All my life I want money and power
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
I've got 25 lighters on my dresser, yessir
And I run at ho with a baton
Killin' everything from pussy to a mothafuckin' Hit-Boy beat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then ball at your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbin' in the street, yellin'—
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
All my life I want money and power
Kendrick have a dream
Sit still, and close your eyes (Smoke to it)
I used to write rhymes, all day and all night
While you were playing PlayStation, my pencil was erasing lines
You killed the nigga, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Give me rings, give me chains, mane
A mansion with marble floors and security codes
Give me fame and fortune, me and Trump on golf courses
And that's love
When love comes calling, don't look back
Now everybody smoke to it, for this is, the celebration
Patron shots I consume taking the pain away
Now I'm just trying to trap cream
So me without one is like I'm dated
Rapper slash athlete, killing these niggas, they're screaming in agony
Half of these niggas ain't half of me
Great Depression, I don't know much, all I know is studio sessions, and how to get my bars up

Dog, I ride with the chrome, gotta be safe in this shit
I don't ride on no skateboard, I roll with some grinders
I was a drug dealer, but now I'm a wild spitter
I can't help it, the hood flow through my blood
This gangbangin shit, should be considered a drug
Everybody doing it now, I see you rap niggas
Everyday is a lesson, well I get kicked out, shit got me guessing
Two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
A week before I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that I hit my woman, she hit the floor
Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy
I came to grips, jumped up, and looked out the window
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why
Cause I need You
But it's all to soothe the pain from this
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow
I feel You're there
It was the next morning
My shit is so sweet, candy flavored, no you're not
Skeletons in my closet
And no, you can't get up off it
Halloween, better come with me, I'm sweet
I don't want that to happen, cuz if so I might just start rapping
Kim Kardashian, Wiz did that ass in
Matter fact, this the perfect part to talk about them Lakers

Then seven cars start honking
She give it all to her daddy but she don't know her father
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen the El Camino parked
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
Undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
What's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
I seen the El Camino park
No more K. Dot, my mother had named me Kendrick
Weighing my options, pick up a Bible or a strap?
I never killed a man, never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
I look the Devil in the eye and tell him, "Hell no"
Well, I want the world, tell me how long that takes
Whatever that my pops said, for sure I'd listen
You said you did dirt, but I can't dig it
Oh-no-oh-oh
And if you ain't trying to win, then why try?
Now you can low-ball or give me high five
I be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience
Y'all be out partying, I be stealing your audience
Andando como se fosse o presente de Deus para a terra, mano, você não é merda nenhuma
Você sequer compra pra mim uma roupa pro dia quatro de julho
Eu preciso daquela Brazilian Wavy de 28 polegadas, você está brincando
Você é um negro "sem marca", todo mundo sabe disso
Meu outro mano está ligado, você está desligado
Que porra que está pegando?
We are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar is explaining to me what happened to him yesterday, when he vanished. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.
I asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. "Pretty cool." Shrugs. "And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't."
A month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the "Control" thing: "You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'—pretending like nothing ever happened." Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped "Control" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.
When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.
Much of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos—some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton—and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. "When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets—nobody never really knows," he says. "But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman."
Twenty minutes later, Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. "You guys seem so calm," I said.
Every part of me says go ahead
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
And we'll be screamin' out no rules, no rules
Look around me and you'll see the scene, who to blame?
See my generation has no shame, I play the game
How I see it this is inside the future, this is nothin' that you're used to
Out your power position, my army head-on collision
Every time that I zone in, nothing is more convincin'
Every part of me says go ahead
This is me changing faces cause I can stand alone and die alone as long as I got pride
The truth will set you free and to me that's the only reason, capisce?
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
It feels
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires

Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?

Looking for a victim of an AK-47 100-round each, each, each
Sometimes gotta
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Be different, do different things
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking liar
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
Momma said, "According to get everything...
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
I miss your call four time this evening for the lack of better words
Had a nickel every time you get a lack of better words
I wish a nigga would (ah!)
God damn, bitch, hoe, huh
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
Let me tell you when it all started
A lot of Biggie comparisons, we all was aware of them
And his brother designed, put together the music
Saying that Game was his partner, so I gave him my tape
But I didn't have a home yet, Hootie had ? in me
But we got over that, heard the beat, wrote a rap
He got signed months later, Warner Brothers
What the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up
It was a hit
When I heard it
Rock jump on it for certain, it was to smash
Shit went sour after Jay-Z left but they didn't care
See I was young, fast forward, hot dollah had the streets on lock
And all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2Eleven too
That part I'mma leave out
Bishop win that game, then had a fight with X.O
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official
The nigga finally told me what he said
That's the only way I know
Draped in some fly shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
And California on that jerk shit
Jill Scott on my iPod, as my head rests
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
And yeah I know I'm from Compton, Cali
But I don't lace up Chucks or rock tan khakis
I probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
Ha ha ha, I like to joke, got a sense of humor?
You ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
But my character never could be like them, man
And they respect that, say that I'm real man
Had to look through a photobook to remember me
Lying to yourself, all over an image
Quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
The reason why they hate, is cause these motherfuckers ain't me
See I give you my life, to mix it up in a blender
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
Kendrick Lamar, What are you trying to say?
I just wanna be higher than that
Trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
That means I'll be frontin'
22, like the smallest of guns that you know
Most determined, but with the smallest of funds to show
The negative you bring, the stress, the violence
That means I wanna be the highest
Uh
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
More gangster under the family tree, took 'em under his wings like KFC
When black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough
No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
Hahahaha
LMAO
All cause I'm 21
I'm that cool
Plus I'm bouncing through the club
Ziploc fresh
What more can I say say?
Like a third graders tooth
Park that Lambi' outside
Just to fuck with the haters
Put the Lami' in drive
Watch 'em peel like potatoes
Holla' LMAO
When they drunk and two-step
Providing lenses
I'm out of this world
But my floor is marble
In the back of that chrome
See they're all I need
I pop more than I pop for when the cop blow
You Fruity Pebble, homosexual wearing velcro
Mistaking me for a real thug, this is not a game
Though it's not here yet, you motherfuckers still know who's best
Killer Cali niggas don't know how to act and I
By the way you carry yourself
It's like that and like this and like that and a
Killer Cali niggas don't know how to act and I
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, bang
Got a problem then I'm hopping at your team
Niggas cicadas, with their little babies walking with guns
Better step your game up before it's over
Sulken red, fall on the ground, you know he dead
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Washed up, bang, bang, you know what's good, bang, bang
You an amateur, they wanna pro to call
Like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
Shoved off the porch when I was like six
Cause I’m going out with a fist raised
Mark of the beast wear your god damn bar-code
Stuck in the street where it's dark like Harpo
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight back and shit
You trying real hard to appeal to someone
I’m being myself, my BFF is a BM-dub
I bet I finish on a level with a Black belt
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
And it's all for the hideous
The nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh
I ain't afraid to say I need you, ah yeah (Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
I write for sure, my folks unite
Boldest lines in rhymes and things
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The roads that show just what it mean
Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders
(Wooh!)
'Cause I done bodied the game to the point
I spit the saliva, that's leaking the lava
Graffiti your arm up, you heebee, you jeebee
You treat me, you greet me, you meet me with arms up
Spit bars to provoke your mental
(Wooh!)
Don't you know, baby? (Ooh, woah)
Whenever you need me (When you need me)
Whenever you need me (Whenever you need me)
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
(Why'd you pull the devil even closer?)
(Wooh!)
Don't you know, baby?
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Damn, love or lust
(Another world premiere)
Sippin' bubbly, feelin’ lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
I wanna be with you
I know what you need
All feeling go out, this feeling don't drought
This party won't end
If I minimized my net-worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a whole one hund', don't got you, I got nothin' (Uh, uh)
I wanna be with you, ayy, I wanna be with
Just love me, just love me, just love
I don't wan' pressure you none
Oh, by the way, open the door by the way
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
Look what you made
I'm like a exit away, yep
I gotta ball for my dead homies
You forever hold it down
In love and memory, no enemy could separate us
I love it even if I get no bigger
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Pushing foreigns, flying cars
Bring back Derek, Stunna Deuce
Sunday school wasn't cool, let's be getting at bitches
When I'm on these beats
Chad, I promise I'll be back
I'm saying
I'm laughing, I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
(Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
Ba-Ba, bow-bow)
All we got is us
My resume is real enough for two millenniums
I'm hangin' on the fence again
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I’m established, hundred carats on my name
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain’t no other love like the one I know
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up (Fired, fire)
All I want is, all I want is
10-4, no switchin' sides
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
10-4, no switchin' sides
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
Lord knows I'm dyin', baby
Right after my admission inside the game, asked him bout whats his name
Music award [?] for all of the nominee
I was promised to win, he was promised to leave
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Am I askin' too much? Let me put the head in
Well I, I never expected
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Or maybe some kicks and make you—
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl, I respect the cat
If it's okay, she said, "It's okay"
I wake in the mornin', my head spinnin' from the last night
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Time passin', things change
Lust turn into fear
I need some water, somethin' came over me
Am I askin' too much? Let me put the head in
You have thought it was tender me on point like a widow P
Got that leverly give them dearies that do what it do
But you got shot by the driver
This is spoken wisdom as I journey a poe and mission
Low the bisquits let's go to distance

Pack a van with four guns at a time
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all—duck!"
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
In fact, I got fired, 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
Kendrick a.k.a. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real, yeah
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Niggas always actin' unsensitive and shit
One time
And life's a bitch, don't hit women, so I bit her
Fucking up my prestige, 'til I live with the blues
Through the barbed wire
Tryna get away from the world's stereotype
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
Celebrate the very day that she get past
We are, we are (true)
Through the, through barbed (wires)
Living off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian
Making good decisions, got a independent business-mind
And if you say they can't live comfortable
Flow sicker than cancer in Manchester
I make it hot
I go from Compton to Watts to the suburb-ian-ghettos
Tryna battle
You can't see me
Yo, yo
Anybody wanna see God(?)-bless ya
I gotta get paid, I gotta get laid
Bite the sound, I just came and blazed
Blewell jeans, Moby Dick stitching
Shit, I'm back in the front
Where ya safe at?
And catch it all like an umpire
And never question my shit again ho
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
This is HiiiPower, since the Eddie Bauer I been popular
Skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em? You should learn from 'em
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Man, the game chose me, what am I to do?
Out there on my bumper like a city cop
You fuck niggas, you pussies crazy
But I know I can tell you about your girl homie
But I make that pussy pay me
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m three much for these hoes, Wayne told me that…
I remember tripping, walking through the set
Your broad done chose, guess she moving on, yep, we do it wrong
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
Head in the clouds but my vision alright
Just like I'm Kanye, they think I’m insane
How can I handle the faith and the fame
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Within two bars, you already said I'm hot
They savor, my fruits of labor
To go against me you gotta be more than professional
You got to go extra hard like an erection with no protection
And I be fucking all these bars
Take this and take that from the machine
Got this money up, with no caffeine
Apple software got the next 10 years scared I'm Fred Krueger
Leave them dead inside the sewers
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
Look I act a ass, but I'm not jack
You can't make that ass sit or flip-flop back
I'm too gutta nigga top that
With 45 goons 45 shugs
Chase your ass upstairs throw you of your roof
I see you big dogs, all I hear is woof
I just might...
...Snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite
Like a Chevy in quicksand
Black Pendleton ball cap (West, west, west)
Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
We been waitin' for you
I know everything
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
He looked at me and said, "Kendrick, you do know my language
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Tell me something, got me losing my mind, ah!
Jump, jump, jump, jump
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (Ya bish)
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (Ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish)
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
Bump that new E-40 after school (Way after school)
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (My homies)
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (A pot of gold)
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Imagine Rock up in them projects
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
If they do, tell the truth
But it's all good
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
K’s Mom: See, he high as hell. Shit, and he ain’t even trippin' off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back!
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on ("Let Burn" came on)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (ya bish)
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
Bump that new E-40 after school (way after school)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish)
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold)
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
That's just how I feel
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
But for now I guess this sack will do (this sack will do)
They told 'em money the root of all evil (that's all evil)
He hugged the devil the moment he seen 'em
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (ya bish)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (tell my bros)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (ya bish)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (ya bish)
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish)
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Even if it's doing crime ya bish (ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do)
And I been hustlin' all day
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
Make sure that you don’t bring ya man to my concert
Nigga, I’m Compton
Often reminisce about the old days, Hardaway/Alonzo
Artist you a novice I’m recording on a spaceship
Closeminded niggas getting clotheslined, I suppose
Got the keys to her pad like I’m bout' to type and shitt
Nigga, I’m Compton
I'm convinced we already in hell, pass the blunt devil
If you walk with a mac truck, then throw a bus on your ass!
Fuck you and fuck you fuck niggas
Ain’t not countdown fuck with us
And your bitch be my promo
They be like oh no wait, he’s bout' to take the whole cake
Nigga we made men and cavemen, living in the stone age
Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today… Today…
I feel like
Bumping some shawty
Rollin my window down and hitting the highway
No its not Friday
Thinking that my music don’t stick like some nunchucks
I’m not boastin' or braggin' not a person I’m a dragon
I’m so high off life that I can OD
So to speak you niggas not within arm reach
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today
Fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
Fuck your love fuck your hate fuck your snitchin'
Whether you fuck with me or not
Fuck keepin' it real
I'm a keep it K-dot
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
Today… Today… Today…Today… Today… Today…Today… Today… Today…
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, how much are you dependent?
Revenge on your mind when it’s mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
That’s not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
"I remember you was conflicted
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?
Do you see yourself as somebody that’s rich
I changed everything, I realized my destiny
I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people
I made millions for these movie companies
And through your different avenues of success
And it was happening to me for a reason
So it’s no problem, you know
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I’ve ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it’s been met with resistance
And I wanna lay it all down"
There’s nothing but turmoil goin’ on so, I wanted to ask you
I think America think we was just playing
And it’s gonna be some more playing but
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
Describing my world, it says:
While consuming its environment
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city
Which institutionalizes him
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as
The result?
They are one and the same"
Gettin' my career right
As I should
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
Bubble kush in the trunk, choppers in the front seat
So high off life, that bitch I could OD
Die twice, and come back the same nigga
I'm high king behind black tint
I'm in the studio
Gettin' my career right
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Flyer than first-class and detention
And my records show, not even in the Guinness
Open for criticism, there really isn't any room for criticism
Cookin up the flow
As I should
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
No matter the cost
They say, "Who fucking with you if you the god MC?"
I ain't got to study law
All day all night
Cookin up the flow
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
The cliff of the unknown
I said my name is Kendrick, Lamar
Fuck a stage name
The only thing that I can identify with in this business
Weighing my options pick up a bible or strap
I'm tryna find some dreams y'all want me to follow trends
Why we kill our brothers, why we hurt our mothers?
We should stick together because we're all we got
We all we got
Bullet penetrated his leg, femur bone
Niggas would rather steal than think of a righteous plan
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we
Still you don't compliment, inconsiderate black pride
My people don't love me
Martin and Malcolm them dudes paved the way
The shit need to stop today
To become better people, think about it
But now we running from our brothers that be holding them k's
Let's leave this bullshit behind y'all
On the real, the envy and the hate need to stop
My people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
We all we got man
We all we got
We just hold up our guns like championship cigars
Mama hold the porch sipping OE out of a straw
I remember it all, them early Compton days
If you're shot in the heart bleeding
Ouch
Before that warm temperature warmin' up
I'm the future of the new west for you visitors
Never mind them other niggas
I'm talkin' in particular
I'm igloo cold with it
And you don't look like a zombie and I don't see no cells
I sink niggas blackships, he won't sail
And I had that mind state since twelve
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my A/C
I push the coupe like a high speed
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, modern day Issac Hayes
Study my craft, you ignorant, I do it without a pen and pad
About crack, but never been about that
I'm real with this rap, I'm just speaking the facts
So gather your whole pack, I'm taking them off the map
Easy shit be hard to do, easy for me and hard for you
Try studying a few greats then maybe you'll be where i'm at
Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtapes mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, you're not switching the flow
You've feared your whole life, no TV show
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Uhh, and that's scary to me
Nigga cue me in I'm a Peruvian drug lord
This is crack co-caine, I'm Kurt Co-bain
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack— STOP
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
You pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
Z's on K.Dot? Uh-uh better wake up
Curl up like Big Worm when I drop
That's Pookie on New Jack head first with a cyclops
Guess I'm the blood sacrifice of the party
So my bad if I put you in rehab
Aw dude, you're about to fuckin' OD bro
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
Of prettiness, the wittiness, of colors on her skin tone
I love your smile, you can do it without style
It's the beauty in her but when the make-up occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
I feel like it's not enough
Is that I had a black ey- To be continued... 11
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
I love the way you put it on your eyes
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
No make-up today, no make-up today
Said I'm a fuckin' monster
Popped 'em all, then popped in the jaw of Tracy Veronica
Just might stumble upon a pack of lions
Or your livin' debt y'all soft as a giga-pet
My flow got the ceiling wet, I spit 'til I feel my breath
Who sinkin' my fuckin' chest? She fuckin' the fuckin' best
Where they at I will dissect them like a fucking frog rectum
Why you wreckin' with irreputable my worst flow incredible
Bitch I been doin' before you niggas ruined it
Pay cash when your chain come up missin'
Target flowed I'm somewhere blowed
Cheerin' for the ragin' beats
I was learnin' getting knowledge
Proposition, gettin' money
Drop a nigga, rush a nigga
Bada bing by the ding a ling
Feed the weak that's Wing Stop
HiiiPoWer see our patent, huh?
Y'all ain't nice nigga, y'all just okay
Study my craft, you ignorant?, I can do it without a pen and a pad
It's inspiration, something y'all have never had
If my pockets is something  you're trying to grab, see I pull out a rocket and peel you back like scab, you old news
Do we really fuck with president Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Money in front of me I couldn't open the door
I'm so far ahead of my time I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
Where the true artists at?, if it ain't a good picture you draw don't bring it to the architect
Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtape is mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, you're not
Don't compare me with them, that's like Jaws vs. Nemo
A gorilla to a chimp, Jordan vs. Kukoc
Before I commit suicide
Walk up on 'em, circle the block
Guns drawn, bang! Motherfucker, bang!
Head doctor, knee pads
Curtains close on that Maybach
Street catered, for been living on minimum wages
I wrap rappers on stretchers
I love breakfast, lunch and dinner
Doing numbers like an accountant
You wonder like knife, how much money I'm counting
Verbal mass destruction, you want it? Then call me
Yeah, right. This motherfucker.
I hear you.
Man, Malcolm, shut the fuck up. We gon' go in here, get the money, get out. Simple as that.
What the fuck, man?
People can get murdered. Yeah. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah. What? What? What? What? Pull him up. Uh. We 'bout to murder this shit.  Murder this. Murder that. Yeah. Murder that and this. Ha, we killin' this bitch. We killin' this bitch. We killin' it. Get the fuck up. Get your standin' on, niggas. It's a stand-on, motherfucker. Y'all ain't seen no shit like this.
I got these cops runnin' up on me 'cause I hit the back of the goddamn cop car. It wasn't my fault. I'm all ready to kick it with K-Dot and them tenders, man, and these cops sweatin' me about hittin' the ass of the car, goddamnit. I told them I hit the ass. I don't give a fuck if it's a fly.
This is a special award because of rap music. This is the thing that got me on the stage. This got me to tour all around the world, support my family and all that. Most importantly it showed me a true definition of what being an artist was.
Weezy wassup with it bruddah?
Hear me?
.38 Special, grab it, let him have it, where the safe, we hungry
Where the killers posted on the corner like a letter stamp
I put my hand on the bible
Swear to god if I lie, then I'll probably die tomorrow
I'm right here, I ain't running even if the Iraqis w-was in back of me
Back against the wall I'm clapping them rapidly y'all
Wonder if you can understand or withstand the blast of my wrath
Starving every day, see my face where the bowl is
Bowl on my face, I walk while my mouth hold it
21 gun salute
Cut 'em up in 7 ways, funeral carried by 6 in 5 days you'll know I go for
For a piracy of the streets and my Odyssey
Because my cousin's cuzzin a Blood
Good Kid
M.A.A.D City
Thinkin' about the good times before she met Jay
You was like "no no no," I was like 12 years old
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
She tell me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect
I said "So? I'm only 500 mill away, theres still hope!"
And I didn't laugh when you busted your ass on the stage
I would've stole the award just to prove that I love you
Now I tell everybody Nas had killed him on "ether"
See ya know
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
Hopefully I still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
And push him into a dancer, hopefully they lock lips
So this marriage is over with
But if I end up with Macy Gray, this plan never work
Make the Ruler's apologize you ain't ruling the shit
Dick bitch tight the movie and slanted eyes that squinch
No condom, it's good pussy
Corn bread to break under pressure if he's caught up
Back against the wall closer my back came back with them back pains, whoa
You playa's not allowed I'm sparking your game towels
I move the crowd like Artest and them
It's gotta be a sin. Hm. so Lord forgive me I'm a sinner
I show fools I'm nasty like tofu I wish a
Motherfucker would get your whole career injured
Last month I've been six hours inside of session
Alright
And you don't stop, and it don't stop
This be that shit that make real niggas grab they dick
Two door Regals, El Caminos, and two more
Trace your..with no the ..coach
Ladies press down I bet you dog watchin, west coast what's up?
Gangsta, gangsta you don't stop
And you don't, and you don't and you don't
Jay Rock, SchoolBoy, Top Dog Entertainment
Who can blame me
This is freestyle of the top of the dome
And you know Big Boi that's my home
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
Hopped out the gas station, a homeless man with 100 grand
He begged and pleaded
Tell me how much how much a dollar costs?
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
They wanna know the question
K.Dot, everybody stressin'
This a freestyle off the top of the dome
Big Boy city, you know my home
You can't see us, it's TDE
Because you don't deserve it if you don't not
Please consider that the best agree
The top number one emcee
You thought it was taming me, on point like a widow's peak
They say the number one emcee, best believe
Because you will get disabled
From best of flows I know, you hate it
But anyway I need y'all to flip the beat
Because my words always compete with the best
Boy, we run rap, boy, this is Top Dawg
But this ain't no strong arm, buddy, this just a freestyle
Off top of the brain, boy, you know I get wild
From the bottom of the soil since Adidas and Run DMC
Deep cover on the incognito tip
They say that he writing my bars, forget it
I've been writing for Kendrick for a long time
From a little dude, I said "yes, yes, y'all"
I said "slow down a little bit, bro"
But this the way I wanna instill you
First off let me write what you gon' say
So he just sat in class
He was looking at me, said "do I get a pass?
Then all of a sudden he came to me
Don't stop right there because I think [?]"
When the dude is coming with a contract
But I said "hold on, let me look at that"
I said "okay, he want this, he wants these points
You my lil partna, how old are you on the scene?"
I said okay keep going, and then all of a sudden
So then I came back and he was still in class
I said TDE, the real Macoy
Can't forget Jay Rock, can't forget Schoolboy
And so I put the whole crew together, but from the background
Uh, I see everybody wanna play gansta now, huh
You gotta respect it
See me other than him might plead the fifth amendment
Hard headed nigga shit all it take is an instant
Say you bust your gun, but never totin' it
You say your man is dope I think he's smoking it homie
But you can call me a fly cause your boy be on some shit
Pussy fly so all the girlies think I'm the shit
I've got it to spend but still never buy them shit
You better guard your bitch
Something like a lightswitch
I be God damned
Own 76′s like a Philadelphian
And the shots start coming
It's real
See me in the streets man
It's real nigga
You gotta respect it
It's real
Still affiliated
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
It's fire in the street, fire in my Swisher
I've never seen a crop circle
Can you hear these screams?
Three four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
Lord forbid, the homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
In a system meant to disintegrate us (Ooh!)
Who didn't play games like children?
And on another note
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Ready to go, ready to go
I wrote this because I was ordered to
For instance:
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
You know what all the things have in common?
Know they can't control us
You will leave knowing that you represent something that's bigger than all of us
This is me
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
I can feel your energy from two planets away
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
I can feel the changes
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
You can see that my city found me
I got my drink, I got my music
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
And not compromise the feeling we love
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
Rather a seasonal name
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
With all disrespect, let me say this
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Sometimes I need to be alone
I got my drink, I got my music
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
I can admit that it did look like yours
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
Sometimes I need to be alone
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
I'll take your girlfriend and put that -sy on a pedestal
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
I say Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
Look inside of my soul
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
You don't know what pain is
Another mistake living deep in my heart
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
I can feel the changes
You can see that my city found me
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I would share it but today I'm yelling
You're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm looking right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you living behind the mirror
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
I'm a break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
I am a sinner who’s probably gonna sin again
Things I don’t understand
I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you to me is painless
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know this is something you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
I'mma break out and then hide every lock
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
Bitch don’t kill my vibe, bitch don’t kill my vibe
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
You look at my hat and see thorns there
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Things I don't understand
I got my drink, I got my music
Up in the clouds, me and my spouse
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank
I've been in my wave like 20 years straight
An still be straight (still be straight)
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral
I ministered this generation by far
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
That I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen
Cardio lap, was running for dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
So many washed up with detergent
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Bitch I'm in the club, with the homies, tell me what's good
Okay what these niggas hollin' bout catastrophic K-Dot
Talk that shit potty mouth, Walk that shit pep stroke
Bitch I'm in the club, homies blowin indo
Beyonce, 2 Halle's and 3 Keyshia Cole's
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
Making my conscience ask me
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
Actually making it possible to swim
Graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
That we was just moving backwards
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Now watch that black boy fly
Black boy...
A Buick had driven past bumping him when I mowed the lawn
Compton made you believe success wasn't real
Be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
(Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly)
What this about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it’s both and I got large amounts of it, it’s real
Run for cover, my lineage prove itself
I'm laced nowadays, my gun is off the waist nowadays
I’m in the White House going all out
I merge jazz fusion with the trap music
I mix black soul with some rock and roll
They never box me in, I’m David Blaine-ing all you hoes
Oh yea, let’s go there, my DNA is DMT, I’m so rare
My Juvenile was wilder than the Nolia
Runnin’ this shit with four pair, son of my bitch, I might demolish
To the grave I deport them, corporations extort them
I’m snapping off my endorphins, I alien mighty morphin’
My radiance rather gorgeous, hundred bill to the doorman
So pay the man for performance, saucy all of my garments
The story of your life here
Hoochie, coochie, pussies in a trance
And casualties all around me, don’t make me do demonstrations
Adjourning my power patience and earning royalty payments
The ruckus had been my favorite, King Kunta the fuckin’ greatest
(Why I go easy?)
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King's vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick, all hail the king!
Are you a activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you a king or you jokin'? Are you a king or you posin'?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
KING! KING! KING! KING! KING!
Been ready
HOV, I been ready
Cuz' I ain't gotta think with a light bulb on
And that was before
He don't wear the same clothes as ya'll
Every time I take off
Pandemonium when I take off
You made my record sales come up short
My reply is that it ain't my fault
Blame God
I know that patience is virtue
Bulletproof under that black tent, you can't shoot through shit
I'm bein myself
Momma gon' clean or fix it
All it need is a little season on
Blame God
Uh-uh, fuck that (fuck that)
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
And you feel like no one can relate
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
When the Nuvo start to drown her body and I know
She looked at me, then looked at it
Because we born in the '80s, that A.D.H.D crazy."
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Whoa, whoa-whoa
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
You've lost… your life."
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it
I'm the best in LA. In LA
It's all copastetic. Hip-hop no longer face Armageddon
Oh my god I am the best rapper under 25 you can underline it
Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley whole career on the bench
Which means consecutive championships
Weight on my shoulder, refrigerator Perry
T Owens with Jeff Garcia throwing the pigskin
Maneuver like Warrick Dunn
I'm just having a little fun have some with me
I’m a star kicking niggas off the field and court man
Or knock it out the stadium, hey wait a min
You might say… ouch
Just let me score one time
I’d be going for a week bet they gon’ miss me more than a pitch from Nolan Ryan
After this you gon applaud him
If not, fuck it I’m blood sportin'
Homie I’m blood sport…
This what kings do, talk paper and skate
This what kings do, throw family first, it's real
This what kings do, thinkin' about flying the [?] up
This what kings do, rake down plans with speeches
This what kings do, make sure mama is right, yup
Whether you selling buttons or select pies
We all pharaohs in Camaros flexin' S5's (Uhuh)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, ayo
Ya-yah, ya-yah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
This what kings do, throw family first it's real
This what kings do, make sure mamma is right, yup
This how a king move
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
That's exactly what this sound like
Get some ambition, why you bored?
Niggas like the gossip, like bitches
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
(Industry of counterfeits) I can't fuck with y'all
And I enclosed it with a kiss (a kiss)
Get it on time
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
K-Dot, I'm claustrophobic don't put me in the box with you niggas
Step your game up
I take 99.9% of your fans
Put a bullet in you, tell a doctor get it up out you
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running
Do 'em like Paul Bunyan, axe about him
I'm talking 'bout gold bullets and black suits
And I'm just like spitting cousin, ciao
Y'all don't hear me
I'm just chasing my death
The application of your knowledge is me
For trying to test my patience like nurses
Put your brain on your lady's purses, you niggas crazy
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I tell you that I'm one up
It took me too many moons to fuck up this new platoon
They call me said I gotta crawl before I walk
Like I'm Derrick Rose
I move the crowd like Artest and them
They hear it, you need clearance from the label just to spin
Get your whole career injured
She call my dick antidepressant
None of you niggas stressing
Picking popping
Until they fingers monkey wrenched
You monkeys never make no sense
Cooperate, go home and seen they daughters copulate
Rip out your culo, then kudos
K. Dot
...wonder if there's only a frame
Darling, just take it slow
For you…
Hey, whats up doc?
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic
This shit make a nigga just wanna write
And that's a covenant I put on every tribe
Bet I put some new tires on a lightning bolt
Living in the bottom of the food chain
A new name, want stripes, and you a zebra look-alike
Hope another homicide don't numb you a nun do
That's a error, you can smell it in the air
And everybody really doomed
That's why I'm backdooring you motherfuckas
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
Let my life loose in this booth
Even with a pot to piss in
Discounts never did amount to a check
Drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
Emerging on everbody corner (Dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag
With a task of a new (Task force)
Everybody wanna know my life
I've been running this shit since I (Asked for)
To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
Friends, enemies all the same
Yeah, this me, no mic
Just another player with lots of game
For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
No really this a Sounwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it
When you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
Matter fact where my niggas at?
I'm on one, I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good kid, mad city evil in my heart
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate
I put on repeat Kanye's "Touch the Sky"
But I'll be looking past that I'm tryna touch God
In 2010, I'm tryna ball, nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
That's a quote from Ab-Soul
I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
Searching seven continents accomplishing big shit
I ain't tripping I'm just tipping on fo-fo's
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
I don't care me and Quik went to the same school
Like a self made nigga, I don't need a maid, nigga
They can make me much bigger
I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
To put ya'll in time out, it's time to unveil the real
And your career is about as frail as Ms. Winehouse
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
I gotta stare, I mean wow
A one-on-one, you must have won
Living in the city of the unknown
I show her off, I stunt with her
You gotta be an Odyssey from heaven and above
The way she talk dirty he done threw me the ass
Like a quarterback Mr. McNabb
She introduce me to her friend Teairra Mari
Well, see Mari put a nigga to sleep
I came faster than a NASCAR spinning backwards
In the back of my bucket wasn't using no mattress
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I'ma sit back, take it for what it's worth
I'll give you a job, since 106 didn't work
Out
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
Ciara gave a nigga the goodies love tonight
Like a Voltron, I couldn't keep my pants up
Saying "this just one thing"
Remember that time at your house
Remember when Nelly was downstairs
We all had a good time
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
Oh, ho ho ho, ho ho ho
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Kızlar ve erkekler ile takılıyoruz ve kafamız iyi
İstediğimiz tek şey iyi zaman geçirmek
Dua et ki 21'imize ulaşalım
İstediğimiz tek şey iyi zaman geçirmek
Her şeyi kindar bir şekilde yapmayı öğrenmiş genç adam
Kızlar ve erkekler ile takılıyoruz ve kafamız iyi
In time you'll learn this is about you
But the belligerent kids that we living with
Two time, baby tell me ya love me
Cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
Cause I know she's unfaithful
Selfish as I wanna be and every time you under me
Now, that's the ultimate high
Cause I been drinking too much, thinking too much
We ain't been keeping in touch
Lord forgive me for my sins
She said I found the root of all evil
And every time I'm under you, me too
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Two time, baby tell me ya love me
Look at all the bullshit I been through
Momma take this mothafuckin' block off
Never get through, and I go through withdrawals
Ask you if you give me your rent for
K. Dot wrote me saying Marcus got killed
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
That's on the date the day I take the block off
Pulled up, and they put me in them cop cars
I was racing, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the very day I won
God's will, say a prayer for me mama
Dante, if I stress to take the block off
Who is your protection? G-O-D
No, it's not neglect-ion, I have just accepted
'Member all the nights that I cried
Men lie, wo—women lie
Pourin' halos over haters, killin' insecure niggas
Old BIG, new Pac, oh my God, he's alive, he raps
Bombs on your intellect
Then I'ma buss a nut, yeah I [?] my fuckin' nut
That is not an Escalade, that's a damn armor truck
Might be [?] in Houston
And I know black choppers on the rooftop
Say she wanna clean my dirty laundry
I got this, jumpin' like a kangaroo
My life is, filled with excitin'
Sneak (dissin')
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with...
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
(Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving thy
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
I ain’t talkin' Jay, I ain’t talkin' Bey
Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don’t play fair, should I get out the car?
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
Still I'm laughing at the critics talking, I can see 'em gagging
It's the murder cap' and I'm captain at birthing this gangsta rap
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans nigga
Know that's just how Compton roll
And that's a given
I must report that we import the narcotics you bought it
Then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
Perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in
So tell that gangster throw his set high
Flying back to my city cuz I'll forever standby
Now we can all celebrate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
That know where you stay
I make 'em holla"
Just Blaze
Gimme that '94 Puff shit, Ali
Mos Def, word to every autopsy
But really I'm just as rude as Marshall Mathers
Of course that's a contradiction, the fuck you think life is?
I looked in the mirror and said I can't be like y'all
And the powder and the shells come up off that gun
'quivalent crimes for jail sentencin'
No one preventin' this war
Sure as the edges on every ocean, now let's explore
This is very extra necessary
Reg call 'em Jabberjaw, she gon' hop skip and jog
Just to read my twitter blog
And to you bloggers that say I'm weak
Y'all don't 'preciate shit
Get the water boiling and just uh get a jar or something like that
Lemme put my gloves on
If you wanna learn how to cook in the dope business
Look for the priciest chickens
I recommend that you pay
17.5 no
Drop four grand
But homie if it ain't
That's a whole other story though
250 grams of coke, 150 grams of soda
Until it starts to harden, slowing down the pace
The work should rise to the top
As soon as the razor hit the work, you're happy
How ironic...hmm
You're too professional with it man
Uh, oh, y'all know what it is
Hood advice, (let's go)
To fuck with mine
We live righteously, we can give a fuck about your opinion
Where Eazy was pitchin', Dre was 6'4 lifting
I'm tryin to tell you about
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
A young gun but not like your young Chris and Neef
But when you see ‘em please be quick on your feet
You could contain ‘em
But there's no way that you can stop ‘em
The same time, hope the system don't lock ‘em
From Rosecrans to Central, Compton Centennial
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Had your door in the morning wake you up like roosters
A nightmare on my street, Fred Krueger where I live
Even adolenscence will shoot you over that paper
We get +Vapors+ like Biz Markie but still I'm used to
From Rose crest to central, Compton's Anthemia
We back that's for my people it's official
Me, I'm from the Hub City, yeah, that Compton court building
Five dollar Little Caesar, momma shopped at Food-4-Less
Hood on every corner, stop for gas and get your brains blown
Rest in peace 4 Bent, rest in peace Mausberg
Though I know it's chaos, forever my heart will live in
Where dreams are made of
Compton, Compton
(Verse 2)
Take you back to Y.E.T it was just divining me
Pull me over just to plant an 8 ball on me
Fuck it though I'm out here, I've always been out here
Cali Love video he said whattup I said yeah
Eazy paved the way, Lil Eazy bout to get it in for..
Word to the county building forever I do it for...
(Chorus)
That pussy got a spell on me
Walk around with these
Make
That pussy got a spell on me
I am your neighbor (I am your neighbor)
And I’d like to welcome you to good kid, m.A.A.d city (good kid, m.A.A.d city)
So grab your cartoons and cereal (And sing)
Sing along kids, sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Gold ballroom, AK-47 dancin'
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
Couple stolen T.V.'s and a seat belt for my safety (Uh-huh)
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials
Of a block party that stop for a second, then it rekindle
I heard that from a block away, probably had credentials
Hello Mi-Mister Miyagi, I want them Kenwood woofers
Murder was the melody you should know what the chorus is
You was with your daddy on Bullis Road
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane
Shot like I knew Big but I'm enormous
So go tell ‘em I killed it you fucking informant
I’m in the air with it like a new pair of Jordans
Walk to church bishop said he lost his Bible this time
That’s the imagery I delivery when I fuck a rhyme…
Jay Rock motherfuckers you know what comes after that
Watts City, Eastside baby
I’m in deep space now when I write, no pen no pad in my mind when I write
You can’t do me, this game’s like an ocean catch a nigga floating on the top like a boat…Rock!
Kendrick Lamar, Rock, and Tone put you back in your seat
I'm back in this piece
Join the cause or hit the hills when disaster released
The passion in me
Ali, you thirsty on Twitter!
You boo-boo!
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
'Cause every time you come around
Shut the fuck up... scary ass
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
'Cause everytime y'all come around
Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!"
You turnt down, you weak
What is HiiiPoWeR?
What we’re about to do is raise the level of expectations
You don’t have to be rich
Was God-given, but now I'm God, hate to intervene
I sic a lyric on you like K-9's from the police
You heard me? I'm a motherfuckin' problem, puto
And they tell 'em K-Dot got next
But, of course, I'm a short fuse ready to blow
Go 'head and put your gun down, we can go toe-to-toe
Tick-tock, boom when you infants give me some room
A breath of fresh air, DJBooth.net and Dot
My life is likely to see great endeavors
When she wearing a tight belt
In time, it'll come
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blastin'
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Then come back home
Go out and get it
See I'm tryna get to get right off the shit that I write
Pops engine in this old school run tiiight!
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
I wish I was fed forgiveness
And pessimists never struck my nerve
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Tell me somethin'
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Phone never on, I don't conversate
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
All the stars are closer
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
Oh, you important?
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
All the stars are closer
I got i got i got
Eyes open wide
Standing ovation and celebration for our DNA
Devils that like to slow dance
Bloody Jordans and Popeye's
Reminiscin' bout Zion
Tigers, bears and lions in every jungle that I am
I'm hurt, so, nigga, don't at me
I watched him as he took a fifth of Henny to the head in memory of his brother
Clinchin' his fist on some angry shit
I tried my best to make him re-neg
Corners become monuments for the dead
Rest in peace, the yellow tape blockin' off the streets
A baby mama yellin' at the police
But you don't understand
You figure that we're just a bunch of niggas but the picture here's a story untold
Babies from the late '80s wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way
Complete chaos when we off X pills and St. Ides
He came back fifteen minutes later
"Seen a few niggas slippin' and I just started clappin'
I love you nigga make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
I got up, went to Rite-Aid
Hopin' that the pharmacy department had the right aid
I bought it and left
(The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
It's a revolving door
My whole life
Fucked up, right?
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
Well, momma's scratching lottery tickets knowing that it's just a fairy tale
Every time that she's bubblin' in, it feels like the devil's holding a pen
It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
That means what I'm thinking is right
Punch, loop the beat for a minute
Moment of silence for J. Dilla, he on his way home
If dreams was reality
The only way that you can escape poverty
I suggest you go back and press rewind
Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the paint
Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring - the industry need a fix
We only love to hate each other that's striving for great-ness
Take that blue pill then we start seeing spaceships
Bring each other down, crab in a bucket effect
Materialistic things that we buyin' now means nothing later when the dream kick in
Traveling, no direction, the aimless casualty
The streets mowed him, can't make past that
What happened in Manhattan happens all the time
In the hood, conspiracy to cover up crime
I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the president
Same stage look at us as some educated apes
What if a dream was reality and reality was a dream?
Get it with the Glocks
K-Dot is hot
You don't have to tell me, I know I'm the shit
I'm faithful, to whatever I stand for
Ard ho learn your lesson
Get it with the Glocks
For my niggas that know right
K-Dot is hot
Matter of fact, you should take four b
For my niggas that hate the fights
Get it with the Glocks
Quickly push back your dome like a hot comb
Now who fuckin' with me? Me and that gun was born siamese twins
I swear in the vocal booth is where I'll take my last breath
You sit and watch the young child with my money stacks
For my niggas that know right
K-Dot is hot
You don't have to tell me, I know I'm the shit
(Work out for me, work out for me)
Swinging swords like I'm sparring with a Spartan
I drop a real jewel like a Martin, fool
No judgement for a plaintiff
But I've been O.D. since '03
I'm J-A-Y, Rock to be exact
Niggas said gardens, Watts on the map
All my life in the ghetto on the peace side nigga
Niggas don't box, they buy more guns
Don't sleep, don't sleep
My daddy told me that every day
Then reality starts to set in
I'm married to the streets and I ain't never had a wedding
Guns in the closet for niggas who start tripping
Stay in the house when them choppers come out spitting
Shock 'em like thunder
Darling, I told you many times
Just to remind you, sweetheart
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
But witnesses couldn't prove it
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
One curse at a time
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits

Ha ha ha, Lady G, Whaddup?
Apparently you ain't nothing but industry crash dummies
And rhyming like Rakim in ’89
Don’t wanna pack a nine just a mind full of wisdom
Don’t freeload on my vision
And my hip to the hop don’t stop as I rock
I got a buzz like a shot of Palmer Sun
And the women fall in love as they fall in my crotch
Hear the difference? I’m cool like that
The realness in my bones is the DNA to life
I’m looking past y’all like a fastball - strike!
I’m comfortable enough to go and chill out with a Huxtable
To whom say he cool: but the irony is I could hold the bottom of an iron with the bottom of my palm
I say so much, so little all action, no talk like a mime throwing up gang signs
I’m a Jaguar; you’re just a new cat, now move back
Aiming for the top like an AR aimed at your neck
Nipsy got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred
We ain't what you think and you think we’re back
I need y’all to feel me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Y'all know, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go!
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
An imaginary rich nigga, ayy
We okay, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go, yeah, I go, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow, yeah, the flow, yeah
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at they laces
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Goddamn us all if you won't (Yuh)
Because it's all in your eyes, most of y'all tell lies
Most of y'all don't fade, most of y'all been advised
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
It's the one and only, the world's greatest, the Kid Capri

Bad trips like, "Yah!"
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Wouldn't you know
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
Nigga, we gon' be alright
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
Kobe really retiring
Back to Kobe, fallaway pull up
Oh! What a way to finish!
Never meaningless could never mean less
That's what he means at this moment
Jack to Jeanie
I'm-a make sure you do
The off-glass buzzer beater over D-Wade
The helicopter
The mashed-up gamut of emotions with you and with ourselves is so deep
I don't think nobody can break that bond
Even your DNA is placed in these L.A. concretes, man
Know that it's never goodbye
And this from a person that never believed in religion
Walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
What am I gonna do
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
It's jungle when the niggas in zoo
Cats lying through they teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
It's ill, to see my faith try and leave me
It's so hard to get it, to get rid of it is easy
I'm tryna reach Cloud 9, that's what my niggas 'bout
Cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
I watched people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
Woo woo woo (she got some good head)
Woo woo woo (she got some good head)
Tell your girlfriend I beat it up
Wee wee wee (that’s funny to me)
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
I was in high school
Earrings bamboo
I put that on me
Well you know curiosity killed the cat
So as we walk home from school show me where you live at
Walked out, she hopped on the phone, girl he did that
So I can get some fame, about my pipe game
Wee wee wee
I think back of when I chased that cat
Maybe get some dome
And then I’m gone
Off to the next
Let them play the good role then we make them cake mix
But I'll be damned if I give 'em my handout
I'm too proud to beg, I'm sorry Left Eye
If I don't make it in life, motherfucker I tried
I need to, I need to
Sick of pursuing, that your time will soon come
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Very, very far from here
Instead of problem solving
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a dread
As I fly through the galaxy, pain and the agony
Configuring my style to the streets, bring dark to the light
A Schoolboy soon to be star, Mr. Lamar
Very, very far from here
I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth
What's up, family?
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Reffus attog I od doG yhw ,doG yhW
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
My newfound life made all of me magnified
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
God damn us all
So until we come back to these commandments
Because He said He's gonna punish us
Are the true children of Israel
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
God bless you
(Nobody prayin' for me)
I feel like you may be the problem
And fuck you if you get offended
Ain't nobody prayin'
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I ain't feelin' your presence
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Darkest hours, lost it
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Now my dick ain't free
You know stress carries on, now your kids reap the mistakes that you made
Are you celebrating me as the artist or just a prophet?
Lyrics from Snippet 3
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
But remember, he knows the Bible too
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit"
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
I want you to know that Lucy got you
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
It's not so easy
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
Jesus take the wheel [inaudible]
Homie you on one
But if God got us
Then we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Everything I sow, so my karma come
Tell the world I know it's too late
Wouldn't you know
Hitta, and we hate po-po
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Look, you can live at the mall
I don't think about it, I deposit every little zero
We gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Mixin' Hen with similac my momma knew I had a problem
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
You know
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend'll like
She say she love it when it sounds like this
She had a long day and plus I know she wanna vent
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I'm Playing shit my girlfriend'll like
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
How many I fucked
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I'm playing something that my girlfriend'll like
Told you that my girlfriend'll like
(Verse 3: Ab-Soul)
Kendrick I got you
Kodak moment every time we in sync
I wrote some shit that my girlfriend'll like
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we...
Make it a 1X-Tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
ARCO station on Avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
Rocking platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
I might pull out the green Larry Bird on special occasions
The bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
This ain't for you, so what?!
Kendrick:
Goin' off the top of the dome
Kendrick:
Troi Breeze:
I been grownin' in it like I was a tree with you
Tryna go off of that energy, I know you feel my "inner G"
They dont want shoot back
Make some noise for my nigga
Make some noise for Troi Breeze
Me, I've been searching, for that right one
I found her
Shout me her number and said make sure I call, oh
A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby
Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious
Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious
A friend of mine said that you are good company
Gotta have it baby
I can be your lover, be your friend
Have it your way like a shoe custom made whenever you need
Or maybe like a chain of Burger King's
And if it goes well we can make you a flip
So please tell me you accept my proposition
Hallelujah, K. Dot'll do ya
Sharing war stories with the deceased, I'm brain dead
On fire, make a rapper burn his soul
Numero uno, city in my rearview
With the pump, punks jump up to get beat down
I load up then I aim it
No judgment for the plaintiff
(Fuck a hook)
(Fuck a hook)
(Damnit, genius)
They hydroplaning, hoping that they get their big break
In a stolen Cavalier like I took LeBron
(Psss) Now that's a stretch Ab-Soul
Call me Dolomite, nope I take that back
Found out he gay as a happy day or the way that you rap
(Damnit)
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
Or maybe the white on white, Ku and Klux
I got my own but one ain't a dollar
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
That don't mean shit to me
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
They getting off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody, please hold up your wallets
That's starstruck and roast you, oh my
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein before calculus
I'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her
Put them 3's up, they notice that we up, HiiiPower
Fiends trying to kick the addiction of sucking glass dicks
Vivid images go against any fantasy you can fathom
My innocence would eventually see a hindrance
Heard it over my bunk bed ear hustling
His eyes red he's smoking on marijuana mixing the two eleven
Further than the streets and remain to be on the honor roll"
Backpack raps with gats in it
And they want stripes so they shoot off bikes and you know
He tried to throw his flame but I ducked and I stabbed him
That's a metaphor for any rapper who want it
You probably think I'm dope like the it's the realest shit I wrote
I stare at them four walls and rap like I'm mad at God
And, of course, when that took its course
The killers on sight of me, privacy obviously was lost
And the fraud piracy of the streets in my odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed
I walked down the street with no heat
And run into beef when I'm just a vegan
Reekin’ the scent of a saint, sinner smell it then start squeezing
I’m really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
I seen 'em from afar then I seen a piece of my jaw
When you hear the people in awe
Like "damn it, he made it"
My homies are not alarmed
I'm guessing this is the part where my heart
A cape and some superpowers can't save me
I do my stuff (Pump)
Of an officer, got his mind made on off'n ya
As the colors of pink and yellow on Wesley Snipes
Vengeance of hatred is what I'm facin'
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang
By the time you hear the next shot, you'll learn that L.A.P.D. is the biggest gang (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Yeah. How I sound out there Ali? Good? Then good
Had to hide the bottle because there was mix with Hennessy and soda
Every time we rode up we was unsober
Could of lost our life over hood rats
We was dumb as fuck but lucky for us we was lucky enough
Size 5 Jordans, Rolex sporting, and wanna fight everybody she knows
She said,"No", he said, "Oh yeah
Rosecrans and what? She said, "Don't matter just know I fuck
She said, "Yeah daddy I can you get you sprung
If you come over make sure that you bring drink
And that he did, that Friday he was where she lived
But didn't give a fuck cause he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
Walked in the house, rubber on, panties down
Kissed that bitch in the mouth then walked to the door
Get your ass killed bitch! How?
Them hoes hoes, them scandalous hoes
He wasn't born it, Boys in the Hood the movie made him think it was all good
Never pull out if you don't use it
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
Yeah
To it like a trombone I'm so blown and um
So come on, you get the one with the drum on it
Boss man, pimp stro, pimp stro
I can let my money go when the wind blow
And make them bitches understand me like 10 fo
Niggas is simple, like instrumentals
Come to the beach and find
All I need you to do is just shut up and ride
I had a Lammy in school
Now I got yesterday's food on me
Now that was real rude, homie
500 Degreez this time biotch
Man I got weed, pills, pistols, all crack
Bitch niggas where ya hearts at?
Ya'll ain't stuntin' like us
I'm about to lock it from the summer to the fall and back
And the wheels on my car you got all of that
It ain't October 31st but we gone mask up - and guess what
And mommy hot cause pull up in that white thang
Me in my building with 20 bricks in the ceiling
And all my people tote chrome - we some monsters man
Baby blue Mercedes Coupe - Got it bullet proof
Make me shoot my 80 duke at your fucking roof
Bitch get your mind right, Bitch get your mind right
Take 'em to church
Momma don't cry
Grandpa gone and grandma ain't coming home today
But
Though I'm under the gun I'm aiming for the sun
So I sold that
So I held dat
Vaseline it up and ship it out in gel packs
I failed at what the teacher used to yell about
But my momma knew her baby boy was fresher
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
My Mama Mia ain't raise no Fredo
You gotta make that thing flow like a ?
The face blows, the gats
Photogenic, we expose a rat
I'm ducking the county boys with they billy bats
Ball with me
This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
I'm where the G's at
We like “where the G’s at?”
C Notes not B Flats, ya understand me
Just as quick as the wind blew they went too
I probably shouldn’t speak like that

With no seeds
So she can't eat
I lived life numb
It made so much sense for me to run
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little I tote my gun
Cause niggas is crazy
You should be proud of me
And my temperature's raisin'
Somebody shower me
But she just say, "Baby", she just calls me "Baby"
M.-O.-E
Time is money, so I spent it all trying to order more
They say beef is a poor man's sport
This a gut check, now who do I write it to?
You can get your head cut off with a saw, yeehaw
Money over bitches, and above the law
And if the bitch stealing, I know where her Mama live
25 lighters on the dresser, yessir

Nope, both in the trunk
You don't want my niggas creepin through ya hooood (Through ya hoood)

(Verse 2, Paul Wall)
Catch ya cut, run and hide
Hit them legs and crease ya up
Then I hit the spot with a bad bitch
I wear the heat, just like Alonso
In a low post, I'm on the box
This flow got you way out of character
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
My ho legs spread wider than your wings nigga

I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em kudos)
I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em adios)
I should've known you would cross me (Yeah)

They say I ain't a rapper I'm a trapper
I'll fuck your bitch in your crib, watch the kids after
I don't, I should've known she ain't really love me
I should've know she just want to fuck me
I fucked up, don't judge me
Some of the closest niggas to me, they don't come around
I should've known you would cross me
I don't cry about it
And I barely get sleep anyway
Yea

Yea, You Understand?
If you can't take it

But you know presidents don't cry right?
Cause this rap is real... ya know?
I hope you ain't too tired to cry
Listen
Lost a few homies and the grief still sittin on us
And them bitch ass police canines, teeth still grittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy roll the L
But now they all rappin, my niggas, so now I must make it happen
Cause even though we couldn't, The Lord saved him
He was a East boy, and so was Wesy West
So if I cry dont stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped the beat
So much shit just sit on this mind of mine
I smoke back to back
And fuck a man with a badge
Man you woulda thought they killed corn bread
And the complaint goes on
Or my late grandmother, Ms. Mercedes Carter
The old man hustle 'till his heart stopped
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out I hope he glad for me
You are listenin' to the future Wee-zy F. Baby
I ain't got high expectations I'm just expecting my money

And the main character dies at the end, usually
Hustler by law, support when I can
Smell my shit as I walk off the stand
Nuts to my feet with my heart in my hand
Pardon my G, but I'm one of a kind
If I get pulled over, bitch I'm gon' do time

Built on some solid shit, bad bitch born rich
Chandelier (Shit), marble full of bricks
Bitch I'm on that Patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked
Bitch I'm from New Orleans
And I come from Hollygrove
That bitch is wild as a safari

We "good night" these niggas, you look like these niggas
Hit him up, hunt 'em down, hurry up
But bitches comin' 'round with the funny love
It's ashes to ashes, dust to dust
We don't wear masks, 'cause it must be us
I'm a warlord to these fuckin' boys
Cops pulled up, and they vomited
Y'all lil' niggas small time
It's still wartime, wartime, wartime
Pull up, "Brrt," skrrt
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Leave a message in the dust just for me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

But I keep my head up like my nose is bleedin'
Hollygrove 17, I won't leave you
Like Muslim I'm calm
The engineer's recording a thunderstorm
My hunger forms
But the third times a charm
Holla
Now when I walk past, you might see an extra shadow
They tell me "don't get murked, or get locked up"
So til' the day they drop my box, fuck
I'ma ride with my Glocks up
I'm hitch hikin' on the highway of life
It's so cold
You ain't never do nothing for a brotha like me
You sold me a dream of 40 acres and a mule
Flooded out engines, messed up suspensions
Bullets start ripping through the walls
She got that hit-it-quick-in-the-car booty
Got the Jones soda with the drink in it
Party ain't popping if we ain't in it
I fuck, then see if Tune, Jay Jones, Hoody, or Mack want 'em
I'm in the club but I'm in the cut
They got cameras here like Oprah's here
Since a kid, I heard gunshots, mothers cry, all the shit soldiers hear
Abracadabra, abracadabra!
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
Don't ruin my count, bust two and I'm out
I'm spazzing up, I'm gassing up that Cali stuff, that massacre
I'm magical with chemicals and smashing stuff, Metallica
We back and forth in traffic with that Macklemore
I walk on water, float in air, I'm over there, I'm in your face
Hold on, abracadabra, the data don't matter
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Momma, nana, I'm doing my count
Music is art, Basquiat, niggas is squares, hopscotch
I haven't Bungee jumped, err, haven't been to Mount Everest, err, take that back, I've probably have been to Mount Everest. Probably flown over it, probably rolled past it and it just was twisted, you nah mean?  That's real shit, real shit, real shit. Holla at my friends, they will let you know slime has sat down and probably ate with the president, and whatever president it was at the time, totally don't remember, you nah mean? But I do remember, Obama saying my name in a speech, shoutout Obama. But still, what haven't I done yet....release Carter 5
Money ain't shit, bitches ain't neither
You know I'm on that grass, don't cut on the sprinklers
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in
Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me
All my niggas gangstas, all my bitches freaks
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
Come on make millions with me
Cause I tote, and I bang
Please say the baby
Please, baby, please say the baby
If ever he doubt me, he could do better
Ready for the drama like Knots Landing hoe
You don't need Websters to know what the bling-bling for
Cause I'm a neat freak and mama she freak me
Holla at me on some creep shit
Cash Money, Young Money that's more cash
Chyea, chyea, this is a dedication to the streets
It's Gangsta Grillz you bastards
He didn't even see me with the pistol in the shade
Pick that pussy up
Naw let him lay
Off my hip, clip empty like a muthfucka
I already smell it
I don't care what you know
And I hope your ass choke when you suck my dick
It’s like fixing broke cars, which tools i'mma use?
See I know what’s what, who’s who, and who is you
I write with the light from the lamp on my night stand
But still, I want to see more than my sight can
And yeah, the relationship is starting to feel like a chore
I write you this letter, I hope everything's grand
But I ain't tryna expose, I'm just tryna expand
Anne, I'm trying to stay up out them chicks' pants... but I just can't
This is more than a rap, this is more of an oath
And I know you're wondering what this letter is for
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
And sometimes I wish I wasn't him but I am
But it's like you make me feel like I'm a part of the fam
With you is where my artistry can, Anne
Yeah
Under them street lights
But I still find my way, and when I do I keep going, and I'm
A nigga with stripes
Correct me if I'm wrong
That's why I got guns and my guns got kids
And I be with them niggas
And ain't none of them broke
And leave your mama to cope
Or else you dying in court, mannnnn
Where the President is the enemy
So excuse my expression
All the time, we just trying
And did I mention not to mention
Give me light, and I'mma shine
My job is to survive
So Lord, keep me in your eyes
I'm tryna say
Some soft, some stepped-on, but we kept on
And I slept with the work plenty nights
If I crash, just pick up my brain
And if they do, then I'm the nigga you blame
And tell your honor he a bitch to his face
And whip through the state like I whip through the yay
Weezy, baby, that's what ya bitch say
Trip while you're full and my clip gon be emp-tay
When the stomachs get empty, anything's tempting
To stay, so they made us evacuate
Niggas doin anything, like, God gon' understand them
But please understand us, niggas with money lost mansions
Water up to the attic, there goes the stashes
No cut, tell life, "So what?"
The weed slowed up, we can't even roll up
Fuck, put a dent in the money, too
The end of the world coming and my city the proof, damn
And I'm a get death through these bars, believe me
I'm down for the cause, even
I'm a leader, me, the son of Jacida
Hey - Mama say ''don't let 'em see your page''
Don't let 'em copy you off your paper, let 'em see yo' ok
"Long as you investin' in something," I'm invested in her
Nigga coming at me sharp my ass
I'm just trying to play my part like Cass', smart like Taz
And niggas hate me like rabies
So don't be mad when you see me in the Maybach or the Rolls
Sitting so far back with the seat I'm in the trunk with the coke
I spit blood on a track, call me Dracula dough
Buck - remember when the bullet caught lil' bro?
Who you think made that boy come off so cold?
If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be
Bugatti, new boo

One man game, nigga, I'ma die alone
No bull, I push Pro-Vs like Pantene
Players get jumped like a trampoline, tangerine
Gators day, nay-sayers, mascara wearers
And my niggas on paper, getting paper like ballplayers
Rap niggas, forty-cal. to your brow (Ugh, ugh)
I feed niggas like a mess hall
You should have a gun for me, yah
And all these niggas is killers (killers with you)
I'ma kill 'em
Uptown-bound, face painted like a clown
Reciting scriptures from the chapters, Proverbs, Leviticus
And get your ass up on a mission, become some competition
Still sipping Cristal, waving the lifeline
Since life's a bitch, y'all, raising up the skirts of Jezebels
YM militia, you niggas better retreat
'Cause I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
And I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
Same hustle, new money

(This is the Dedication!)
Rest In Peace!
I carry the concerns of my mama
You probably never been to it, so now I dip through it
And they respect me like a pistol, I'm hip to it
I am the drum major, the drum section waiting
And I'm dumping my Scarlett O'Hara in the canal
The fuck out and you can automatically killed, yeah
I was prescribing medicine, you was getting your lesson in
You ho niggas is ass that's ho shit
Like "Oh shit!"
Weezy
I got flies all on my new shit
Sit on this dick, feel like you flyin' on a pterodactyl
Am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
She tell shit I never heard when I thought I heard it all
Like you perfect but not flawless but you got the perfect flaws
She laughed and said "you crazy," I said "look who's talking"
But I wonder if I leave yo' ass, would I still be shitty?
How the hell should I know, am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
Oh, how well do I know that I'm sleepin' with the devil
Pour me a drink of some few and let me spit on this ho
I told that bitch to be cool, like the temperature low
With yo' fine ass, she tell me "gimme some more"
Like high grass but I just trim it and go, I'm on my nigga shit
I call her wifey, she call me a polygamist
Play with pussy, get wet, play with fire, get burn, the roof
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
She agree to my demands too
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
The demon out the man, you
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, "Can we dance?"
She's sleepin' very gently, so now they're startin' to enter it
A demon, with demands
Took her demon by the hands, asked the demon, "Can we dance?"
Demon with demands, demon with demands
I know y’all hear 'em screaming things
My nigga
But I wanna go around the world
Then I might drink his stash
I never think because I know
I’m tippy toeing wit' your ho
I’m off topic
I’m chillin', for the moment
And I stay chokin'
While you cutting your grass
When you got nowhere to go
Dump 'em by the boats
'Til I get a full coin
When your friend gon' join?
Got a friend in the cut with a gun by the groin
I told that bitch don't question me
I’m spaced out like asteroids
I'm in love with a beauty
Flip ya' body over, have no fear
I say, "Oh, girl, I love you so"
Oh, oh, girl, I love you so (Psych)
But I don't give a fuck about a dog ass ho
Stop talkin' that shit and suck a nigga dick for an outfit ha
Oh, she pussy poppin' on a handstand
And I'm the camera man
When I can just bend you over and do what I told ya'
You'll probably see her on one of my t-shirts
I super soak a ho, skeet, skeet, skeet, squirt
Hey, I'm high over features
Haha, new single, oh, so now you single?
I’m a east side nigga but my homies from uptown
I woke up on a mission, I got 2 women I ride with
We size niggas up so wisely choose who you side with
And they can’t bite the hand I’m feeding with, I’m holding grenades
So I’mma talk my shit, I’mma live my life
I’mma nail yo girl, shit I did that twice
I’m a east side nigga
I’ve been a beast since I could remember
Chop yo fuckin head off and put it on the front of my car like the emblem
Get em, I got Mike Banger on the beat, I got this banger on display
I just test-drove a new Lamborghini and got a A
Just give me fellatio
My bitch named Gigi give me head, I be like goodness gracious, fuck
Boy I have the people looking for you like a reason uh
Hop out that Ferrari Spider for my boys at Rikers and all my lifers
But I make her say it like Tony the Tiger
I own a rifle and I’m on the edge
Probably with my niggas, but my bitch Polynesian
Met this bad little broad, she was curvy
Sipped out in the middle of the day, I started early
Drop the top on the car, let the tits breathe
Michael Myers, Norman Bates, Charles Manson
Calicoe spit like a Uzi do
Bad bitch on my arm that's my new lil boo
Pussy be so warm and it's Juicy Fruit
Trampoline with the work, I got the block jumping
Wearing lingerie and heels round the house for me
We sipping that dirty
We sipping that dirty
We sipping that dirty, you know
They haven't even heard from you
We put your wig on the shelf
They haven't even heard from you, now they gotta search for you
It ain't looking too good for you, too good for you
I ain't got no feelings for them niggas, no
This how we doing it
The Lamborghini orange like vitamin C
I'm working like a bad bladder, M.O.B
Yeah, hot spitter nigga, who you thought it was
Bitches want to hold me in the morning like a coffee mug
Pimping serious
That Testarossa can get ghost like it never seen ya
The pioneer-a, I am here-a, right here-a
Pretty women want this nigga right here-a like Richard Gere
I switch the gear, and steer and disappear
Leanin' like a motherfucker, might not even say wassup
Bet I schooled your bitch with no game plan
Niggas know I got bread, toast and pop-tarts
Standin' by the heater in the summer with the oven on
Workin' that traffic, call me the cross guard
Red rags up, where my where my B's at?
I gotta bitch named Keisha she a real dick pleaser
Her girlfriend Lisa, met her in Puerto Rico

Cause all you really need is Weezy F. Baby
Alright let me vent for a minute
Who is letting these wack niggas in?
God damn! Hey, Millz, show 'em how it's done
But she bring it all to Daddy, so that's okay
Part-time broker late nights, she work at Strokers
Ugly little thing, from the home of the Ravens
Tiffany and Emily, my bonafide sluts
Got a white chick down in Florida named Sasha
And if she nasty, we do the nasty
And I'm hella fly, and her dude dumb-bummy

Cause if she with it, I know she should be with it fa' sho
That we did it before like we didn't before
But we did it before, hehe
Yeah, so if you did it before, be a pro
And everytime I meet a girl
Cause I did it before and she will be dumb
Like Busta Rhymes said, she holla "give me some more"
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if she know well if she didn't hell know
Wishin' that everybody didn't hell know
That they did it before, like if they did it'd be low
Well if you didn't, then so, be cool with it and flow
How come you ain't with it now, but you was with it before

I'm killin' this shit, Grim Reap' flow, nigga
But I ain't finished, uh-uh
No Ceilings motherfucker! Yeah
I'm in the Red Zone nigga
Wake up in the morning with your head gone nigga
Leave the beef in the streets and bring the bread home nigga
Yeah, tell the doctor "Step aside, please"
I'm in the zone like the secondary
No lie bitch I’m flyer than a pet canary
Two women praise me like Mary Mary
We would both say
Came sooner den late
I use to
And u use to obey
I got my business together
Wish I could get together
Tell a lie
If I was even ever
Out of the most highest cloud
Yes
Now
She would be a picture
I put it on my momma
We could
Ice bright white like Jaleel
See me when you want to, find me, I'm the owner
Them yellow diamonds looking like a fridge full of Coronas
Own us, you see through like cubic zirconias
Hit em' with the Glock
Plenty colors in da chain nigga fuck Bape
Yea, bitch I'm cold like up-state
Chain on top of chain man I look like Mr. T
And I hit docks with the hickory dickory
Pockets full of bank rolls, money long as train smoke
And it come faster than a nigga fuckin' J-Lo
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
I does my motherfuckin' thing
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
No we cain't converse
I done went beyond berserk
Stack em up I back em up
They feel every slug
I took out a bag of coke, sprinkled just a little bit
Shuffle with kings, and cut off queens
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Only thing I write is checks
Homie I be gettin bread
Lookin like a fuckin EAST-er egg
And the gain in the game if I aim at your brains them bullets rippin through it
See I be labeled as the hustler's hustler
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
I noticed the route that I've chosen could bring fortune
(Chorus: x2)
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Look, and me and mack was just to niggas from the same hood, fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool
Chea, and I'm as sharp as an image, and I keep it bumpin like a mother fuckin blemish
Two twins drink me up like guiness, when I'm finished I say brilliant, when I'm finished they say Weezy you killed, I hope on your shit and they say Weezy you healed it
It's Curren$y, Weezy F Baby, Mack Maine

She say "I know you probably hear this shit a lot, but you the shit in my opinion"
She say "Who you kidding, boy? You like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Okay, I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
I'm just sayin'
Boy, this here will keep you warm at night
Feed you good before you catch a flight
I got the Feds on me right now
Then eat some lunch with you
Lil Wayne: yea, I no, elz talk to them
When the planes hit
Hurricane Katrina victim in the building
Okay, day time soldier, night time rider
And who am I to try to keep hope alive
When I'm seeing dead babies floating by
Man, they want to want to transform the streets we grew up on
Uhh, tower 1 fell, tower 2 fell
Look up and pray to whose above you
What's going on my nigga
Yes, but in the belly of the beast
In the helicopter flying looking down reading signs
And, I've seen tragedy I've looked it in the eye
Yea, I holla five on four till they bury me man
You heard me
When the levees broke
You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
When the levees broke
What's going on my nigga, the same shit
Now, if I should die before my time, Lord
'Cause through us they live
So, Katrina hit, and three days later, Fema just comin'
Or 'til I'm high and drunk and my car swerves off road, haa
And if I die, I pray my soul you keep
And i don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
What's going on my nigga
We holds our heads high after disaster
Come and be my death volunteer,"
But, 4 million, 5 million, 6 million: I'm that now
You at ground, so set down you bitch you
Money on my mind, pistol on my side
I'm on that same ass block letting the bell ring
They need drugs no penicillin and I'm the medicine man
Why would the quarterback give it to you?
I'm rocking like a big pimp
Mushroom bullets hit your body then they spread
Respect 'em or I'll put you on that highway to heaven
Matter of fact, pussy, you'll get your own lane
Straight Grand Patrón flow, there is no chasin' me
Four-four, bulldog, fuck around and bite your ass

The old man hustled 'til his heart stopped
And all I know of my real Pops is that he had money

Sometimes it feels so awkward
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"
Ooh, I like that shit

She said, "Can I come through Tunechi?"
Quickie in my roofless car, bust a nut and blew the horn
Acting like some carnivores, after that we comatose
I ain't tryna bullshit my baby and she know me better
Told her, more money, more Prada, and the more the better
I said, "And you'll need two"
We never cool down, we too hot for TV, hold on
Your ex, he so petty, fast food to her veggie
No Fugazi CZ, y'all boys really PG, damn

Lil Twist, drop a four, four, four
She said, "Babe, you so crazy and I'm your crazy glue"
I never cool down, I'm too hot for TV, hold on

And they landing in your scalp
Cup muddy-muddy, muddy-muddy-muddy
We wanna know who got the money
What these niggas wanna do?
These bitches bring luggage

So I'm swerving on them niggas
All black hoodie, all black gat to match
Yeah, put it to your hat, and Blat!
I keep the standards high as the Canyon
I treat the Grammy's like some medallions
I treat the weed like some azaleas
You see what I mean, and that's why you stare
Even the devil advised me to chill
I'm sippin' that Sleep and I'm smoking that Gone
When you reach your peak, we gon' cut off your arms
Fuck what they think, man these niggas don't know us
I'm on the front until combat is done
Even the neighbors gon' feel the vibrations
Wipe the gun off with my towel
I'm in and outrageous, I'm rippin' out pages
And then you rephrase it, we stick to invasions
Death is related, happy we made it
You ready now?
Yeah, I'm going in
Like the Energizer Bunny with a battery pack
Or pa-rum-pa-pum-pum, and I'm so young
The judge just a bitch, the jury suck dick
Carter in the office, take notes when I'm talking
Telling you where to leave the money in the morning
And watch you pussies piss in your pants
And my gang go Saddam Hussein and missile launch
I don't know karate, but after the brain, I'll kick you out
The club like a grocery, I just bag a bitch
And when my roll came down, guess what I did after it?
We chop-chop, and leave your back on the block
Give it to them hoes and watch them bitches freak away
If it heaven sent right now, she gon' give a nigga hell later
I woke up with a white bitch under white sheets
I poke him straight in his retina (Pssh)
Feel like I slipped and I fell in ya
Gotta be way more careful-er
I am not a human being, and you a humanitarian
Woke up to niggas lookin' like me, damn
Beep beep, beep beep, beep beeeeep (That's some sick shit)
I've been trying too hard
Wow, wow, I'm a shooting star, yeah
To fuckin' hide these two horns, damn
Now, I know the only compass that I need
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
Eh, so where you at with it?
'Cause I can't do it by myself, I need a ass-sistant
Some of your friends, they alright, sometimes I think y'all all dykes
I'm putting my glasses back on
"Is the one that leads back to you
"Is the one that leads back to you
David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
Grass is greener on the other side, I never do the lawn
Be a Dora, double R her, treat her like a Ford Explorer
See no evil, neither horror, my bitch eyes chinky, Kamora
David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
Twizzy baby, got these bitches swallowin' babies, talkin' nurseries
Tried to run 'way from this dick and got subpoenaed, had to clean up
Move the rock like Russell Westbrook, triple-double the whole season, woah
Tina Turner, buy it furnished, eat Italian, shop in Paris, drive a German
Tina Turner, buy it furnished, eat Italian, shop in Paris, drive a German
Black Chyna, Black Mamba, baby mama, Lady Gaga

Sellin iron all the time, and you know this
Look, back out the garage in the hog
You can’t have me but we can have a menage (that’s 3)
New Orleans, Louisiana, we love to pack gats
Don’t tempt me, I leave ya bent up in your Bentley

Run, tell you heard me rapping insane
Sellin iron all the time, and you know this
(Mack Maine) Yeah, Wayne said let it rain on them (I did)
Like, there go 2000... (ballin)
Pay your cable bill and you tryna watch the Saints
This here a classic like old school Hirachis
I pop like a soda watch the can fall off
You fuckin with the drum major, lemme play you the anthem
(*bang-bang*, *bang-bang*)
Then I flush and wipe my ass, gunslinger like I pass
I ain't on no other shit, bitch, I'm on some more shit
Call me Master J, bitch, I'm so 'bout it
'Cause we both would be Angelina and Brad'n
Shots through the window of your brand new Aston
You get out, try to run, now ya chest where them bullets crashin'
I ain't never scared, and I ain't never care
So fuck what they doing over there, I'm doing it here
You're nothing like me, fuckboy, don't be outlandish
Being broke is a foreign language for me like Spanish
It's the 504 slaughterhouse blood-bath
One-man gang, animal, cannibal
I aim and crank that bitch like Soulja Boy
When I die, let me rest with clips
Rambo, I’ma go out on my Sylvester shit, bang!
That should come off of the bench
She know what happens today
And she just posted the shit
Tell him I want him to trip
Tell him my guns gettin' skinny
Ruler clip, Rick the Ruler slick
Then we knockin' out every tooth you pick
And I can tell she's lyin', that's no lie
It cost me a arm and a dick
You shoppin' at Marshall's and shit
Plus a main account, with insane amounts
Plus the drank in route, now I'm hangin' out
Plus my main in town, and she came around
Said they ain't her style
25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
That's some sick shit
Dedication 6 yes Lord
Ayo, it’s Weezy motherfuckin', easy with the hatin'
Bitch, I’m in the buildin', you just decoratin'
Can't walk around with guns, I got a dude that got 'em
I’m up for whoever the opponent, nigga
I go hard like Rafael Nadal
I see big cheese, you niggas' blind mice
Still sticking to the script, like Nicole Kidman
My words keep going, like a teleprompter
And the flag red, like clown lips
Like how he? Why he? Cause I be
Moving through the city like an I.V
Like I'm the shit cause I'm the shit
And to my unborn I'm tryna reason with ya moms so
If I'm not with her when you get here, its already clear
I'm a pause every tear
Bluka bluka to ya face, closed casket
When it talk, you know what come out- barreltone
Yeah, I got my eyes on the sparrow
I saddled up, and get the fucking battle
I walked in this building with all these bangers
Fuck a ho today, and fuck a ho tonight!
Im' a live my life like there's no tonight
I ain't worried bout you cause I'm feelin' myself
And now my neck gettin' all jealous and things
And all I really care about is my bank ho
I met her on first base standin' all alone
I call her genius oral she give me head sex
CHORUS
Then we told Mr. Third Base we gon'
Now run around a base
And she still gettin' ate

I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
I must be doin' somethin'
She don't love me like she say she love me
Had to get it poppin' off the rip
Mothafuck the rest
On the job and the bitch overslept
I'm the only one that get the job done
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
Got the gator inside (Believe that daddy)
Slugged up in the front (Believe that daddy)
Get up your dope, I'm putting birdies out
Nigga we timin', the cost of my watch over ya house
I'm a boss man, I watch over the South
(Chorus)
(Verse 2 - Lil' Wayne)
You don't wanna play wit me, I touch you man
Lose ya man in a tussle, but y'all don't see me

And they running with my words like I'm writing on jeans
Heaven in my plans
I swear I am important like the evidence I'm saying
I'm just trying to make my alphabets as heavy as I can
I get props and every other extra credit that I can
Why? Because I'm just a standup guy
You only know me but God knows I try
Flow retarded, Special Olympics kind
Young, champ-i-on, like a lamp I'm on
And naw I ain't speaking so don't wave the blame
And if this camera shoots me dead, Lord save my chains
Listen to that Kanye again
And you ain't gotta call me the greatest mane
Young Moolah baby...
And don't McCain look like his heart about to fail him?
Forget all my adversaries, I puff the baddest mary

Ain't nobody else like you
Ain't nobody else like you
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas

But can you picture the scene after that?
Lord, I guess I just be blinkin' too fast
Man, fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Keep that shit in your shitter, or eat that shit, don't spit up, rrr!

Your thot need to get her look up, uh
That ain't sauce, that's puddin', uh
Shootin' up the jurors, damn
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Now your good luck lookin' like you crackin' mirrors
With an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
And I catch a triple, flip, kick, jiu-jitsu
And her man is simple so I had to pimp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec', I'll go at your neck
Yeah, cannibalism, goin' animalistic in a land of civilians
He the one who told me that sometimes
It make me text all my enemies and tell 'em I don't need 'em
Turn your kids into father choosers
Make your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo ya
Niggas prostitutin'
Just follow the coupe, ho, and I know that you know
The power to do so, my pockets is sumo
Mafia Nouveau, I am the uno
Real boss nigga, should model for Hugo
Pow-pow-pow, sound like a symphony, or opera, two-door
Private flight, don't fly in too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school flow
And umm, oh you know I'm gon say Steph Curry, hehe, Steph Curry

Facts nigga, trill nigga, tax nigga, still nigga
Nigga, diamonds in my teeth, shinin' like some pearly whites
Talking 'bout a war, that's a convo at the bar, wait
Drugs in the Broncos, start the motherfuckin' horse race
Some niggas got the right time, you ask him, he say, "Time'll tell"
Some niggas think they're icons, some bitches think that I care
Lyin' there, lookin' like "Aww, yeah", lawn chair
What you been workin' on nigga?
And prolly workin' on my album, ya dig
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep
I feel like a black Republican, drug money comin' in
Forget a tongue, she put a lung on it
We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig
You dudes gotta stand in the mirror backwards cause you can't face yourself
Assholes
Blinded by the light
That I love you overall, like paint clothes
Don't forget the baby is what I tell the pilot
I did overtime, I took papas duty
I vent, and show no relent, money well spent
Never really had a pop, so I never had to check in
Take ten out, brrraatt, chest is out
And I'm the dime type
And I'm walking in the lime light, still like lime
Imma rude boy, with me dreadlock
What the blood klot?
You ain't know we call the uzi the oowap

Amen, Hallelujah
Convertibles, I dont do tops
Take a sip and pop a pill when the hook drop
Dreadlock rasta, hair like pasta
Tunechi rude boy, bad man hear my shotta
Im in a two cup congregration sippin mud slides (pour up)
Guns clappin so loud, give you stage fright
They just ran in my house last week
It been fuck the world, it wanna cuddle now
I fix your frown, leave my footprints on your stomping ground
Hate when my hoes come in town unannounced
I got my own ups and downs
You lil niggas dont do shit but make my stomach growl
Doing circles in the pussy I dont fuck around
Better buckle up and stay buckled down
Take a sip and pop a pill when the hook drop
Dreadlock rasta, hair like pasta
Tunechi badman, rude boy, Imma shotta
Dreadlock rasta, hair like pasta
Tunechi badman, rude boy, Imma shotta
No Ceilings
The world is made of keys, ounces and pounds
Gotta cop it, chop it and cook it
And my J butter put more 'd' on me
Now I'mma ride cuz I got riding in my bloodline
I bleed concrete
To his album we ride we so mob
I'm pumping o's with lots of hay
And oh I just go buy a whole house
Only follow the code of the streets
But just so I can eat
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
Cuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit
I'm a beast, a dog, I see that money, I'm fetchin' it
Don't check me, go check your bitch
You don't want to get me out of my element
They don't want the steam, but I know you want the tea
That's your bitch? Why she only fuck with me? 'Cause I'm ballin', MSG (Ballin')
Roof missin' on this whip and I need two kitchens (Two)
Won't catch me in no club unless my tool get in (Ever)
War's on, that bazooka rise, get neutralized
Shoot five times five, watch you divide
Kick a nigga ass, then give him my shoes to shine
My niggas and the food is fried, the news is lies
They put on a cute disguise, you grooms is blind
It's bloody mary if you fuck with me
Straight out the hood a young hoodlum
Flip that
Debating on the mix match
Switch that from dope to coke I'm blowin up fast
(secret weapons) "I can hear myself but I can't feel myself, I wanna feel myself like tweet!"
Now my niggas is blowin up aves
Shit we just living take money take baths
Now isn't that disgusting
Fuck ya, this that 'n' the other
Then wake up to the fuckin'
Breakfast in bed don't forget my english muffin
Dick millimeter cock back and murda
If my girl catch us both in the spot she will merk us
Pussy niggas talkin all that slop we will merk cause
And yet he understood us so when we told em' break it off
Cause gangstas don't' talk one word'll be a war
You niggas jus runner up
Thats what they saying when the play me and they hear me on the radio

Im a damu blood, my relation, affiliation, soo woo nation
Thats what they saying to me
Thats what they saying to me

All about my riches, my name should be Richard
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Belly of the beast 'til it puke us, motherfucker
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
True or false, right or wrong
Keep buyin' shit, keep fuckin' hoes
Father forgive 'em for they know not who they pushin' Lord
I'm just tryin' dodge the shots they send to the God
Now when you smilin' everybody gotta look from the side
And when we hungry you look like pie
And whatever you bout, we bout it
You sleep in the field for trying the dude
And if I ask the homeboy'll eat ya face, yea!
Yeah nigga, I tell em, I'll tell em again shawty
You play hard and I’m gravel like ground dawg
Yeah nigga, you bout some money get at me nigga
That's the only way
The street keep callin I gotta change my number
She get right past the law, shit we might smash tomorrow
Shit look marble under certain light
Who that IS?...
The easy pair of Pradas, the mean three quarters
Why I feel like my Nikes the whitest?
I'm ill like hepatitis, we appeal when they extradite us
And you ask why my bitch stuck up?
Repo Man, faget you owe something
And I'ma tell you why you need to vote
I've been
I've been trappin' on the low low
They know I got that coco
I'm never with po-po
And it's always on the low-low
And it's always for the low-low
I look out for the poor folks
I'm sipped out I'm a slow [?]
I like when bitches scream "Go go go though"
And I'm keeping a low pro fo' sure
Trapping in my Polo
Promethazine I go pro, yeah I go pro
My bitch swallow cum though and even blow a bubble
I just be like encore
Too much coke make the skill shake
Wake up in the morning see a real face
Ben Franklin with the blue face
Weezy bad, naw really I'm good
All white diamonds on the front of my teeth
And I am so New Orleans like a mufucker
It's Young Money and we eatin', get your own supper
Make me go off in the trunk, get that Bone Crusher
I never been afraid, I ain't scared of nothing
They like the way I ball, they call me Hot Sauce
I got more clips than any movie you've saw
I pull up on you like I need some Grey Poupon
I got that heat, the fire, and the lukewarm
I never been afraid, I ain't scared of nothing
You hear them guns, like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
I got homies that died young and I miss 'em, tell the truth
I put diamonds in yo face so when they see me they see you
They invited me, but shit I got a meal ticket
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I did some things that I had to regret
The reaper took my homie's soul, feel like he after me next, oh Lord
How I made it out alive, sometimes I wonder
'Cause we been goin' to war since Contra
Ain't used to showin' no love that's 'cause we grew up in that hate
Tried to rob me, he got smoked for a Rollie, his time's up
Was young and great, but they still smoked him at the waffle spot
Feel this shit
I seen some things I could never forget
The reaper took my homie's soul, feel like he after me next, oh Lord
Oh, yeah yeah
36-24-36
And girl I really need to know what's up
Damn right baby you a hotty
We on a whole 'nother level now
Because I got a stack so you fall back like a reclined chairs
Her in a new V playing with her new seat
You got a cold wrist showing off the new freeze
Shawty know she got a bad body
Shawty know she got a bad body
You got such a bad body I could put it on you
Girl that head so good I would've thought you was a genius
Shawty you could have the cover shot
Have you fly shining harder than a shooting star
And girl I really need to know what's up
Shawty know she got a bad body
See your the sweetest little thing in the whole wide world
So don't say no give me a try
Shawty know she got a bad body
Damn right baby you a hotty
Coming to America like Prince Akeem
I ain't never give a fuck but then I seen
And some Pampers so he don’t give a fuck about the slammer
He just tryna stay alive, clutching on his hammer
Er'yday he wake, he just swear to do his job
And he ain't got no Twitter page but you can follow him though
I'm a dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser
Dreamed to be the Huxtables, settled for the Bradys
Caught my first case stealin' cookies outta ACME (man)
Gas cut off, my clothes smelling like kerosene
Dream chaser, keep chasin'
Dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Started thinkin’ bout things I never had
How can you hate me where I came from?
You'd be surprised what niggas do as soon as the fame come
But now I'm gettin' to it, niggas act like they deserve it
I'm a dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
And I got that four door Aston Martin on the way in
Pussy nigga, ahhhh! Right back like I never left
Still walk in the building and go bonkers with a hundred racks
Boy, I got your favorite singer really tryna fuck tonight (Ha!)
They think I signed up
'Cause I just bought a new Ferrari (New Ferrari)
And when I make a hundred I'mma buy a new Bugatti
I just call my homie and he say he got a lick
Where the cash at? Show me where your stash at
Before I let the 40 air ya out and leave that ass flat
Make a move and this muthafuckin mac squeezin'
I gotta hundred killas on my team
I got the oo-wop. tryna' get it for my momma
I got another lick, so I got another chrome
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said, "Achoo"
Got foreign bitches menaging, fuckin', suckin', and swallowin'
I did shit with Mariah
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater rest in peace
Hater rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm the lieutenant
'Cause my momma need that bill money and my son need some milk
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
Now I'm hanging out that drop head, I'm riding down on Collins
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
Had me feeling like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
You ready? Uh, uh
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
And the matter of time I spent on some locked-up shit
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lion-hearted
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
Hold up, wait a minute (Minute), y'all thought I was finished? (Whoa)
When I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented? (Yeah)
I’m the type to count a million cash then grind like I’m broke
'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
We young niggas, we mobbin' (Mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin' (Whoa)
This two-door Maybach with my seat all reclinin'
If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up!
With that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots
Hold up, broke nigga turned rich (Rich), love the game like Mitch
Half a milli last week you
This mother fuckin' summer
Fuckin' all these bitches
Still snappin' though
My man got booked with a stone of white
Talking jumping out of Bentleys, jumping on them bikes
Now it's Italian marble, moon walking like Mike doing
Peanut butter jelly on a french toast, eating right
Champagne gargling, everything is marvelous
I'm on now, I got neighbors like in 3 states
Do it for the vine, I ain't gonna do it
So what you think I did, I went and fucking got it
Back in the day, packing the K
Ay, ay
Yeah, yeah
If I cuff you promise ain't no sharin' you, say it
You cut from a different cloth, they don't make this material
When you said you need some more time, let you get a watch
And if that nigga start acting up, just hit my line instead
Food for thought, not for a thot

A little shorty, heart colder than December in the morning
And stay away from them haters cause they'll riddle you
And that was and-one, they thinking how we get this far?
My heart getting cold, and the streets getting colder
They said I wouldn't make it no way
Dedicated, determinated and disciplined
So they couldn't blame me when I went and copped a Ruger
Cause if he catch you sleeping he's gon' knock out your medulla
Oblongata, I'm a father and my son don't see a lot of
In a field out in Philly do you feel me?

They gave birth to you, know what I'm saying?
Shit have your own mama talking to you like you ain't shit
Dear mama, dear papa, family, we're all we got
And we started off as kids, stomach's touching our ribs
And your main wanted to fuck me nigga, I ain't hit
Like Kobe Bryant, Metta Peace and Gasol, nigga
You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit
Jealousy in your eyes, I swear that look was deceiving
You said you would ride but shit, I know you ain't mean it
They said I would't make it no way
Woah, don't you, baby, hey
Don't you know?
When it was time to stand up for me, see, nobody stood
A green piece of paper can turn you to a hater
So I pray these niggas real close, talkin' closer than my neighbors
Scream, "Ride or die," I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous, you wouldn't even grind with me
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
See, I look at it like this
Goin' city to city, can't take my son to school when I want to, can't see my mama, my family when I want to
I ain't never even think about a nigga callin' my baby mama to pick my son up to take him to the movies
Go play basketball while I'm doin' this time in the cell
Actin' like I owe you somethin'
Through the storm, nigga, I'm like Derrick Rose on a 50-point night on a daily basis, nigga

So don't come to me talkin' 'bout no money shit, nigga

It's hard to weed 'em out, even Jesus had Judas, gone!
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it
Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Poppa don't preach, a-all we do is just reach here
While my hoes doing magic, voodoo Moulin Rouge

I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it
Triple doubles, two bricks and tech squeeze
Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (wooo!)
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Yeah, the competition's all but died to me
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
Blacks in prison, no
All the shit I've been through
Got 'em in 18 or break
Rest in peace to real gold diggers
Might've fucked a whole crew of millionaires
Young bitches pick and choose wrong
Had some homies fresh outta prison
New ways, new days
401Ks, hoes love 'em
It might just be a letter from a long time ago
I hope you pussy muthafuckas die
I just want to ride Italian leather, acting like you don’t know me
Euro designer palace, fuck my bitch on Missoni
Couple million records sold, still say I’m poisoning
We ain’t got to touch hands nigga, put your order in
And I feel like they want to take my life
Get the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race
To all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae
Stood on every couch, in the A at the black party
Ain't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'
This ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters
Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies
Chess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin
Stay woke, nigga, or get out
Still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
Adonis is your son
Love that baby, respect that girl
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
I'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
I got the devil flow, nigga—six-six-six
Surgical Summer, Volume 1

Execution
At your front porch, and he's handing you your paper
Ayo homie, the chambers is 36, they new and improved
Run in the bank with no dollars, got the nerve to switch crews
A cartel, compound, a carvel, a large scale in Scarsdale
I fuck with golf now, Shallah is ill
With tuna salads and palaces, yo, we smoke out them chalices
God, I was Lucifer's neighbor
Moving with lasers under Rugers
Y'all peep niggas, write it down and try to be niggas
Second-hand swept across that pretty Breitling
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You save that for the one you buying red bottoms
Rolled a blunt so perfect, thought it came up out a factory
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Bitch look at me now, I'm Tony Montana
Gave me 2 options, hell or the slammer
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I just wanna see you down on your pretty knees
You grown and you sexy, you following the fiend
You in college now, so you too old to tease
And I ain't being selfish, we can't call it greed
Cause I return the favour like playing to the screen
Yeah, she claiming that she didn't know
I'm never empty handed, coming from out of town
I don't deny it, baby I just buy it
We both give a little, we just play it fair
Put out cards on the table, let's play truth or dare
You my new girl, you allowed to give me goose neck
We don't give a damn, who's watching
Me slowing down, not an option
Ayo, you rocking with Chicago's baddest female rapper, L Street, and you now rocking with DJ Hood. It's official. Let's get it.  Aye shouts out to my lil homie, Young Oliver
Couldn't cleanse my soul with them civil rights' hoses
Panoramic roof under glass like a coaster
Downright sinful, bitch, we been full
Blew through thousands, we made millions
Cocaine soldiers, once civilians
Bought hoes Hondas, took care children
Lent my pastor, build out buildin's
Come back, baby, try me one more time
All that shit came from pressure
Push
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
The good die young, all dogs go to heaven
It's a mil' in the caravan? (Whoa)
I need you darlin' to set me free
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind

Still got the Macs out, pull the mask down like a mascot
Re-Up Gang, P the nigga, 'Ye done hit the jackpot
Trouble on my mind

Trouble on my mind

Never imagined being stuck with you
Top back, we on vanilla seats
All them other hoes, and that they niggas weak
Got you talking in dollar signs
I don't blame her, I don't change her

Now where the fuck did you learn that?
These women ain't shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl, you different
True love is hard to find
Just might trust you with my drugs
Pass codes, we past this
My bitch stunting, that's me
I'm breaking bread, and that's key
Know them haters be watching
They still know that I'm balling
Your ex nigga, your next nigga
Might trust you with my money
Girl, I'll trust you with my drugs
These requirements
Trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
Hustle in the hood, strong with the bands
Or being something bad I could bone at the bag
Dancers get exposed
Missing you when you not around
We text each other when out of town
These other women stay pretending
Untouchable, uncrushable
Yuugh, I drops every blue moon
Still wishing on a star
The grills like, interior gauze
The soft ceiling’s open, I Cross-Fit the coca
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
A quarter million a year and that don’t bounce
I’m in the score of these movies, I’m losing count
Mu, you knew me from thirteen hundred an ounce
I could show you the strange fruit
It’s looking like Beirut
These kilos are drought killers, I flooded the Jesús, I made use
Uh, the drop-top specialist
You changed right before my eyes, you picked the wrong flower
Go on right through the front door
Boy now that the tables have turned, don't let me see you begging
It's a hard life lesson to learn, when it's me you're not getting
So low but you're all alone, and now you got no power
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Go on right through the front door
Don't know what you think I'm after
Bye I'll see ya later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
To all hustlas with the same interest
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I'm what dreams are made of
I'm what dreams are made of
Nothing match the feeling of pulling up in that new toy
The bricks fell, I skip jail, live to tell about it
I’m what dreams are made of
I’m what dreams are made of
I'm top five and all of them Dylan
I am the hope, the dope dealers won
Price and the quote, the dope dealers want
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Watch face came with a fuse box (fuse box)
Murder on the highway, the news is at six
Got a surrogate, his kid get two dads"
Seven pill nights, who know what that feel like?
Price and the quote, the dope dealers want
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
You can piece the whole puzzle here
I am the don of Vuitton

Woooh! They said be all you can be, nigga
Yaagh! They said be all you can be, nigga

Entrepreneur, strip club connoisseur
Hot fudge sundae, pour it on you, hallelujah
And I be on my own dick, ain't that much room for you, ah
Red, white, blue, I pledge allegiance to the street life
All day I dream about sex, three stripes
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
We the type of crew to get fresh just to sit in the living room
They said be all you can be
One on my arm, that's decoration
To the top escalating, elevating
I just wanna buy another Rollie
Knee-deep in this dope money
Even if you got money, still lookin' for more
With no Js on, I'm still lookin' to score
If no child's left, then how can we leave them?
You can't relate 'cause you wasn't there
Nah, you wasn't hot, let me make it clear
This the life for the fast
(They have to do anything)
(You stand up to anything)
Who ain't get to go to school like a J. Cole
(But you'll stand up to anything)
(When the void is filled)
When the love is real, you can do anything
Make them walk like their 30 years is right around the corner
Always thinking big now they praying for downfall
Cook it down everytime I come around
Cause I hit the ground running from the birds I flew
Say you telling on me, told them folks bout me
Cook it down everytime I come around
Cook it down everytime I come around
Yeah
You can’t kill a God like the Romans, uh
Take my time to craft shit

Ha Imagine that, where you from nigga?
Crutches, crosses, caskets

RG3 nigga, be that
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
He’ll sit and clip at your lines like he ain’t heard of you
I seen it happen before, that man will murder you
Like a ghetto girl with the good weave sewn in
And you new niggas don’t get to pass go
Clear the road to the riches but I can’t pave ‘em
Skins vs. blouses, you mirror Prince
Chappelle Show, all of you Neal Brennans
The swag don’t match the sweaters
Three racks just spent on my Marty McFly's
Now I’m back to the future, my career deja-vu you
When you muthafuckers thought I would hardly survive
Tiptoe-in but the whole while clonin'
She walk like its hers but the whole world knowin'
Just venting I never wish to be famous
Put Trey up on your hook, still couldn't save 'em
I'm just the one to send you off, bonjour
Skins vs blouses, you mirror Prince
The talk don't match the leather
These Margiela verses all of you mall dwellers
Coffins for my old b*tches' orphans
Play the Fendi bucket like a sharks fin
And as we bow our heads at night, rich, wealthy
Yo, Young, Jeezy, Jizzle, Snowman (amen, amen)
We gotta give the streets what they want, man (amen)
Dollars make sense, I’m tryin' to get paid
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
On your downfall, sittin' there, waitin’?
So tell me what they really gon’ say to him
I need the ice, I need the lights, uhh
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
Saleen, yeah that’s a Mustang
They say they want that dumb shit, well, this is ignorant
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Drug dealers anonymous
How many Madonnas can that Mazda fit?
Hat trick under my mattress
Date I stop still has an asterisk after it
As I wash away my sins like a catholic
Who the fuck ain't mastered this
Life’s a bitch
A to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick
You thought I would miss my blessing
Bitch I been brackin’ since the ‘80s
Who deserves the medal of freedom is my accountant
IRS should’ve had the townhouses surrounded
We got storefronts, we got employee stubs
Bling bling
Mules move the drums, take ‘em to different spots
I’m a course of miracles with this shit
Life made me ambidextrous
Countin’ with my right, whippin’ white with my left wrist
Ayo French
You, you know I'm bout that life right?
Pusha!
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
I'm gettin' low, hold me from the haters
For every brick broke down it's one stepped on
For every bitch I showed the way, it's one that kept hoin'
When you lookin' in the mirror
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
As we took single engines and turned 'em to Boeings
Loss lot of niggas, some in Club Fed
Better know who you is
I'm gettin' low, hold me from the haters
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Heartbroke, yours don't look like ours
Throwing that flag up running around you hot shit
We the ones that judge juggling the gavels on
That's why you'll never be my neighbors
Smile as you waving but we know you niggas hate us
Don't be scared get everything you came for
Little do you know we don't miss shit
Beef will have you praying to God
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time
I’m gon' ball like I’m 7 feet tall
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
Still up on my Nino, smelling like a kilo
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
More than my winnings, we can share opinions
Like baby steps, we can share beginnings
Walk before you run, but she so independent
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
Seems like haters never take a night off
I gon' ball like I'm seven feet tall
But I'm downy fresh soft white like my Pinot
Feeling myself so if he know like we know
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights
In a perfect world
I gon' ball like I'm seven feet tall
Shop until you drop
We can share opinions
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself
Seems like haters never take a night off
It's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
Now I'm looking at a dream hand
You can call me smoking ace
In a perfect world
Just my guns and my girl
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
I’m disgusted
‘Cause this week look like last week
They both named Ashley
Now they asking for the feature
I hope you betting on the sleeper
Now they asking for the feature
Drug money kicked around like it’s FIFA
One more cup and I might take off
I don't know about ya'll, but I'm a get off, cause I'm feelin myself
The driver of that car was a?
Feelin myself so if he know like we know
Shop till you drop they say sharing is caring
And I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
Play my cards right, now I'm looking at a dream hand
No joker see it, you can call me smoking ace
They think that they know

And I'm starting a new life, we're hanging
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight

'Cause that's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
Pusha know these politics is paradox
It's flesh and blood 'til I'm fresh as fuck
That's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
Now that's how the ting go, back from Santo Domingo
Mike WiLL Made-It
The same rappers talkin' next year will be Uber drivers (Fuck 'em)
Trap door shopper, they rotate the wall
330 spin, cook a steak up on this grill
Me myself and I, we like a hamster in the wheel
With a questionable pen so the feelin' ain't real
I can paint the picture with the words if you listen (shh)
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
But I’m a thinker, methodic in my motives
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Descended from kings, we at it again
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Follow the codes, ain’t no love for these hoes
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
I got you, my nigga, hold on
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
I was pissing my shorts having rich nigga thoughts
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home
Hoping to land their ass on all top 5 listes
I wish you niggas well, you niggas wish I fail
My drug ring's a multi-million dollar crime wave
Get this money back, counter-clockwise
Little bubble on the cut like peroxide
I ask forgiveness lord, in hopes of getting more
Have mercy on me, they put curses on me
My Name is My name coming soon
Waving at rude boy, I'm wavin' at you, boy
These ain't the same type of hits, boy
That was ten years ago – if you know, you know (Yeah)
This thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours
(If you know, you know)
And you and your team are the motorcade
Two bad hoes in two-piece bikinis
The skybox is right next to RiRi's
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
If you know 'bout the carport
That's the reason we ball for
If you know, you know
A fraternity of drug dealers ringin' off
Too legit, they still lookin' at me with one eye
But a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff
I only ever looked up to Sosa
One stop like a Walmart
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door's supposed to be awkward
Circle round twice for the encore
You ever been hit with the water weight
Been grantin' wishes like a genie
Two bad hoes in two-piece bikinis
Solely responsible for showin' rappers how to stand
(If you know, you know)
Circle 'round twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)
I earned my name just like Marlo
Red light, yellow light, green light, go
The bitch still hissing, snake charmers magic
Missin' dope money sends chills up my spine
Got me feeling like Hov in that bubble Lexus
Yes!
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy
Ferrari, my 40th, blew the candles out
He see what I see when you see Wayne on tour
Shit, I’ve been exposed, I took the crack and built the wire
Your rap songs is all tryin' my patience
But let us all play along
We all know what niggas for real been waitin' on

Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
That Louie and my cologne when I'm riding in that Lambo
Lakers - Heat, camera seats
Ah, y'all can get them clips
White seats on that Countach
Have you ever seen a Countach?
Damn, damn, I just crashed it
A birds eye view got me channelling my vision
Pussy getting wet as she walking through my morgue
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
Same graduation I was clapping in the rafters
The truth hurts everytime it’s revealed
Villain like Candyman, say my name and I’ll appear
When him touch mike everybody haffi puddung an run weh
That's the energy I'm missin'
A thousand drug dealers with the cruelest intentions
I'm Kobe goin' for his sixth ring, while that church choir sing
But none of you niggas 80's and 90's rhymin'
And bad bitches steered wrong by they loose mamas
It's the wrath of the caine
My name is my name!
My name is my name!
To make it you need more than talent, more than hustle
And niggas wit their hands in the white like blackboards
I’m on a crash course
As a God amongst men
Rinsed drug money, I done paid for my sins
Books and the lawyers, I done paid for my friends
Wear your little jewels, you could floss when you’re dead
Me and Tim, it's coming, it’s gonna kill ‘em
Now we breaking new ground

Richer male, ?, remarkable timing
Bithces love my ambience
Blew a fuse and caught a body on
It's like an itch you can't scratch
Throwing on the shearling, collars up, bottles up
Updated that, upgraded that
Suffocation blue, in the inside's potato sack
Searching for the fishscale like I’m tryna find Nemo
That's what happens when you Michael
And they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work
See my face on the news and it ain't Tivo'd
Searching for the fishscale like I’m tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
Bell Biv DeVoe, push poison like a copperhead
The Rosé bottles pour for the champions
It's like an itch you can't scratch
Feds listening to conversations through my OnStar
Tony Montana, tailor made suits in the church
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable timing
Thousand keys that I'm about to do Pilates on
Candy coated parked, doors ajar, on a stripper, blew a fuse and caught a body on
Now crawl for him

Big said, “Only the FEDs I should fear”
Yeah, shoot up shit then we blow the scene
And spend it all until I’m swallowing dirt
'Bout that bread, I drop a coffin 'bout it
Luckily was somethin’ in the ceiling, keep dealin ya
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
We gon' keep it tight, rip it out the plastic
No excuses, no regard, step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first Grammy was my first brick
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!
But never been a foot soldier
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!
Father knows best, wash my hands, all's forgiven
Grant's, Jackson's, no room for George
Eliminate the fools ghouling imitation ice
My music's for your soul, inspiration for your life
Help my young bitch see her way through her bachelors
The truth hurts every time it's revealed
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
All of them fallin' for the love of ballin'
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And tell me that it's random
I need more drinks and less lights
He said "take them glasses off and get in the pool"
And what's a black Beatle anyway, a f*cking roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in f*cking coach
It ain't funny anymore try different jokes
I'm coming after whoever. Who has it?
That y'all, it's like that ya'll
Forgot about two things, my black balls
Uh, look, Uh uh
The making of this man, I let you see the higher me
But adios, I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Tryna snatch my niggas back I blew a small fortune
This is my time, this is my hour
This pole position, I made a lane cause they blocked ours
Call me "daddy" from a complex
When them lights on you, and them letters big
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For eleven years, we seen better years
They name dropping 'bout caine copping
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks
But Instagram pics show more than side views
As long as you and I both know we just fuckin'
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Hey mama, come fuck with the shotta
Don't listen to your best friend, she don't matter
Chanel or Celine, however I see you
You know I play fair, I'm Daddy Day Care
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Let's get past the nonsense and be honest
All the ones I sponsored clear my conscience
And embrace the kid, like my bracelets did
Uh, I’m from the era where the money come fast
And I'm down for the night
Said shes down for the night
I'm down on my line
Look at my situation, I couldn’t ask for more
Look what that kilo sent me, that Porsche is key less entry
That girl is high and drunk, I swear the rest is elementary
See that shit I pull up parking, make your neck snap the fuck off and
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
Down for the night
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
'Cause Rolex shopping is more exciting

The 911 cost 211
Watch looking like a jeweler's heaven
This is crime by design
Creep up on these niggas
You rather be more famous than rich
“Paid In Full” was more than reading a script
You ask me, Tyga looking like a genius
Gil Scott-Heron to the black poem
Woo, the revolution will be televised
Rolex crowns, I emboss your wrist
Diamond crosses, hang Takashi portraits
Street millionaires rub shoulders

This big face is in Blu-Ray
Hidin' choppas in the closet, half a million in the ceiling
I'm haunted by horror stories, wanna-be home owners
Did drugs with Donatella, Versace my a cappella
Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason

Then hang to dry like clothes line
Millions-millions in the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Yuugh, I'm tired, nigga and y'all gotta pay your tithes, nigga

This big face is in blu-ray and these black diamonds like boondocks

Never see me in Neiman's, niggas committin' treason
Soft loafer preferred, frost, organic herb
Niggas think they sit at the top, they just posturing

The addiction, both you and me, now take a seat
Every car got a fleet, every broad get a jeep
New bitch I been fucking might start a rap war
You niggas pussy not at all

I can’t be bothered with paying homage to forefathers
We don’t mourn for the dead nigga, we pour bottles
Started with similac powder in a baby bottle
Gator at my momma’s house, welcome to zombie land
Down 40 but a streak will have you square by night
Didn't bat an eye I at it, kept the poker face
When you get to heaven’s door they won’t hold a space
If you numb like the flesh on a smoker’s face
The Second Coming is in the second verse
They say I’m heating up, welcome to the flame, nigga
No matter the success, still the same nigga
Able to drop it all at 30 and be free to go
Only deal with divas on a need to know
And what you need to know is when you need to go
You can hear in every bar and every cadence
The last supper for you niggas now repainted
They know better, they know better
Won a gold medal
And a gold bezel

My teething ring was numbed by the nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with his jewels on
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?

I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rock a bunch of gold chains
Yuugh! This is drug dealer brilliance
But my tribe don't quest like love
And a team of lawyers to run the train on a judge
But instead, I chose Avon
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Blood flowing through my veins
Bitch that ain’t no paper, that shit fit in pockets
These Balenciagas, Philip Lim, the joggers
Look at how these watches, hold these diamonds hostage
We tumblers, we acrobats, we jugglers
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies, pies?
Yes, I wanna make
Versace bed and 12 thousand on my king coil.(God)
It’s lifestyle when you can’t live without it.(Haaaaa)
Wild world of Balmain and Balenciagas
This deep rooted it made mobsters
Now you break bread and we crack lobsters. (Push)
If you love me, please don't judge me
If you wanna place blame, then look to the puppeteer
Who gon' block the dream?
Who gon' stop the shame?
Walkin' a tightrope, ain't a life boat (Nope)
Got my hands tied, the power's above me)
This thing of ours is not broken
What's understood is not spoken
Don't judge me
Family, fortune, envy, jealousy
Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Hidin' is the only struggle here, Push
Just keep your lips shut, the zip, the zip stuck
The summer-
I love that flow
I buy you some new tits, I get you that nip suck
Just get your lips up, just zip your lips shut, bitch
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I buy you some new tits, just keep your lips, mhm, mhm
Started a new family, the condom done slipped up
Standing on the shoulders of twenty-thousand fiends
Combination locks to the kilo’s that I hold
From my high school sweetheart to fucking with hoes
Nigga, ain't much changed; in fact, things are the same
I’m the definition of shooter, gun of choice, the Ruger
Nigga, surprise, 50 back on fire
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Innocent faces with a shitload of priors
Pirellis on the street rolling like a steamroller
Bitches double-team when I have my sleepovers
This is tailor-made, drug dealer theme music
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
Ring, ring, a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
Both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took her phone number
Another bitch, ménage
Lipstick on my collar, Oscar de la renta(y)
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trendsetter, landowner
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
Half gold, we got a hand on it
Drug overlord, they put me over Lord
Mink was like Ocho-Cinco with the blonde streak
Lebron's on 'em, the coupe's Bond on 'em
I'm pushin' kilos; it's a pie-a-thon
Every bird got my talons on
Witch-doctor flow, you could say I'm cursed for it
Push!
Now that you’re focused 
Play in paradise
Bitches love to shop, levitate the mall
Who are you? We don’t know you
And I promise, I hardly see you
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Coming live in direct from Abu Dhabi
Noah on the boards
That had me hide it in the mattress, now got me round the atlas
Cabriolet convertible, careening in the coaster
Christian Louboutin, straps is like a holster
No corpus, no guts, no glory, no joking
All-Star we play
Representing all my niggas know I shared from the heart
Only chains, hi haters
Crew members turned traitors
New catalog gonna hurt you
Go on it, it's dark like it's curfew
Yeah, King Push on the way, yes
Blue moon, I rides by, yes, but I fronted every gram on it
Real money ain't shy, no lay it out and get a tan on it
King Push on the Pharmacy
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
It ain't right, but it's white and it's right
One man cowboy, speed limit timid
Lost 100 large on the last time we sent it
It ain't right, but it's white and it's right
While I get this dough
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
Baby, I got a plan
Run away from me, baby
...I get crazy
Run away as fast as you can
Man i'm about to get crazy
Run away as fast as you can
You could leave or live wit' it
And I always find, Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
I am just a short stone's throw from the streets
I'm no different than the priest, priest
They say that death comes in threes, how appropriate ('Propriate)
Rottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock hollers
The three of y'all too accessible
Santería!
Ha-ah, los ángeles te esperarán
Ha-ah, los ángeles te esperarán
Es el fuego que yo—
I'm no different than the priest, priest
I just place orders and drop dollars
Seen all the wrong moves, watchin' The Untouchables
We don't do vegetables, niggas get flatlined
Santería!
After long, afternoons good go
I bet when we draw blood, you niggas will draw a blank
And all praise, no jail bars can save
Hey, it's probably better this way
Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Let's talk this payola (Payola)
Sacred stories of home, they go
It's the code of Mamman Shata
Something only we know
Something only we know
Darken my doorstep, they told me the day's gone
Scared money don’t make no money
Scared money, they don’t make enough
You wanna go to war you don’t make enough
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS RIGHT? GIVE ME EVERYTHING (BOOM!)
They don’t want that type of beef so they wanna squash it
Scared money don’t make no money
(We ain’t never goin’ broke)
(As long as this Mexican borders out here…)
If I ever go broke, I’mma take yo money
Scared money don’t make none
And went German engineering with my brake drums
Stayed up for three nights, with raw little fix fiend
The slickest of bad bitches with good head that mislead
Sell it all nigga, then we ball nigga
Panamera’s and we playing leap frog in em
If you get what you earn, we belong in em
Goonie shoot up yo wheel you need May Gold money
Stretch my hands to you
Shiftin' the culture, they say I taint
Lil' Pusha T, my synergy saved lives
And mines on the way couldn’t wait to say it in song
I don't question God's love, 'cause every good and perfect gift is from above
Yeah, ughh
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Bring the noise (Bring the noise)
Get 'em!
Get the money and they bitches, bring the prize home (Yess)
Escaped clever through the foxhole narrowly
They kick dirt up on my name until they bury me (Never)
Push!
A nigga ice-cold as I'm freezin' my bezel off
I only speak money, I go mime on you niggas
The longest runnin' trap star street niggas nominate over all
All the watches get overhauled
They say the snake is the closest, remember to mow the lawn
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Now when the phone start to clickin', your words start to echo
Oh, my nigga, say it ain't so
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
So close niggas thought we had the same pops
Hearin' whispers, "it ain't adding up"
Tellin' all your cellies how come I ain't sitting next to you
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
It's like I hear you smilin' when you heard they hit the wall
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
But, sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!
Covered his own tracks, he didn't care that
Every move we ever made is gettin' stared at
She keep a lit 16, a network of typers
Fuck sellin' the pipers to get the baby the diapers
Benz trucker, all your mans want to fuck her
She get a nigga cleaned up too, you need a buffer?
All she know, if it's my hands, it's pie hands
Charcuteries
New jewelries
Nice with the Visas, passports is art
Who you think showed you that Chanel did the tube socks?
New body parts, they double Ds (You know how I do it)
Her mother sayin' she should be a nurse hurts
'Cause they man is locked up but still laced you?
And you know I need it twice, so it takes two
Fendi cross-body, fanny pack beige blue (Nigga)
I'm supplyin' the hits
Weakest niggas throwin' shots, I just lean through 'em (Blap)
Take a glimpse of my life as I walk through it (My jeans is heavy)
Catty-corner penthouse as I park-view it (We scatter big boy rise, nigga)
As I burn through this money, no thought to it (What'chu lookin' at?)
Move Heavy D (Dope boy shit); I should wop to it
I just wanna flip it
I just wanna sell it
A nigga got rich from what you snort through a straw (We supply the block)
The hate is so thick, you can cut it with a saw
Q-dog steppa, Stomp The Yard better
It's so obvious in my clothes you could smell it
Dope man, dope man
Around the crack of dawning
Jivon she motorcycle leathers
Husein bolt through these bitches then i'm done with them
I wake up, early in the morning
And ...tad it up, get bang in my truck
It was all good just a key ago
Still moving snow like it's 3 below
Chi town plug got the city jukin'
Sit them on a curb when I'm done with 'em
I picks her up, right?
She tells me: Oh I thought I saw you earlier
We are not peers, we are not equal
One of the few that can really boast, post-glory
A nigga still play chess on your checkers ass
One horse on the grill, the other one on the shield
Balance on the scale, I ain’t a Libra either
Grim Reaper, him cheaper, hemp chiefer
Been realer, pound sign, been trilla
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Hip Hop Weekly cover and a Rolling Stoner
Don't make us equal 'cause we shared a bitch or two
Like I can't see the scenes that you mirror in your idol
Ooh! Suicide, it's a suicide
Story of the sheep and the wolves I unmaster
Fifty in the liquor, unwrapped 'em
Unpacked, powder rise and it falls like Sebastian
Crab walk, back spin, tanner than my black skin
Oh how the day can be so long
America, you need a miracle
You gotta see what Chief Keef see
I say hey, sunshine
I don’t got no march in me, I can’t turn the other cheek
Being laid over ours
Metal detectors is where ours is
They call in the National Guard
From shore to shore, oh lord
Oh how the day can be so long
Oh how the day can be so long
The only thing missing is Seven Dwarfs
Funny snow white sprinkled off through my repertoire
They hopin' I level off
I only speak money, I go mime on you niggas
Can't limit the protocol, don't turn your motors off cause niggas motives is on
Lil jon (HEY!) Snoop Dogg (UH-HUH!)

Tell Santa what you want for Christmas
And what else?
And I want three ho's for the holidays
A lot of gifts for the seasons
Naughty or nice, party tonight
Boss lady, that's by tay tay

There's just one simple rule
Honey baby can't you see

Dance all night in Rome
And my Lear jet brings me home
It's all because of somethin
Honey baby can't you see

On the set, my nigga, I'm my own man
And I stays in my own lane
A lot of y'all niggas do sound alike
See, you can blame it on the drugs, and you can blame it on the music
While you leanin', now you fiendin', while you dreamin'
You bitches drinkin' lemonade, I'm the Coolaid Man

Smooth with the vocal tone

Shout out to ? and Michael Vick
I know the Eagles will be back next year
But don't even trip, cause Snoop Dogg is packin a cold grip
And take you on the mothership
And then they try to stop it
But you can't cause I'm hard in the paint
When I bust freestyles, make the suckas faint
It's all off the dome
Big Snoop Dogg and I'm halfway home
And that's how it go
Have a seat, come and kick it with me
But you know we don't quit
Went to the kitchen and I had me some chicken wings
And baby said "Dogg can you sing?"
That I just put on the top of my head
She say "Snoop Dogg breaking it down!"
I got the wraps and I got the snaps
I got the sack and he's got the Lac
Cosmic Kev, this is how we do it
Big Snoop Dogg coming through with the do-it fluid
To give you what you want, cause I know what you need
You thought I was gone, but I couldn't leave yet
She say "Snoop Dogg, don't worry about it grandson!"
And a BET, everthing is on cue, and you know how you be
Been doing this since I was about 17
And niggas 16, niggas 14, it don't matter
Drumming wit' a hunnid bands
Crack a bitch, hit the switch and make the back scrape down
Real sharks turn guppies, y'all drown here
When everyday to me is New Year's Eve, Swizzy the countdown (Snoop)
Snoop Dogg
It gets cold for a winner in the winter
For a rich Crip shit can get, Big Dogg, pick of the litter

As you groove to the gangster shit

Then I blaze up the chronic so I can get high
I promise I smoke chronic til the day that I die

With Dr. Dre
Hand me my pimp glass
I learned to G, how to C from L.O.C
Long Beach is the city, 20 crip is the gang
Tried to play the young homie, tried to take his cash
I step up in this bitch, they say "that nigga's a playa"
If I hit it and get it, quit it
So, I'd rather fuck with this all whitey then
You just make it, shake it, I take it
I'm so in love with the game and I just can't fake it
I just can't take it no more
Can you dig it?
This is some of that A-B-C R-I-P ooh-wee
Can you dig it?
Hey Snoop Dogg, can you give us a bedtime story?
Just another day in me old neighborhood
Swang them foes, bang them hoes
20 minutes later, I changed them clothes
I got his, hers and your bitch too
Kick back and watch your big homie do this shit
Crush grapes to drink fine wine
S to the N, double O, P
Won't you put it in the air one time
Leave shit with the model
Hangin' by the high school, blowin' in the trees
Won't you put it in the air one time
Kick back and watch your big homie do this shit
Niggas don't make or break me
Won't you put it in the air one time
Good evening ladies and gentlemen
{*scratched*: "Let's describe a certain female"}
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
When I start gettin pussy every day of my life
It really didn't matter what the bitch look like
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever
I went up in this big fat bitch named Treva
Ain't no pressure, later that semester
She put me down with her homegirl name Tanisha
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She brought some new tricks, flippin them squirrels
It's real in the field, no mistakin
Time and time again she would bring me bud
I'm on some other shit, I got a phone call
From the motherfuckin president y'all
He left his daughters, and a lot of cash
Major pimpin, out in D.C
They're standouts, you know the ones like Yvette
We fucked in the car, behind a bar
See I was taught by, and I was taught I
Better move on somethin fast if I thought I
See on some different stuff, I'm a different cut
Oh you wanna brag? I wanna brag too
Shit it's all cool, cause it was all good
It's a 90 percent chance she gon' get pimp juice
Now you livin with that ho and y'all got fo' kids
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
I to school from my moms apartment
My homeboy Dogg is chilling in a Benz
My sisters cute but shes got no gear
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
I get dissed like a jerk
I do it once I do it twice
And now there's stake with the beans and rice
I pull about a G a week, fuck school
Me and my brother bounced in the Benz
An automatic weapon cold sprayed my car
Doggz gonna get ya
On top of that I'm in it to win it
And all I could about was my brother
Dogg jumped up and began to run
Now as I left there goes the boys in blue
They shot down one, they shot down two
Doggz gonna get ya
Doggz gonna get ya
Ya see the moral of the story is this
You mix the two up you bound to get some drama
That's real
Its called dogs get lonely 2
Bow-wow
You can ask all my homies, all D.P.G. got tenderoni's
Now when we on the road trying to get this paper
Buy you a little something go to the movies too
If that's what you want to do, that's what you trying to do
Cause I got to get this cheese with my crew
You don't stay on me, you're always out to play
Smoking on that Doh' Doh'(Doh')
Here we, here we go again
My shit at the record store
Go ahead and blow it in, tell a friend
That nigga bow down to the new motherfucking sheriff in town
I'mma shine when it comes down
Most of the niggas on the block know what I'm talking about
Oh yeah that back gate is my smooth get away
Hop off inside the bucket
Cuz won't you let me know who got a gun for sale?
Shit, I'm trying to sell everything
East-side Longbeach City thing
(Chorus)
(Soopafly)
Baby what you say that Take-take?
A whole lot a, they got a pot of fetti'
East-side rip rider
And I still can't vote
Shut the fuck, and nut up on that white boy that called you nigga
Doh' rae me fah so la tee smoking on that Doh'!
Ayyo, ayyo, ayyo Quik check this out dog
Now if that nigga next to you got a rented car
She actin like that hair's hers but you know what's up
But guess who's callin', Pipedream Patty
Made that nigga park my whoride beside the alley
Tootin' on that cocaine, fuckin' wit that wrong thang
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew
That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce
Say they doin' too much, yeah nigga you doin' too much
Look, don't knock a nigga like me (why?)
When she went down on me
But my homie fell in love and he banked her
Back in the county wit the red ribbon on his wrist
Now when a nigga hit his girl and she don't hit back
And when the homey in the pen, doin a sin
And his girlfriend fuckin wit his best friend
Say she doin too much, hell yeah she doin too much
You doin' too much when you clutchin' on my touch-tone
Conversate for fo' hours, wastin' mo' power
You know she doin too much, yeah baby you doin too much
6, 5, 4, 3
Bigg Snoopy D-O-dub cuz

You through, you knew you shouldn't have done that
Cause all we wanna do is put the G right back in you

I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it

King of the coach, yeah, I earned my due
Pimp hoes, pimp clothes, yeah, I earned that shoe
I had you in the club for 10 years sipping slowly
To my shit classics and all it was was keeping it true
Feeling so alone blowing domes in the crap game
Got every type of car so now I just play the paint
Did it the G way, he say, she say
I gave life to the game and you behind on your bills
Ungrateful ass nigga, all the kids that I've fed
See me walking and that whole world doing it too
They play follow the leader, boss on the move
I'm hearing muthafuckas tryna steal my flow
Put me up on the game when I stepped in the door
Now, tell me, what's going on?
And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
But don't when it's time to get wrecked, checked, and ripped?
Ready to turn a trick and I can tell from his lips that my dick would fit
And once it all dissolves (to the left)
Like it is 4/20
Here's my metaphor (cookies)
You so edible (girls)
And it makes you wanna do it (to the left)

And once it all dissolves (to the left)
And it makes you wanna do it (to the left)
Pass the dutchie to the left
Pass the dutchie to the right
Like it is 4/20
Don't go 'less you go hard
Go 'less you go hard
You knew that it never would
Clarify ride, we bonafide dippers
ESPN, you know Sports Centre
With the skirts dragging, with the plaque in the back flaggin'
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon
First things first my nig', you better know where you at
Go 'less you go hard
Hollywood, downtime and back
Knew that it never would
Riding on the 405
Southern surfer Cali
Just left the Nico, bust a left turn on Pico
Athletes and even the teachers
First things first, my nig' you better know where you at
Yeah
I could give a fuck because I know we got two Glocks
Doggy Dogg is on the mic and like Karim I slam

Just mobbing  and [?] and throw up a pound, hitting motherfuckers up and you know I'm foul
Cuz' I'm a G for life and I go and C-walk till i can't see no mo
So just check my flow as I blow like the wind
I'm that nigga that they call Kurupt, these niggas talking shit When they in and oh they fucked

On some fat ass chronic and some fat ass dicks
You got everything you need
Yes I remember the times
So everything
I'll comfort you, give you all of me
It'll be you and me
Have fun wit' me while I run these streets
A boss hit, a boss lady, that's you
Float on the boat, just us two
I'll be, I'll be
I give you my love everyday
I was in the city 'bout mine (you know how I do)
And I knew he was a dog, had to put him on pause
But you really need a girl who understands you (for real)
It was like a blind date 'cause I ain't see it comin'
Yeah, my type, no stereo (my nigga)
I ain't speakin' it up, just givin' you a scenario (just playin')
So everything
It'll be you and me

We ain’t fuckin' with them Swishers
So pass it slow
Catch it tho', can’t scratch it tho'
We gon' blow, forever mo'
Yeah
And don’t let it go until you're wired up
Executive Branch motherfucker
And I ain't knocking a niggas hustle, it’s all a game
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
I do it cause I feel it
Vietnemese eyes tighter than ever
Fuck with the Dogg I’m biting whomever
So if you ever taste success, just pray it’s from a tall glass
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
Least it came with a few toys like a happy meal
Get away from me lonliness
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophmore
I guess everything I hate about me I see in him
I’m about to hit the ground
See it with my eyes closed
Girl you got me fadin away
I don’t know what to do cuz you have got me confused
We’re talkin on the phone
Love you right
Ain’t no other words to say
Girl you got me fadin away
Tee Wee when they see he a G so
That’s what my grandma say
Me and Dan Funk, we capture the fun
The vish, in the wind you blow
And I can’t go another day
Girl you got me fadin away
Long time, no hear from
Girl… you got me fadin away
You make it hard to stay awake
Girl you got me fadin away
Girl you got me fadin away
It’s so hard to stay wit you girl
And even harder to play wit you girl
One lil, two lil, three lil G's
Leanin' in the cut, 'bout to get popped
I've shot plenty niggas and cops, so fuck one time
Can't be fuckin' wit' my niggas while they makin' they dope
Now some muthafucka done snitched on me
Spittin' game at my homies about the good ol' days
To Chino, I see no reason to cry
I adapt quick, don't take shit from no nigga
Regarded as the freshest, by the way that I live
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
I'm in it like I spread it, if I said it, All gas unleaded
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
This is DJ EZ Dicc
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
That I love in the whole wide world
I gets loc'ed and loony
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Ride with you niggas like
All we got is you and me
I put a smile on your face, let me take you to a place
Baby had your fun and I let it do what it do
I like your flavor, you step your game up
Look at you, look at mine, looking good, wish you would!
I'm like a star is born, and I'm the next out
Make you drop, turn around, it's your world
Convertibles and Cuban links just like a prize
My  eye (First place), ooh
'Fore  a nigga show up, gotta envelope me
Since a lil' nigga, Dogg got it crackin'
Gold medal caught my eye, I gotta have it
More wins than Kobe and Shaq did
Who sold millions of records and balled?
Never slowed up, no no, not at all
From the streets of Long Beach, it's the Dogg
Always came in first place, I ain't never tied with y'all
First place (First place)
Chorus: (Nate Dogg)

Bought everything, I don't lease shit, G shit
Workin' out so the fleece fit, cool
I'm on that who-you-wanna-be shit
Hood politics, every real nigga battles that
Still standin' 'cause the way a nigga handled that
10 toes down, never actin' like a mark
Focus on me
10 toes, I did that, I did that
Big mouth Crip and the bitch niggas can't close it
I was chosen
10 toes, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
See these other fools but you can't see me, nigga
So all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin fingers in the air
Comin with a grip of gangsta shit for ninety-three
And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up
Now can't nobody see me here or there
Wherever I bails, I put it down all around
With the beat flossin off gold D's
I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
17 shot Glock cocked, so all nigga drop
Fly motherfuckers can't see Kurupt
Runnin em like Flo Jo, stranded on Death Row
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Check it out, it's Rage, ready for the breakdown
Album:  In Tha Beginning... There Was Rap
These are the tales that I tell so well
She was just like a doggie all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
I tell you homeboy if you get a piece
And just like Lori she's a real dick pleaser
I G'd this girl, her name was Tammi
She had a best friend, her name was Janet
One week passed, and I was in her again
Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta
I said, "I don't pimp, or gigolo
She was down on her knees, beggin to blow
These are the tales that I tell so well!
They said it was overwith for you
Shit nigga I ain't going nowhere
I talk some shit, hey hey hey hey
And we gon' toast, this that year
Funny style, Kurupt in the building
See we the shit DPGC
Bitches is crazy, they all on my dick
I'mma show you motherfuckers whats a poster G
You can study my style you can write down my name
Got all my money, all my hoes
Like what's crackin, and they know
Looking at these suckers pulling out they millimeters
See this is true we gray and blue
Word is on the streets, your beats gon' be delicate
(Now let me shake that shit man)
(For real, hmm!)
Niggas be tryin to get at me cos I be droppin funky rhymes
What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money
And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I'm takin off from the get-go
Cos I done been bombed on before and I'mma tell you, man, that's the worst
And I can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support
Gettin 18-point-5 percent, half your life
Shit, I love my baby boy and all
Cos, uhh, when you play in this game you got to be the real player
Will be detained or deceased
I don't be trippin off no nigga at all, no bitches
I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders
So just sit in your seats and wait 'til we come through
Until we do just keep smokin grey and blue
Drinkin my drink, smokin my dank
Countin my bank, uhh that shit stank
It's like thanksgiving without the feast
They got dogs on my ass, but I'm a Dogg
So I know how to alert and get wit dat shit
The dog run up on me I give him a cold
I'm true to what I do, I don't bang at all
I'm getting kind of greasy with curl on your neck
Well If Kurupt gave a Fuck about a bitch, I'de always be broke. I never have no MuthaFuckin endo the smoke, I gets loc'ed and loony bitch you can't do me. Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie. I have no love for ho's. That's something I learned in the pound, so how the Fuck am I suppose to pay this ho, just to lay this ho. I know the pussy's mines, Imma Fuck a couple more times. And then I'm through with it. There's nothing else to do with it. Pass it to the homie, now you hit it. Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me, and ya'll know that bitches ain't shit to me. I gives a Fuck. Why don't ya'll pay attention, approach her with a different proposition. I'm Kurupt ho, you'll never be my only one
It Ain't No Fun, If the homies can't have none
Guess who's back in the MuthaFuckin house, with a fat dick for your MuthaFuckin mouth. Ho's recognize, niggas do to cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo. What you gon' do? You really don't know, so I'd advised you not to trust that ho. Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch. Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip, now as the sun rotates and my game grow ups bigger. How many bitches wanna Fuck this nigga named Snoop Doggy I'm all the above I'm too swift on my toe's to get caught up with you ho's. But see It's ain't no fun, I'm my homies can't get a taste of it, cause you know I don't love it

For all the really niggas in the Cadillacs
We don't give a fuck, livin' in a warzone
Pistol packin' and we blowin' on this ozone
Different things I'm sposed to do, I gotta stick to the code
The first lil grinder was down for same thing
I only feared God in the days in the pen
Ski mask up, hit 'er with yo ass up
I'm ridin' shotgun in the fleet with Brome
I gotta hustle wars with me and we actin' bad
For lil niggas in the Cadillac
Do you have a fresh pair of panties on?

Callin all cars, yeah baby girl you a star

That we can call friends
We ain't no contract friends, we doggs for life
Hold ya own was the code that I growed to view
But Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case
A Insane with a 20, now we hell of a close
Life is much mo' precious
Than you'll think
It's so hard
Will you pick me up at all?
Will you pick me up at all?
And ain't too many of us that we can call friends
Get on up to get down

Snoop Dogg
Who's the man with that dance? Snoop Dogg
Here to annihilate you mark-ass busters
But if you give me somethin', it's got to be the sticky

With a car full of bitches cookin' grits like Alice

They all know the G with the Cutlass Coupe
Yeah, I'm straight loc'n, hangin' wit my folk

The boss in the building, feeling so cold
Put your hands up
I'm 10 shots in, that's on the real though
But your bitch keep looking at me
Before you come fucking with me
And cover everything, like a fog do
Bottle after bottle, nigga I'm turnt up
Since 93', on top of V.I.P
I do this for me, I don't do it for any slut
Like a b I don't do this for any butt
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
Comin out of your $2 mouth
He's a five-star guerilla Crip, with bars and stars
His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle;
And with this in mind, I'm gonna ask the Game Court
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
That I love in the whole wide world
I gets loc'ed and loony
So how the fuck am I supposed
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
GAME, that's my thang
I hit the flo' and when they go I make sure I grab all the dough
They threw away the key and now I'm a OG
And I ain't tryin' to get on swole so I ain't fuckin' with the iron
I got bitches bringin' me money and ain't a goddamn thing funny
My homeboy Devil from the HCG and Young Side Trey R.I.P
GAME, that's my thang
Keep them snitches on the sideline
It be the ones inside that do ya
Who ain't sure if he gon' get down
If them other two priors ain't brought up
And it ain't no rules when you in this game
And it ain't no rules when you in this game
GAME, that's my thang
Or represent yo' thang
I ain't givin' a fuck I'm still [?hugged?]
'Bout 3:34 in the morning don't even matter
We puffin' all night, straight game, game
A nigga didn't gave me none of this shit that's real
Wanna say what up to my momma, for givin'
These suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail
Is I, in the motherfuckin' S-5
So bang, like Snoop in "Deep Cover"
Dippin' down Green Leaf, I ain't got no enemies
It ain't a gangsta party 'til we go and dig Pac up
Hughey P. Newton with Air Force One's on
I ran outta gas in Long Beach, I'm stuck
Ain't no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck's
I'm on that Bulls shit, throwback Scott' Pippen
Moral is, my bandana hangin' from the left side
(What up Blood?) Yeah cuz, we just tippin'
Game, take the wheel and turn on 21st Street
We just - slip and slide out, we rip and ride out
The one they all wanna come to see, hoes loving me, you niggas wanna be (Snoop, Snoop)
Time to get this change guess I'm like Obama

Food stamps didn't come on time and the lights have been cut off
But look here
Now I'm that mothafucker y'all read about
You don't like how I'm livin, well fuck you
Them gangsters, they be fuckin' up the program
About drinkin' straight out the seven bottle
Shit, I'm that type of nigga that's quick to blast
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit
We decide to roll a week deep
Sweatin' all the bitches in the Daisy Dukes
We couldn't no play, from the ladies
True niggas on the scene with the triple beam
I want to fuck you too
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
Went under water came back up with a periscope lookin' at your bitch ass
I say: No cause you ain't got no clout, bitch get out

Pecan brown, she lookin' for the slim one
To give me brain like a genius
Give you my number to my cellular phone
(Girl you will never meet a gangsta like me
(Blaow!) I limp with my two step
Tall and skinny and always got blue on
Tell her husband that there's another man
A pimp from the Beach, gator shoes on my feet
Give you my number to my cellular phone
Play my cards right, will you take me home?
At the end of the night I'll take you home)
Snoop Dogg, playa-playa
I'm always with a bad bitch
You could say I got a bad bitch habit
We can our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
And sing a 'lil somethin for the ladies
When we doing what we doin in the back of the 'Llaaaaaaac
Is he, one of the coolest of fool on the flo'?
I whispered in her ear, "C'mere, you're ready to go?"
She like that -- you like that?

Take your mind, on a high
On the nutty danger side

Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces

Then I, spin the globe, putting my fingers on it
Then I zoom straight to [?], UK, Belgium, then back to France
Strap it/traffic[?], ten [?]s with the flyest beach
And then we fly over to the states with the cars we drive
And then we end up at the leopard nine[?]
Show you how it's supposed to be
Do you see the moon and the sun?
When it comes to freestyle, boy, I'm so cold
Get the money, bring it back
Steal the money, steal the show
It feels so good to know
You're awake
You're awake
It feels so good to know
I gets my groove on, I do my thing
Who's the number one (there's nothing new under the sun)
With the G  come to the light
It's time to spark up some ideas from theory and
When lightening strikes you know
All the girls that's in this room
It feels so good to know
You're awake
I dust off my knees
And get you gun out
It feels good my friend
A drug dealer at the same time I love to smoke
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
Extended Glock clips allow me to cop chips
Cold blooded killing for [?] this
Chop a shelf when I drop this
The hunger that I hold
Setting here wondering should I take it from his soul
And took motherfuckin' lives for less than twenty before
Because that weed from Magnolia still have a nigga sober
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Cause we smoke too much weed

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a hoe? (Why?)
Used to be up in them guts like everyday
So I figure niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr Dre
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news

Glass and metal in every direction
As long as we drop gangsta shit
Lincoln Continental

Graduated to a .38, now I'm hard
159th street is where i'm hangin'
To [?] and dogg carryin' heat? Nigga you bet
But they knowin' damn well they wanna defeat us and cheat us
Every corner that I turn and every city I'm in
Every time I set my mind to spit rhyme with my pen
I come out bustin' and blastin' in a Dogg Pound fashion
In this game I'm on my own with my back on the wall
You got a hunnid on it? I got a bad freak on it
Since everything on cuz I guess he got a hoe for a nigga
Tilted, leanin'
Hoes tryna get at a nigga, security screen 'em
We dem G's, just C's, no fleas

Worldwide, DPG, catostrophic, D-O-double-G, ya know
Outsiders
Ya know, ya know
Had not been for the Lord who was on my side
Back was against the wall
He heard my cry and rescued me
Don't take it for granted that we are here today
Never let a day go by and not realize
What the devil mean't for evil
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored
It coulda' been me
It shoulda' been me
Favored-favored
Favored-favored
I am blessed and highly favored
It's a C-Walk contest, who do it the best?

Over and over and over again
You're blessed going in
Everything you have is blessed without a doubt (he's blessing me again)
Yeah
Blowing chronic to me, it's like a tradition to me

Gotcha listening to Snoop and now you feel like you crippin
You got some hoes in ya truck and now ya ready to fuck
Cause ain't no fun, if the homies can't get none
Do you wanna smoke wit me (Do you wanna?)

(It blows my mind)
And that's for life my nigga
Haha, Gangsta Gumpo
Watch it, watch it - Daz is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
And there'll be no more waitin
You might be shootin, inna de place
To my bulls out in Philly, cause all they smoke is phillies
Now really, will he ever slip or trip
I spits the vocabulary to sinks MC's like ships
With my nocturnal vibes and editorial clips
I got a click, that'll hit you like a thousand volts
Listen and get elevated off the verbal contact
When a nigga gotta strive for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
In ninety-six, with a different approach on shit
When the Tek connects to ya
They're trained to kill, beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area whether I'm toast(?) or at home
So respect is what I expect, the money got me driven
.45 calibre Glock gat, gun, or pistol
When we bust, I let loose
I'm stompin, steppin, with my projectile weapon
And these MC's'll be G's
And who, wants to compete with Techniec
And what you say when I display
(Watch out nigga!)
Just bought a bitch a Birkin, she loved it (She loved it)
Roll around town with your bitch, lil' nigga
Blue Chucks on your motherfucking carpet (Carpet, ayy, ayy)

Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it (Ayy, fuck it)
Left pocket, blue rag (Blue rag)

Niggas mad I bossed up for years and I'm still lit
Just bought a Benz and I love it (And I love it)
Just bought a bitch a Birkin, she loved it (She loved it)
He got money, cuh got money
YG (4Hunnid!)
Boom!
In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop
Baby's a lawyer, her body's the truth (Cute)

Skin in game, church
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (Pimp game)
And to me, you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
Holla at 'em, Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang
And dedicated to his paper, Je-sus!
And if them law boys pull him over he won't freeze up
I'll take the stronger, you can have the weaker
And by the way I was hoping you
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" like my nigga Pootie Tang
Had to catch my breath, watch my step
It's like a art the way I articulate
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (Pimp game)
Would you lie to me? (Never)
Would you die for me? (Whenever)
Will you kill for me? (Yes I will)
You got to go see the wizard .. to get you some heart
That's got the game ... for them lames
Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (Pimp game)
Holla at 'em Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang
I got that bounce, to make her booty sway
Always in them stores, with major whores
Wet Cristal, you like to get wild
Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's
Understanding how I'm living, show them hoes how you winning
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
See me man, I'm nothin like you
I'm leanin' in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin'
Khaki's and them Timbs and them niggas with the platinum mouths
Thinkin' that they blessed by the actions that be comin' out
Just put the key up in it nigga if she 'bout it
You can have her and her partner, fuckin' with it for a dolla
But I would never bother breakin' out the Doggfather
Walkin' on the blue carpet with the Doctor
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
I'm livin' that boss' life
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money
Woman: Ya baby
Woman: Ya baby
Then pump your brakes, you hoes
You could talk all day behind my back, but won't say shit in my face
Carla, Darla, Charlene and Camina
But I could give a fuck 'cus all y'all my hoes
Back in the days when I was on the block
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
And tried to confront me at a club one night
Like Kiki did me, bitch changed the locks
And kicked me up outta spot
She said she needed a companion
While she was at work workin'
And fuckin with all her friends that was flirtin'
Bitch you a'int shit but dirt for dirt (biotch!)
This is a sexy bitch
Breathe it in, breathe it out
Itchy ga ga, you got bush
AK-47, not that train wreck
If it ain't the Cali then it must the hay hay
You got the woo wop sack, so don't start that
Relax and kick back as D.O.D. did
Now hit that, lit that, and bring that shit back
L.A. unified, add that up low
In these times, of hate and pain
We need a remedy, to help us through the rain
Fuck you niggas, think you can fuck with me
Make a pimp wanna jump back
Bitch, and fuck that
Tryin to break the bitch but you saying "I will"
So she could smell like the big girls
Make a nigga disappear like Jimmy Hoffa (Where is he?)
Watch your mouth, watch your mouth
It's a clear blue sky here on the Eastside (Eastside)
I'm talking big shit, holdin my dick
For you hoes to disbelieve (Hoes in amazement)
Niggas disappear all the time
Let's make a muthafuckin' movie
You know man
Ya dig?
Yeah
Damn, this shit sound low than a motherfucker in my earphones
As soon as the bass hits your dome
Shootin off rhymes like a pistol

I can't say goodbye (To the hood)
Goodbye (To the blocks)
I know since I've left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there if I couldn't write a verse
But if they think the old me ever left
I got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignored the shit
They say leave the streets but they don't really understand
CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
I can't say goodbye
Charlie: I can't say goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Banging for the turf, late night huntin'
Fighting these pressures in my life
But if they think the old me ever left, then they don't really know me
CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
Fighting these pressures in my life
They made me how I am, the music in the man
The say leaders streets but they don't really understand
I can't say goodbye
I can't say goodbye

Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Only left a ball I know you heard of me - wanna murder me
Now West Coast Mafia Regime and thug zellin' Nigga

Police – How did you get into rap?
Police – What would you call what you were performing?
2Pac – No!
Police – The next statement is a “Victim for Real” : “I really got my ass beat, I really don’t like police”
Police – That’s right, “after allegedly listening”: they said they were listening to your music

The StorySeptember 7, 1996, Tupac Shakur attended the boxing match between  Bruce Seldon and Mike Tyson with Suge Knight. After the match they assaulted a crip and went to Club 662 in the 1996 black BMW 750iL sedan with other cars behind also. At 11:15 a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac pulled over to the right side of Tupac's car rolling down the window and started shooting. Tupac was sent to the hospital and died 7 days later.
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed
This is Destiny, yes money I'm of running
The only DJ that can calm me is Constantly armed
My firepower keep me warm I'm Constantly armed
See niggas is false, sittin in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryin to be strong, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world til I'm gone, Bitches be warned
And then it's on, before I leave picture me
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do', with fo
Now I could make miracles with pimp hoes
Just cause I'm paid in the worst way? True!
Looking kind of good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy?
Yo, let's stop faking and be real now
Boss player when I ride out, that's right
They like me
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar
And I'll never turn down some Oreos if you got them
Double Stuf or Thin Mint
I want to be faithful
I'm a beast for they're treats
Head to feet, they're so damn sweet
Lyrical commando, (Let get it on)
I turn the track into a roman candle
One in the chamber
From the cradle to the grave
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And now they're saying I'm in trouble with the government, I'm loving it
I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it
Tell me baby what's your frequency
Niggas ain't ready to see me paid
They rather take mine
Retaliation takes time
Creating rhymes that so ferocious that the bass line
Niggas is scared, I am eternally thugging
(*machine gun fires)
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Comin' quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
I popped him in his knees and shot him—punk, please
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
And any motherfucker with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a motherfuckin' gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin' weight the shit is real smooth
By a crooked motherfucker named Stretch
Yeah, you don't stop!
Crooked ass niggas
When I'm rollin' with my crew, watch what crooked niggas, do!
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit 'em with
Criminal behaviour)

(Got him)
Yo 'Pac
Please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true
Ain't nuttin new, so I do, what I can to get through
A loaded AK-47 layin' on my hips so I don't trip
They make it hard for me to sleep
But now I'm pointin' the finger at police
And when the punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too
Fuck being tame, set a flame, time to aim triggers
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
That's my motherfuckin' brother, so Dave Duke, run for cover
They know they scared to see us sober
It's all up to you (up to you)
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; OOOH!
And maybe then you'll see the truth; OOOH!
Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
And nuttin but love for each other
That's when they gettin' petrol
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too
I'm gon' say what I'm gon' say
I'm gon' say, what I say
And we ain't shootin at each other
That's my motherfuckin brother, so Dave Duke, run for cover
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I'm gon' live how I live - how do you want a nigga to live?
Temperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga
I'm gon' do, what I do
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia
I'm gon' live how I live - how else you want a nigga to live?
I'm gon' do, what I do
... at thug mansion
Not knowin it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
I'll see you when you get there
See you when you get there
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
A healthy pretty baby found cryin' in the garbage
Walk your dog, she pees on the sidewalk
Everybody's scared, leave the body bleedin'
I see you used ta wear a laugh or grab her asses chokin'
Dangerous times, dangerous days, dangerous nights
Junior high school in '86 and '87
They had 38's, in '94 is Mack 11's
I think the world is endin', and AIDS is the plague
Their kids gone and even reach a man yet
Go to school, go to the movies, go to the club, go to the store
In these fucked up times they have no remorse in
No eye contact, we wanna lead them astray
So you know I'm back dro
I forgot it, I was lurkin' in the red zone
Yo it's danger time
Niggas all on my phone talkin' major shit
I'm more lost, runnin' from the police force
Open fire on them bitches if they get to trippin'
Go on baby scream to God he can't hear you
Go on baby scream to God he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast because it is time to die
Getting high watching time fly
Getting high watching time fly
Niggas is calling cops, people shot, nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped caring
Last night two kids shot while the whole block staring
Even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen, through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
See, I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
Staring at the world through my rearview
Now I was raised as a young black male
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
And all my motherfuckers
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
Gotta make my ends, so business on the undertip
Though hunted like a fugitive, those punks will never capture me
TEC-9 on my side, oh stay in back of me
So I be taken no shorts, when the shit get scandalous
I'm livin' like a mack, the narcist will be minimal
Born in the days of a Criminal, Born in the days of a Criminal
Bitch I'm a playa got no time to be bothered with
Havin' no babies in no long term relationships
Cause she'll be blowin' up my beeper before I shut the door
I took a puff had enough now, hold up
You think not, get dropped we can handle this
I never trip off your bitch cause she scandalous
(all in the days of a criminal) (born in the days of a criminal)

(criminal, criminal, criminal)
I'm hard, Jehovah said I'm barred from the pearly gates
Our father, my pops stuck up dope spots
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin'
Niggas keep stressin', the same motherfuckin' question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, Ron G, stop the break
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
See niggas is false, sittin' in court, turned snitches
I'm tryin' to be strong, they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world till I'm gone
Bitches be warned - word is bond, you'll get torn
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
I'll Roc-a-Fella like Shawn Carter
Hot rhymin', diamonds shinin', autograph signin'
My lifestyle is far out
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
Ron J ain't no motherfucking joke
You are appreciated
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
I finally understand
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I hung around with the thugs
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
And even though I act crazy
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
You say the words that can get me back in focus
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Mama... (Dear Mama)
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
We was poorer than the other little kids
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
Dear Mama... (You are appreciated)
Mama, yeah...
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
I hung around with the thugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Mama... (Dear Mama)
Dear Mama... (Just so you know, you are appreciated)
You say the words that can get me back in focus
And even though I act crazy
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
You are appreciated
Always was a Black Queen, mama
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
We was poorer than the other little kids
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Wouldn’t let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
Sweet lady (Always was a Black queen)
Lady (Always was a Black queen)
(Always was a Black queen, mama)
Lady, don't you know we love ya?
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
But the plan is to show you that I understand
(Dear mama)
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
(And dear mama)
Oh mama, I appreciate you
When I was sick as a little kid
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And I appreciate, how you raised me
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I love you
I need you
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
And I could see you comin' home after work late
Sweet lady, place no one above ya
(Just so you know, you are appreciated)
You say the words that can get me back in focus
And even though I act crazy
And all the extra love that you gave me
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?
Crichlow! (A 5991301)
Close five! Comin' down!
My homeboys in Clinton and Rikers Island
Mumia, Mutulu, Geronimo, Sekon
All the political prisoners
San Quentin (who can save you).. all the jailhouses
I'm with you
You're listenin to the sounds of..
I wake up early in the mornin, mindstate so military
Was it me, the weed, or this life I lead
Meet me at the cemetery dressed in black
So if I die, do the same for me, shed no tears
Come rush me to the gates of heaven, let me picture for a while
Livin fast, too fast..
Snatchin pockets lyrically, suckers flea when they notice
Got a cell at the pen for me waitin – is this my fate?
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinkin, me fall back?
Never that, too much tequila drinkin, we all that
Watch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livin
Saying, "Please show a playa love" - hold ya head!
The weed got me tweakin in my mind, I'm thinkin..
God bless the child that can hold his own
Currency means nothin if you still ain't free
Get the weed, drink a drink, read a book
Wouldn't be a damn thang without a woman
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was committed
What'd you say about my mother, man?
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I love paying rent when the rent's due
Cause when I was low you was there for me
(Dear mama)
Wouldn't be a damn thang without a woman
What'd you say about my mother, man?
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
And all my childhood memories
There are no words that can express how I feel
What'd you say about my mother, man?
What'd you say about my mother, man?
Mama told me there'd be days like this
Mama told me there'd be days like this
Mama told me there'd be days like this
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't eat
I expect retaliation in a hurry
Tryin to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
("When we were kids, belonging felt good..")
("But having respect, that feels even better..")
I see death around the corner, the pressure's gettin' to me
My homie told me once, don't you trust them other suckers
And even if I did die young, who'd care
("But having respect, that feels even better..")
("When we were kids, belonging felt good..")
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
I got homies that will hunt you 'til you drop
("But having respect, that feels even better..")
I see death around the corner
This is for all the real motherfuckin' niggas out there
If any of you..
I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead!
Cause they're bragging, telling the fuckers in jail yo, we just got pumped woo
Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin well, hell
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
A man of military means in my artillery
I really didn't believe until I got shot that no black person would shoot me
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed
"Nobody's, closing me out of my business"
I ain't in love with her, I just wanna be the one to hit her
Drop off and let the next nigga get her
Break a ho when it's time to make some mo'
And spittin' game through my mobile phone
"What you doin'?"
In a one-room shack, and, kickin' back
Daydreamin' with the nine in my lap (huh)
Before I go broke I'll be a drug dealer, a Thug Nigga
I keep my hand on my gat and stay cool, my attitude is shitty
Happy in the motherfucker, finally made it
I'm just tryin to make some money right
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker every single day"
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"Tis the season... to be servin'"
(Warren G fuckin' with that one nigga)
Trimmin' you from your winge and hit the gate, I'm not waitin'
Black fitted cap to the back with the Gap jeans to my knees
To my tactics chin checkin' in charge like chart, I want it all
Commence to lettin' off rounds
Then escape in the fog
Now they wanna really see
West side!
So pump curt curse, it's the curse of the pump pump
It's the mental temptation, mental assassination
And livin' from the lichter bro I'm ready to pull your plug
Point of no return and  now my life is on the edge
But I'm gonna getcha when tryna escape
West side for life
Biaaaaaatch!
It's time to run
So kneel to your fuckin' knees and feel this 45 fade you
No love, pumpin' slugs like I'm servin' dogs
With
DEATH ROW, WESTSIDE
Go into these niggas, to the motherfuckin' death
I take the figure of 30 niggas who all got me
Murder my friends, build a new posse
Bustin' caps at Jay Z and still avoid capture
I'm screamin' "Death Row!", throw my Westside, ain't no thing
We claim mob. MOB. if you be specific
We control. ALL cash from the Atlantic, Pacific
And get this. I'm hard to kill
Father. how the hell did I SURVIVE. these five shots?!
WE GOIN' ALL OUT!
Death to you traitors, shots bitin' through your bones like alligator
Payin' my dues. lookin' for miscellaneous infamous crews
But at times, I slip slightly, shit I ain't afraid to admit it
And it felt good, when I was young but playtime's over
And I bail outta jail
And to hell wit a peace treaty, never call it, cause it wouldn't feed me
US, THE FIRST TO BUST, WHO DO WE TRUST? OUT FOR MOBB DEEP AND JAY Z, DEAD IN
THE DUST
BUST ON ALL Y'ALL, GOIN' ALL OUT
(OUTLAW, DEATHROW, MAKAVELI THA DON OUTLAWZ THE CRIMINAL)

(Haha mobb deep, you lil young ass juvenile delinquent)
Puffy, BANG, you dead
Mmh, DIE, DIE SLOW
But I can’t help from walkin’ out just throw it away
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
I’m bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
What you won’t do, (do for love)
Do for love
Turn it up loud
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man, it just wasn’t me
I can’t breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
What you won’t do, do for love
To makin' promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin' on
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
You're gettin’ calls at the house, guess you're cheatin’
It wasn’t always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Don’t worry 'bout it, we can do it, now I’m under pressure
What you won’t do, do for love
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
You tried everything, but you don't give up
(What you won't do, do for love)
Sucker for love, sucker for love
Sucker for love
We had some problems but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
(Sucker for love, sucker for love)
Don’t wanna fall for it
I’m 'bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
You're gettin’ calls at the house, guess you're cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
'Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin', I’m a sucka for love
What you won’t do, do for love
What you won’t do, do for love
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry 'bout it, we can do it, now I’m under pressure
What you won’t do, do for love
What you won’t do, do for love
(Sucker for love, sucker for love)
(Sucker for love, sucker for love)
And baby bubba we gon' keep it on tha real
We puffin' on Cubans so it might get dangerous
How you feelin'? I'm up to dealin', ridin' like a villain
Makin' a killin', thrillin' the crowd wit my new hairdo
Who you be? You know who I be, young nigga
I'm Tha DoggFather
Uh c'mon

Let me flow on
Just remember when you do your thang
Like them white boy DA's was on the case
Do anybody in the house remember?
C'mon
When there wasn't no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
In and out of the flyest hotels
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need
And it ain't no party like this kind
Cause you can leave your worries behizzind
I Know It took me awhile 2 Reach back

True & Fakez I came across. Az 4 me

2PAC
How the hell can we make money off a nigga like 2Pac
But you was riding my dick, a little bit and wouldn't get off
Some is like a never have a friend like this
And we can handle it the way we must
Don't call me bitch
Let your fat ass pass little scandalous bitch
(talked to the niggas with the biggest bucks
Runnin' around sayin' trust a bitch but now I can't
Tryin' to make a million out of 14 tracks so don't start shit
Now you're mad 'cause I won't let you page me bitch
Don't call me bitch
I was got paid, but I remain true to my trade
I worked hard like a slave, to fin to rap to the grave
Second best for too long, critics I will prove wrong
So baby pick a winner, don't die and swear
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Some of you niggas are bitches too
(Don't go to sleep)
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
Don't fall asleep
Quit starin' at me like an infrared nigga
Pictures of plenty, sippin' my glass full of Henny
Hands on my semi-automatic kill for pennies
Scared to take a nap, it's a trap, a long maze
I inhale strong weed, then release the stress
Niggas pull out, when I say so (buck, buck, buck, buck, buck)
Efficiently I delete and flee
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
Yeah it's just six niggas tatted
At it like addicts, cabbage snatchers
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
But don't fall asleep (Don't go to sleep nigga)
You can't fall asleep my nigga
Not on Death Row
Fiend for hundreds so if I want it, I'm a thug run it
Robbin' bitches for their riches 'cause I'm straight pullin' switches
At lunch sharin' a stunt, with a blunt fulla chronic
Deep like them Jeep as niggas at the greet
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Don't go to sleep nigga
Money over bitches
Don't go to sleep
Chino-X kill..
You sleepin' on us
When my Glocks loaded them nigga will drop
Pictures of plenty, sippin' my glass full of henny
Scare to take a nap, it's a trap a long maze
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
The pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
And alligators
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Often, it's a young nigga, in a coffin
Seein' dreams in they sleep
Seein' dreams in they sleep
When I enter the first zone, worst known mic holder
Separated from his gun and bitch, and watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin', still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin'; Hell or prison
You mark, watch niggas fall when I call they name
Don't sleep
Dumpin' on motherfuckers at random, rapidly
It had to be a motherfuckin' murder, I'm glad to be
Sleep wit' his head wide open (head smokin')
Yolk the nigga off the asphalt
Addicted to my nine, movin' like crime through time
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep
When I hit the street, all I can see is the grind
What ever you do shawty you better think wisely
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
It's just so violent and it destroys everybody, it makes the kids crazy
The kids kill people
Let's ban all rap music
Why you think Nas screamin' Hip-Hop deceased?
No justice (No justice)
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Did I cry when they dropped me? (nah), can they stop me? (won't)
This rap game all we got left
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
No way no how we got to keep movin'
And puttin' it down
Through the music we speak to the blocks
Believe it or not
I'm buckin' at Corey Brooke he treatin' my niggas wrong
They gon' see who I be
Abandoned here in the zone
Cops never heard of ya
Catch ya man he dead with the fifth
Real niggas don't stay on they go
This rap game like a robbery
Enemies, sharpen they miss
Not an easy you wanna jerk
So baby are you ready to go?
It's number one at the top of the charts
For the hood the under privileged and oppressed
And we, sittin' clean in the latest edition
This go out to C. Delores Tucker
(God damn rap music I hate that)
(It's just so violent and it destroys everybody)
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
'Til we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
If I wasn't spittin' it'd be prison or death
And we can't stop
Don't you stop
Stop the music (You don't really gonna stop, haha)
You don't really wanna stop - stop
The only thing that we got
Cause at this every single day yeah
Don't stop
Ride by, with the block, I can't stop
Yo, I broke nights to get big, gettin' rope spot's hold it tight
Temp this
Who's next?
Scared of probation now I'm facin' death tryna hurt a nation
You don't really gonna stop, haha
Don't you stop
Stop the music (You don't really gonna stop, haha)
Don't you stop
To have a little time for me?
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get third degree
But to me, if you really trust me then it's pitiful
You should stop, for a while
To have a little time for me?
(not that I don't trust you)
It's time for us to take our separate paths
Try and be mature, I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
I'll wipe away your tears, come and hug me
You know that I'm emotional, you know me
I can't take the beefin' and the griefin'
And I can give you more when you mature
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
(not that I don't trust you)
Don't you trust me?
Got the munchies for some soul food
What's the cause of this excitement
One brother was a dopefiend
Cause I got caught up in the scene
Poor and helpless fiend
And I ran outside to see...
For them to see just who they would know
Almost cried right on the spot
And my heart could take no more
I felt a tear roll down my face
But she whispered
So I screamed out, someone help me
But I dont think they could hear
And if they did, they didn't care
To get their interviews
And they can't see the tragedy
Cause it ain't, it wasn't their family
And leave the scene the way I came here
Late night coolin' with my homies
Drinkin' Hennessey and cold brew
At the local barbecue
And there's nothing else to do
Said he'll spray and he's not jokin'
Now I could not walk away
Cause I got caught up in the scene
Poor and helpless fiend
(What's goin' on)
Another gunshot rings
(What's goin' on)
(What's goin' on)
Ran outside to see the big show
And my heart could take no more
But she took it in his place
I tried to make my way through the crowd
But she whispered
And if they did, they didn't care
The camera men and newspapers had come
To get their interviews
Cause it'll never be the same here
Though some people say it's crazy
At Dopefiend's Diner
'Cause another innocent dies
Free Dogg Pound territory
Snoop Dogg, di criminal mentality
Fuck wit Dirty Kurupt and yuh dead each way
Pack your heat, if you equipped say "hell yeah"
Wait these seconds then watch the microphone get blown
It's a clear blue sky and a clear blue day
Provocative footage of this lyrical abuse transgression
And unstoppable, Daz
Now what you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I gets to bustin you gets to duckin' (Blaow blaow)
Uncontainable, my mind state's so strainable
I'm a D.P.G.C. for life
I'm a D.P.G.C. for life
I smoke indo, and I sip cognac
Face to face, punk you can eat a dick
Cause you're all out of time, out of sight
With skills like a huntin expert, fuck around and get hurt
See me in black and beware
If it was on where you reside, what would you do?
Motherfuckers, yeah
Don't doubt that Snoop
• 50 Niggas

One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Show up and motherfuckers bow down, recognize
Who wanna see me solo? Catch Makaveli while he's sleepin'
Uh, duck or you ass out, drink 'til you pass out
Ain't scared to die, drunk drivin' in my glasshouse
Niggas is playa haters, label them my enemies—I'm dumpin'
Knew that God had a plan for me
Maybe I'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation just tryin' to get this
With the Pac keepin' the shot money, progressive
They don't really want no drama, I know your goons
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin'—I'm clever, stupid!
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this
It was at this awkward moment
that u and I became friends
and our bond was a memory
Worried, if you comin' hurried
I open fire let the Lord pick the first to bleed
Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
I can't sleep 'cause I keep hearin' peeps
You rather fuck with these other little G's
These motherfuckers wanna play we can do it all day
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Now, we're in '94, Niggas get bust through the do'
And put the freeze on these fake G's You know how we do
Don't make enemies with me, nigga
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
You don't see it
Young Thugs, fuck the drugs
'Cause y'all gonna get yo asshole tore
They tearin' patches out you niggas ass
We runnin' through, smile from handshake
"Your life has been marked by considerable pain..
No, but.. I.. I'm goin' for it.. I'm tryin' for it
And handle it!
We're in traffic
It's all good, uhh
Everything will be alright if you hold on
Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
My homies dyin' 'fore they get to see they birthdays
I'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on
Everything will be alright if you hold on
I know them ain't tears coming down your face
And when these busters try to knock you out your place
You stand there to they face tell em hold on, and be strong
Hold on, and be strong, this here is Black Man
It don't stop, til the casket drop
Imagine if we could go back
But we must have hope, quotin' the reverend from the pulpit
This ain't 'bout talkin' 'bout problems, I bring solutions
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
How do I plead?
C'mon!!
Bust in, talkin' bout, "Where is the quaaludes?" What you say fool?
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
So I'm hopeless
Rollin' down the freeway swervin, don't worry
Maybe if they tried to understand me
I had to feed my fuckin' family
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs
Got my mind on danger
I'm drinkin' hennessey
Runnin from my enemies
Blood in my eyes
But the closet thing to him, was a pack of M&M's?
Be the fly on the woodgrain, inside my Coop
Loc'ed and ready to get my slug on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust, I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me
Better duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - blaaastin'
Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
Steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin' loc
Get him, shoot that nigga {​​gun shot}​​ huh
Rich Town in the house
Can ya feel it motherfuckers go {​​gun shot}​​ huh
Rated R in the motherfuckin' house look out, look out {​​gun shot}​​

READ THE PAPERS (thug life nigga) (thug life), READ THE PAPERS! {​​gun shot}​​
But kicks no material from inside the heart
They fade away, fade away
I just don't understand it and frankly I don't get it
So if you lookin' for a fool, you can pass me
I'm giving emcees nuff styles
Bumping it and they love it and I'm hit like Razor Ruddock
Hitting it with the furious styles, and I'm paid to say
To Mister Sambo, stop and fetch your look alike
But there's a million fake, a million snakes sellin' a million tapes
Don't disrespect me, punk, I'm a citizen
We don't deal with tryin' to fade away
Never fade away (never, no!)

'Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Bitch you ain't doin' me no favors, fair exchange!
Fair exchange
Ain't no robbery
Fair exchange
Ain't no robbery
In bed naked you're so twisted think your legs breakin'
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last
(if I do you, and you do me)
(if I do you, and you do me)
Fair exchange, fair exchange
It ain't no robbery, it ain't no robbery
Nooooo, nooooooo...
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did
Soon as I seen her saw us playin' hide the weiner
The trot caught your eye when I walked by, I said, "Hi"
Got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange
Baby you can treat me right, we can do it all the night
You can get whatever you want, I got what I want and gone
And since you bein' laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Baby you can treat me right, we can do it all the night
(The things that I'ma do, to you)
Tell me about these fake ass bitches
Think you all that just 'cause she let a nigga toss her
You fuckin' punks, I hate you snitches
The game is deep, and thicker than a motherfuckin' jimmy
Lyin' ass niggas and you punk ass snitches
Lyin' ass niggas and you punk ass snitches
Lyin' ass niggas and you punk ass snitches
Oh you too nigga, don't think we ain't talkin' bout your punk ass
It's gonna be harder and harder to be a Thug in ninety-fo' (I can't stand fake ass bitches)
Break em off somethin'
They love to G a nigga young dumb and gettin' riches
Think you all of that just cause she let a nigga toss her
And call me when you're ready to bone, and it's on
A motherfuckin' mack tonight
Stay that stay strapped cause my raps is tight
You fuckin' punks, I hate you snitches
You ain't about sheiiiiiiiit!
Break 'em off somethin'
The game is deep, and thicker than a motherfuckin' jimmy
I can't stand it, hoes talkin' bout they got a man
So how about hittin' a motherfucker on my pager
Fly how I fade her, played her like a game of Sega
Lyin' ass niggas and you punk ass snitches
I can't stand fake ass bitches
I can't stand fake ass bitches
Break 'em off somethin'
I can't stand fake ass bitches
Lyin' ass niggas and you punk ass snitches
I can't stand fake ass bitches
Break 'em off somethin'
We learn a lot from the 60's like glaring 13 necks
Mainly the niggas get shot for flaring out their larynx
Make you wanna grab a gun and throw the all black gear on
But it's still a very powerful word
We need leaders, we looking at entertainers
Niggas get paid then they run away from the community
That ain't gangsta nigga, you the opposite of Huey P
Disrespect and I'm a give you a bar to save your life
You could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky
Stalk the stage with the pride of the panther
He's not gone, you hear his influence in pop songs
You'd see Afeni Shakur on Larry King, and motherfucking Dennis Miller
So we mourn falling stars, they still living all hard (We still here)
Now of course this was inspired by 2Pac Shakur
We lost our Big Poppa and our baby girl
When else in the history of this country
and flickering starlight
2 be loved by so many, so intimate
And my niggas say
Come on! Come on!
Who can I blame? The world seems strange at times
I'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse
And worse yet, with each breathe, steps I take, breathless
Unconditionally married to my gun
Nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
It's been nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Was raised up with a clock box
You can easy been a man, but you's a boy in your heart
Something worth dyin' for
Searchin' for fortune and fame
Stuck in this game
And that remains the same 'til the day that we killed
Nothin' but pain
Searchin' for fortune and fame
Does not mean we are not created equally
Is the true beauty in the tree
Or in the vast forest in which it breathes?
I find greatness in the tree, that grows against all odds
The rose that grew from concrete, yeah
The tree that wasn't meant to be
It blossoms in.. darkness, and gives birth to a promising pod
Does not mean we are not created equally
Is the true beauty in the tree
Among the evils of the weeds
I find greatness in the tree, that grows against all odds
Has been denied time to give 'em a try
Finally made it, now focus
The brothers or the sisters
They keep on screamin' 'bitches'
Oh bad now, look what we got
Miss Billy Badass runnin' round, packin' double Glocks, uh
We might trip, but I dare you tricks to fuck around with Storm
It's strictly representin'
Better get that additude adjusted 'fore I mash your spot
Sistas get they groove on
Now let me hear you scream
Let me see you throw your hands up
Only for the riders
For the riders
Let me see you throw your hands up
from different trees
does not mean
Is the true beauty in the tree
Thinkin' of ya nightly thigh so hold you tightly
Visualizin' figure, damn that excites me
Feelin' you heart beat, our arms are intertwined
Wantin' to kiss you, the passion raisin'
Close my eyes and visualize, it's you I feel
Its tryna to make my fantasy a reality
I just have to find this girl in my fantasy
It's the only chance to make my fantasy turn real
Damn, I can't explain it, the state I'm in
But she walks away, almost as quick as she came
I didn't really wanna do it so I accepted the facts
Sat in my yard, then I noticed it was nice outside
Rollin' down the avenue chillin' my way
With the incredible sound (of who?) Marvin Gaye
"Yo check this out," is what he said to me
But when she opened the door, I couldn't open my mouth
I mean damn there she was, right in front of my face
Except my name is Ryan D. and it's beautiful day
She looked me deep in my eyes and broke it all down
She had to get me, had to have me somehow, some way
Bodies tight and touched together as we started to move
I had my eyes closed now that she felt so soft
But when I open my eyes, my alarm went off
"What's goin' on?" I said
I fell in love with a fantasy
Man, it was sort of a trip, man
I can never tell a homeboy this, man. Yo, keep this between me and you, man. Nobody ever gonna believe nothin' like this. Alright man, I'm straight goin' to school man
Peace man. Yo, what?
My niggas crooked though it seems
From Crenshaw to 125, and Do or Die
Once I; commence my show rip apart foes
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff life
It's the Don Daddy with the Villain, who you killing
Oh we hate them, come verbatim with this cap peeling
You handle shit sloppily I drop a ki properly
Pop a collar, drop a dollar if you hear me you can holla
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff life cause you never know when you gonna go
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
Life as an Outlaw, ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinnin', I'm hell bound
I make it a point, to make my beat bumpin' warlike
{Scratches}
Mr. X to the you know me (Yeah, C'mon!)
Flip it like fake identities, stickin' it to my enemies (Enemies!)
The only reason I got foes that used to be friends
You say what? Speak up punk, I can't hear you
Pray for my downfall, talk like hoes
Like one monkey gon' stop the show
The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
They ask me how I’m livin? Haaah I’m a hustler
But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
They got me runnin' from the police, nowhere to go
We got the illest combination of this right here man
Ha-ha, uh man, y'all runnin' out of steam already?
That's all y'all got man?!
It go one, two, three to the fourth
To serve hot plates all across the Unified States
You better walk like a nigga on a tightrope do
Pushin' to the limit like Montana did
But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target, oh shit!
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
Who can I trust, got my mama stressin', thinkin' it's a drug bust
We livin' a drug life, THUG LIFE, each day could be my last
That's the consequences when ya livin' fast
With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
Flash light I'm buzzed, wasn't right like drugs
Ripped like a machete, my alias Makaveli
Niggas ain't tryin' to see me paid, they rather take mine
Spendin' and bustin' you thought it up, but you wasn't prepared
I kick 'em all day
And my motto, make Biggie Smalls pay
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you eye to eye
Expose my foes for being bitches
Lets get it on
I'm first to bomb, first there's the calm then the panic
The way my niggas strategize
Life long committed, I write songs to spit it
It's Death Row
You wanna bet, I make the bitch come straight outta you
Don't let me tell you what some real ass niggas would do
I want it all, fuck the talk uh
The Immortal Outlawz, you niggas is hoes but already seen it though Malc alias Amin comma E.D.I, drama is needy
So you gettin' stole on by, a hungry pointin' wantin' B.G
Y'all niggas know how we do
Tell me baby, what's your frequency?
You see I'm makin' proposals that's full of verbal indecency when ya meetin' me
Flash light I'm buzzed, wasn't right like drugs
Niggas ain't tryin' to see me paid, they rather take mine
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye

First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your side
And you dog your own rate [?]
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your side
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
Knocking all y'all [?] off your heads, yeah
Slippin' through my shit wonderin' what hits it get
Even before the flicks I was always hit to flip the script
I freak the funk for the trunks, pop the pump on the chumps
Dum diddy dump, love to thump
Leavin' niggas with Plumps, smokin' blunts and skunks
Or get done by the worst of our trumps for fun
Flex, flex flex
Straight serve, what a herb, kicked to the curb
Bet you can't budge with the rough niggas
So why would you wanna play a test
Rep with
Ayo, spark, split fifty niggas
Ill shit they keep holes on the deals nigga
Attackin' niggas like shit list with quick hits
Strictly representin' for the motherfuckin' fuigitive [?]
Them niggas can't be fucked with
'Cause my niggas ain't afraid of flexin' you feel me
If not spare my heart today and I shall recover before forever
And if my doubts and ?'s upset u, forgive my fragile heart
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Forever young, I want to be forever young
But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crashed
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Yeah, you got the Live Squad in this motherfucker
Now they after me, prowling for a niggas bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Some niggas need to feel me with a passion
(Yeah 'Pac, fuck that, still hittin' 'em up with
And after she's crossed out
Pickin' pockets with a razor stoppin' Russian rockets
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
MAC-11 blaster, and I run faster
A lot of fuckin' bodies will drop
KnowhatI'msayin? Squad in effect, YG'z in effect
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
Fuck the cops 'cause my gauge gets me... PAID
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now your mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffin' blunts
Test the rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
who lost her son 2 a racist society
with the blood of Malcolm in my veins
Yeah
Don't stop (Once again, once again)
West Coast
Now all my bitches and my niggas
Well it's that slow flow, D-O-double-G, nigga
Do or die (Yo)
Wave your motherfuckin fingers in the air
Coming with a grip of gangsta shit for ninety-three
And let me and my Dogg Kurupt fuck shit up
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
C'mon
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
I know, death follows me, but I'll murder him first
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Hahahah yeah
I love that ghetto shit (that ghetto shit)
For the fame (fame) The notoriety
To have everybody eyeing me
I'm making up for all the times, that I floss to be lost (floss to be lost)
Remain the same, since the day I came (fame), will never change
Without the gloves
Full of common blunts unconditionally married to my gun
Searching for fortune and fame
Some niggas be backslidin', some niggas fall off and go into hidin'
Then be gettin' disrespecting O.G. peers
Gotta ride with two twin Glocks, gotta sleep fingers on triggers
2Pac, freak me!
I want to be, yo, let me fuck that nigga down
Let's be friends, where my niggas' at
Approach you and post a minute, yeah
As you pass bye winking
Through with that scandalous shit
Acting like your shit don't stink
Check my resume, sipping on Cristal and Alizé, puking
Picture countless options, was it prophecy
Clear as day, visions on top of me
Scream my name because, baby, it's delicious
Got a weak spot for pretty bitches
You'd probably hate to see a real thug with vision
Why have you changed
Come on, get your cash on, let's get paid
I don’t wanna be your man, bitch
What you crazy
Yo let me fuck that nigga down
What’s that?
(Set it off, set it off)
(Where my niggas at)
(Let's go lets go)
Currency seems small, I need companionship
There's need to front, let’s be friends
I met you and I stuttered in passion
Every time you pass got me checkin' for you
Hardcore, starin' and watchin'
Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Baby long strokes
(Where my bitches at? Show me where my bitches at)
(Thug style)
Westside in this motherfucker
Be friends, tell me where my niggas at
Make money, take money
And uh, I started out dumb, sprung of a hood rat
But nothing changed, I was stuck in the game
Niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
We break bread, now we thug brothers
A war they ain't ready for it
Hustle like a crack fiend 'til they catch me
Heed, from out the bible I read
See the meek shall inherit the Earth
Now what'cha gonna do?, when my niggas come for you
Tell me now what'cha gonna do?, When my niggas
But it's the timin' nigga
Now what you don't know is I got 16 point holler
Where's yo buster ass crew?
When my niggas come for you
u and I have perfect hearts destined one day 2 Be
Ha ha ha… hey man fuck all y'all… fuck all y'all
I got problems, ain't nobody callin' back
You can throw your middle finger if you feel me, loc
And when you stuck, where the fuck is all your friends?
Fuck all y'all
"Thug For Life" sprawled all across the wall
And all about my dollars make me wanna holla
Drop an album, sell a million, give a fuck about tomorrow
"I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
Fuck all y'all
Quick to socializin' with the baddest bitches
I'm seein' death around the corner
I'm bumpin' "Gloriaaaa," doin' 90 ‘cause I wanna
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
Fuck all y’all
That is right, I don’t need nobody
Fuck the bitches, the tele news, New York Posts, all those motherfuckers
Now, I can make it happen
I went from rocks to zines, writin' raps and movies
Now, could you picture my criminal status at its fuckin' peak?
Even the baddest be gettin' murdered in they seats
World mob figure addicted to these fuckin' streets
Niggas ain't killers so they hidin' (Why?)
Livin' my life in the fast lane, gettin' fucked by the past
Got my mind on my cash
Come put your hands up in the air!
Back off, I hit at everyone of you homies
You can bet your last dollar, I'll dick 'em and holla
For my profit pick my Glock up
Outlaw riders, mash up on the gas pedal
Now I want to do it too, ooh, ooh
Can you picture me stickin' niggas for they watch and chain?
I've got a brother, don't rest and he keeps some drugs on him
I keep my mind on my money, and my money on my mind
With my back against the wall, like I'm runnin' outta time
Screamin', "Thug Life, bitch, fuck 'em all!" and die for 'em
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Back off, I hit at everyone of you homies
Nigga, we Outlaw riders
Don't give a fuck if you love us, we thuggin'
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Where the fuck do these niggas live where all this shit be goin' down?
Undercover tactics, leave my enemies dead
Bust it, I took apart your whole crew, lack heart, I ain't concerned
Tell 'em all to let the games begin, we havin' war games
Got shot 5 times, got out of jail on bail
(Background while Chorus:
Sold more records then all you trick muthafuckaz put together
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
You stupid, you fuckin' idiot! (drunk ho)
Currency seems small, I need companionship
So why you hesitatin', actin' like yo' shit don't stink?
Cream dreamin', motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
He broke and I smoke daily—baby, let's be friends!
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends (Cash makin' hoes)
Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Me and you, one on one, picture countless options
Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me
Far from a crush, I wanna bust your guts and touch
Back to you, my pretty-ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs, now let me in between as friends
I got her ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
You got me high, let me come inside!
A bad seed turned good in this world of G's
Baby got me fantasizin' seein' you naked
(Throw yo' guns in the air!)
Friends… (My ghetto love song!
Let's be friends (Where my niggas at? Where my bitches at?)
Where my people at? Show me where my people at!
Be friends, tell me where my people at
Let's be friends (Get your cash on! Let's get dough!)
(C'mon, get your cash on!)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (C'mon, get your cash on! Let's get paid!)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Make money, take money!
Still elusive, but exclusive's what I give you when I kick it
You can bring that bitch, but your whole click will still get treated shitty
Nigga, if you was half the man your bitch was
My phone's tapped, so I had to send word through my lil' homies
Shit, this is what you get, for fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Fallin' legends clutchin' chrome three-five-seven
Learned my mathematics skills from real drug dealers
No need for ambulance, baby, bring the black hearse
Should've never fucked around, buster
It's what it sounds like, ding ding ding..
FUCK THE POLICE
And the punk police can't fade me
But right now
And my brothas on the block better stay strapped
Case you can't see
Until then, RAISE up
But be thankful that you livin bless
High till I die
Thug for life
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Lettin 'it fly
One way or another you'll be givin' it up - hugh
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Lettin 'it fly
Interview [referring to playing a cop as an actor]:
I told the judge I'm in danger
Fuck the world!
They tryna say that I don't care
I woke up screamin' "Fuck the world!"
They're tryna say that I don't care
Have I lost control or just another soul?
Sippin' on 'gnac as I sit back, life as a big mack
Brothers come up and say "you did that?"
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
Nigga, Fuck the world!
I been through hell and back and if I fail, black
Some of you niggas is bustas, you runnin' round
With these tramp-ass bitches, don't trust her
But don't cry, this world ain't prepared for us
Fuck the world!
I woke up screamed "Fuck the world!"
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. Fuck the world!
We ain't dead yet
From hustlin' and bustin' them rhymes
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
I'm still rollin' my bucket but I bought me a Benz
Only me inside the cell, straight locked up in this hell
Pick a reason to hide from all the niggas that die
Act like you know when I creep real slow
Niggas don't know my style
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
(Who's that?) A real playa named Eazy
But I don't think so, coming if your loco
(Hook): 2pac
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
(2Pac Collision)
I'm caught up in this sickness
Wonder if they'll catch me
Should I shoot his bitch
Don't wanna commit murder
Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune
Got no time for cops
Who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin trigger happy
Tryin to find my stash
Whip out the nine
Now I'mma dive and pump your ass
First wrestle with these, mice
Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little, mices
And fuck five-oh, blaow blaow
Dear mama
Your baby would be dead at 16
They tell me the preacher's there for me
And how can these people judge me?
I never got to be a man
And to my homies out buryin motherfuckers (Please!)
Steer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers
Cause once they got you locked up
These cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime
I kept it deep inside
The brother in my cell
When you're black
And you're trapped
In a livin Hell
I shouldn'ta let him catch me
Turn old and cold
My mama prayed for me
I take the breath from your jugular
until u came along
Hand me some of that liquor
Time to get my drink on
Time to get my drink on
Time to get my drink on baby!!
Time to get my drink on
Time to get my drink on
Time to get my drink on
Time to get my drink on
Time to get my drink on yeah!
Time to get my drink on
Come on come on
I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Pull the trigger kill a nigga he’s a hero
It’s time to fight back that’s what Huey said
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
Things will never be the same
Aww yeah
But some things will never change
It’s war on the streets and the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
Crack you up and pimp smack you up
And I never get to lay back
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat that’s the way it is uhh
Those who wish to follow me
If I could recollect before my hood days
I stop and stare at the younger
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I feel His hand on my brain
Without the sound of guns
Https://genius.com/18627661
My heart goes to 'em
And nowadays things changed
I hope we'll see the light before it's ruined
Cause that's the life when your living in the
Ghetto
From outta the frying pan we jump into another form of slavery
I say ghost take control drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from everyone
(Chorus, Akon)
Ghetto
Ghetto
Ghetto
Cause any day they'll push the button
It ain't about black or white cause we're human
I make mistakes but learn from everyone
I feel his hand on my brains when I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
They try to figure out what's on the mind of a brother when he's cursing
9 out of 10 you'll find the problems, time to take a listen and see what you could do to solve them
So think about it... why 2Pac hit cha, hit cha with a little ghetto gospel
Used to roll in the back and do drugs a lot
Lord can you hear me speak?
It's ok, its ok, it's ok
It's ok, it's ok, it's ok
Makaveli
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Just sell me your soul, and live the life (of a ghetto star)
Laced with game, practice on takin' pain
Street smart, proficient, intelligent
And keep suckers hittin' 'til snitches start smellin' it
M.O.B. related, one mo' nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth
Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears
His family, shit!, ain't nothing left to be identified
Why, I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass
Label me a success, I made the switch
An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star
Hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip
No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down
Straight to the morgue cause I plan on, shuttin' shit down
Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga shoulder
And a vest couldn't protect that flesh
I guess they heard that I got them birds
Luxury livin' lavish, with dreams of dyin' rich
And gettin' down on these snitch bitches, protectin' riches
Live my life as a ghetto star
(spank bitches ain't new)
Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin problem
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Daaamn, don't get me started
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-0) I daydream about the dope world
Snatchin drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
A seven-deuce full of niggas goes by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
A Mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do
And then we'll be ghost
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
FUCK THE POLICE NIGGA!
Bend over
Just rollin' (What's up Snoop?)
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
Laid back, with my mind on my money
Now this type of shit happens all the time
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
Just rollin'!
Laid back, with my mind on my money
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Lemme hear you say "Death Row"
(Death Row)
Say "Death Row"
(Dogg Pound)
Say "Snoop Dogg"
I fucked his bitch and sold five million
That's how we do it, you know the playas is on the West side
Fat motherfucker Biggie came into the game, tryna cross a nigga
He ain't got shit to say
Snoop runnin' for president, he representin' the gangsta out here
Cardboard, man im just trying to be friend but
Give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC
I ask cardboard for a damn account, but the nigga said "no"
Give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC
Give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC
Give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC
When I was alone, and had nothing
No one could help me.. except God
So when I'm asked.. who I give my unconditional love to?
Rest in peace to my motherfucker Biggy Smallz
The other day I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Sayin' shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
Money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
I can see 'em in my head – pow!
And if I die, will they all shed tears?
Paranoia got me lookin' in the mirror
See, I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
All the young motherfuckers that was took in they prime
Yo Stretch, Biggy
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock-a-bye?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, Uzi weighin' a ton
God bless the dead
Who think they got me
I'm on some Superman shit now
They shouldn't have shot me
And God has blessed me with the power to be hard 2 kill
Fuck everybody
Blazed up on top of my man's roof
Moon motherfuckaz 'til they feel me
Verse 02 Rakim :
Tonight if the Rs on the mike
There's a slight chance
Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
Now it's a HABIT
Beware of overdose
He'll rest in peace wit' 'em
Was the rhythm
u leave my side till the moment u return
Just 4 the feeling of joy u bring me
(Ray Tyson)
Had the hoods' toughest team so I just had to win
Tried to say we cheat, because he got beat
Kick it - it's just a day in the life
Tried to get outta my bed, but I can't move
Ya see I'm stuck to my matress like crazy glue
Got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin'
So I'm askin' who is it? and the answer shocks me
Him and Dizzy had been waitin' for me
I started rappin', girls started clappin'
Girls on my tip but I really don't sweat 'em
We hear the introduction, the audience is loud
But there's a whole crowd of people at the limousine
Roc is signin' autographs makin' girlies dizzy
Crowd sweatin' Strictly Dope cause we're gettin' busy
Suckers wanna battle us, we move in silence
And more I try to sit up, the less I seem to get up
Just another way of livin' a day in the life, kick it
A girl start dissin', and I scare her!
Rap is my forte and my recreation
Girls wanna kiss me, suckers wanna diss me
The ladies desire, emcees admire
It's not hard to understand, it's just a day in the life
I remember when you were lost
But then your soul was found
But with this you forgot about me
I pray to God it stands
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
21-gun salute, dressed in fatigues, black jeans and boots
We shook Dre punk ass, now he out of the closet
Lovin' how I got you niggas crazy
Against all odds, hopin' my true motherfuckers know
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love
I'll destroy everything you touch
Last words to a bitch nigga: "Why you lie?"
He did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we ridin' for that
Ayo, Nas, your whole damn style is bitten
Read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
To the truest shit I ever spoke
Representin' to the fullest, bein' soldiers with military minds
I just remember what you told me
They say
Pictures of me in my final stage, you know mama cried
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
Then bring your big bad ass to California, 'cause we ain't hard to find
Watch 'em pause as I pull my strap out my draws
Movin' Dodge van, fifty rounds in the clip
Some may call me bootsy, but I call it timin'
'Cause a nigga steady plottin'
Playboy, what the fuck is a proof without the trauma plate?
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for if you gon' hesitate?
But now, my Glock be so judgmental
Back seat of a rental
If your gum bleedin' and you needin'
Heavy in the game
To the left, to the right
I had respect for you lady
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
Leave your number on the cabinet
Cause I have never met a girl
So how the fuck am I supposed
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
Why don't y'all pay attention
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
(I can't hear you, sing it)
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
But see it ain't no fun
Cause you know I don't love it
I don't love it
Never did, boo-boo
Something for my niggas to ride to
Something to get your money by
Gotta be strong, no matter what they do they can't break us
Cause in my hood they
Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
These is the worst days
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was
And even though I had
Dear Lord can you hear me!!
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
All I could see was my mama's eyes
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
And even though we G's
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win"
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
‘Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
Airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars....
Wish right now, wish right now
I could really use a wish right now
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga! I’m comin'!
Ah, yeah! Hahaha (Yeah)
It's all about you, one time (I'ma say it's all about you, baby, yeah)
You probably crooked as the last trick
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Every other city we go, every other video
I love niggas ‘cause we comin' from the same place
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Yeah, nigga, it's all about you
It's all about you
Every other city we go and every video
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
(It's all about you)
Every other city we go, every other video
Where my ladies at? Where my ladies?
Turn that shit up man!
Everybody!
You probably crooked as the last trick
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin’
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
Every other city we go, every other video
I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah, nigga, it's all about you
Every other city we go, every other video
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too
Gold digger, cold diggin' a gold Rolex
Just when I thought I'd seen it all
and I Knew from the First glance
your eyes attracted me First
and kiss with my Heart's intentions
and the initial Blind Date First impressions
and this was CUPID's blessing
(It's all about you, one time)
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, ‘cause this is all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
(This ain't just for the ladies)
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
It's all about you
Ah, yeah! Hahaha (Yeah!)
Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you
You probably crooked as the last trick
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
Addicted to the things you do
Yeah, nigga
How can I tell her I'm a playa? And I don't even care
No matter where I go, I see the same ho'
It's all about you
Drinkin' liquor, kissin' to help you know me quicker
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same..
Motherfuckin' OG
I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
Hey, to my nigga 'Pac
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
(Live my life as a boss playa, 'cause even gettin' high)
I got bustas, hoes, and police watchin' a nigga, you know?
(Live my life as a boss playa, 'cause even gettin' high)
I know y'all know this is Thug Life, baby!
Ay, you know what?
Straight to the depths of Hell is where these cowards goin'
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
'cause all I want is cash and thangs
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
(Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)
Do it, do it, do it!
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin' Jehovah
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question who's sane
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I'm in Jamaica sippin' daquiris, no doubt
I can't tour, fear of catchin' cases, litigation
We claim mob, M.O.B. if you be specific
We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Was ridin' with 'Pac, but when he died they went pop
I ride or die, but these other fag niggas be bitin' this
It's all from my heart when I was writin' this; all out!
We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out
Speak up or get treated like you comin' to kill us
Frontline soldier, 'til the Heavens call me
Holla back, right back, and watch your mouth
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Now it's 1999, it's a different grind
Does this love deserve 2 exist without a title
because I chose 2 let it grow
People tend 2 choke
that which they do not understand
Take ones adversity
The next heavy weight champion of the world
I won't deny it I'm a straight rider
Every boxer with a pair of gloves
Here's a man from the makings of a thug
A lethal weapon mind sharp
And in my heart there's a wish
Now once a high school drop out
I won't deny it
So why you suckers keep boxin' me
Plus you be boxin' for us homie
Constantly, money over bitches
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
(That's all you niggas got?)
Got the police bustin' at me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
Question my methods to switch up speeds
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Got the police bustin' at me
You don't wanna fuck with me
Oh, that nigga's body. I just wanna snatch his clothes off and just do him
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
These niggas is jealous
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
But they can't do nothin' to a G
and I knew from the First glance
your eyes attracted me First
but you reeked of sultry confidence
and 4 that moment we erased the tension
You don't wanna fuck with me
You don't wanna fuck with me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Got the police bustin' at me
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)
My attitude was "fuck it," 'cause motherfuckers love it
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
So open fire, screamin' 'kill me,' witness my steel
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Got the police bustin' at me
Got the police bustin' at me
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless
And reminiscin' bout them niggas that murdered my buddy
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next, who can I trust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin', two to the head
I'm under pressure gettin' drunk, somebody help me
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
They wanna bury me, I'm worried, no need to lie
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness
Well Hell can't be worse than this, 'cause I'm in Hell now
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Or Do you wanna live forever?
I ain't scared to die
But tomorrow, I see change (heh)
Children bred with foolishness, cause no one cares
But tomorrow, I see change
Tomorrow...
And tomorrow
Scared of being outcast
Tonight I lay my head down
Built on spirit, intent of heart
And strong because of pride
This one is all about love!
Cho!
Me no have nothing if me no have you
Remember that I still love you!
Me pray the day that you say you want me too
YO!
But to keep you, I'll do ALL it takes (anything)
Give me a chance fi show, and I'll show
This is not a flo' (flo')
Can we stick to the red cross?
Prepare to die or say you want me too
It's not 2Pac or that nigga Dr. Dre
That's why so hard to find me
Choo-choo, bustas, it's a must, let me bust, let me bust
Niggas don't hear me though, baby
It's Warren G endo I'm kinda crazy
Rich could give a fuck about a tramp and a hoochie
I hang with niggas from the block like 2Pac
What you wanna do is try to keep him locked
'Cause it's all about— makin' money
We went and got some Tanqueray, nigga, we ain't no punks
What we do, we takin' money to the bank
'Cause this is all in the paper's
Just niggas like to talk a lot, that's what we see
But buck it all up, 'cause I'll be ready to throw 'em up
'Cause a mack's gotta do what a mack's gotta do
But when you do, you won't be with me
So fuck a motherfuckin' bitch
Your heart ceases to work, and your soul is not happy at all
The river.. will flow forever, as long as.. you are with me
Up out of there
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
And I can make you famous
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
It's like Cuzz, Blood, gang-bangin'
You doin' your job every day
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
Enemies get beside me, flows go deep as Poseidon
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin' your fake smiles, plastic tears
Killin' busters is my motherfuckin' job, him or me
From this cell to that cell, (As the world turns)
Ain't no frontin' me I see my fucking soul, right in front of me
For these weak motherfuckers, my heat street suckers (Weak ass tricks)
Got a lotta G's on the way now, Marcy and paydown
My niggas blownin' up, getting paid now
Precision in my favors, unanimous decision
Fuck a religion dead on collision with the walls of prison
A street mercenary, lieutenant penned it
It's drastic, niggas'll set you up for the casket
That real shit!)
For this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns
Which one of y'all niggas out there gettin' money out there
All these niggas tryna' get his advice but they swallow us WHOLE
I take yo' soul nigga lost CONTROL, is ya' bad and BOLD?
You Die Now (Outlaw Riders)
Tha Outlawz, Ghetto Stars, Makaveli The Don, YES
Death Row gave birth to a New Seed, Makaveli Records
Feel Me Now, YEAH (Especially With Mobb Deep)
I'll be there to bless you
But you can’t, you can’t give up
Now here’s a story ’bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
Lord come and take me
'Cause they win when your soul dies
Baby don’t cry, I hope you got your head up
You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be
You need people like me..
Ain't nothing separating us but ma MAC - 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me, n*gga
Race me, n*gga in a high speed chase with the law
Everybody gotta die..
I'm starting to lose hope, it seems everybody's on dope
Mama told me to leave, cause she was broke
Alone, on my own, I'm a criminal
I got nothing to lose, and something to prove, what do I do?
Everybody gotta die..
(You all a bunch off f*cking a*sholes)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Pray to my God everyday, but he don't listen
I'm thirteen, can't feed myself
Wish he would've hugged me too much like him
Where did I go astray? I'm hanging in the back streets
Running with G's and dope friends, will they jack me?
Everybody gotta die..
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
(You need people like me..)
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
The plan, to take command of the whole family
To be the boss, only thought's: grip on chrome 9's
Niggas get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
A pistol grabbin' nigga, unleash the Sandman
Blast, tell me, homie, what you see now?
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier
When my Glocks rang out, the niggas came out, BOOM!
Who wanna see me in a challenge?
Sheddin' tattooed tears, another suicidal on the tier
All the feds they aware of us
Multi-millionaire, shit, it ain't fair
I'm a well known plastic case, call me [?]
Prolly get your cash elevate to a faster rate
They wanna blast while I last in this tragic place
And make the pain merciless and tragic
Lookin' for these better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Nobody watches 'em, clockin' the evil man do
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
And only we can change
Hey, better days
Better days, better days, better days
That in my future years I'd be stressin'?
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Savin' up for some Jordan's, ‘cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her, but she broke too
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
Better days
Hardly parted or separated, we stayed faded
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart
I settled down, had a family, workin' a night school
Better days, better days
Better days, better days, better days
Better days is comin', homeboy, keep your head up!
Lookin’ for these better days
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
And only we can change
And pray for better days
Better dayz, better days
Got me thinkin’ bout better days
Cowboys and Indians when your belly run
When the only thing we sprayed was water guns
When your next door neighbour was your best friend
Searchin for real to leave the past behind me
And neighbourhood watch go to cops
Sayin you settin up shop
Who be keepin us down, in these fucked up scoop
Whoever said it so good, must be a muthafuckin fool
It’s goin to leave a lot of muthafuckaz stunned
Let’s show some love in the right way
Now after so many years, ain’t shit changed
That’s why we hang, where we bang
So you do what you gotta do to stay alive
Beggin the Lord to bring better dayz
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin to kiss her
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin
Baby there you go, actin like a ho
Baby there you go, actin like a ho
HOE! Girl you need to check yourself
I got hoes that got more, hoes than me
So how I look, gettin hooked, like I ain't got G?
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
Woke up one morning out some bomb ass cock
Seen my little homey Style who I ain't seen in a while
Yeahh, and I'm feelin' alright
Hoppin' like a motherfucker tryin' to find a hoe
I'm headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Pushin' caviar, and a little bit of pussy
Did this cold, how we fade our foes
'Cause they got me on the run
So I’ma get smart and get defensive and shit
Bitches get ready for the throwdown, the shit's about to go down
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
They wonder how I live with five shots
Now do the gangsters run this motherfucker? (Hell Yeah)
West Side is motherfuckin' right here
Give it up for The House Of Blues
Go West Side Outlaw
West Side!
Outlaw, microphone check
You don't know, look like you a seed
From Makaveli The Don....
Oh you bitch niggas....
I don't know if you catch up, but yet and still
Thug life, Outlaw forever nigga
Class is in session: the worst question is the first question
Fat track got you sprung, now you're hung?
So I just go with what I know, I don't trust none
What's the reward for a struggler?
If the law lovin' us, then why they hate to see us comin' up?
Nobody don't care (Seems like my dreams
Drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care
“I couldn't help but notice you’re pain”
A symbol for unrewarded struggle
(It's gonna get ya’, gonna get ya')
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Not to be phoney and positive but why be negative?
Dum dum diddy answer me?
If not peace then, at least let's get a piece
We used to have troops but now there's no more, youth to shoot
Rotten black cotton in God's eyes
My mama told me they'd be day's like this but I'm pissed
Yo Mouse man
(They claim that I'm violent)
Be on point make sure you're back it's got
A double M is kept, ready to cock
My mama told me they'd be day's like this but I'm pissed
Straight pissed
(It's gonna get ya')
Rotten black cotton in God's eyes
(It's gonna get ya')
(It's gonna get ya')
Rotten black cotton in God's eyes
In God's eyes
(It's gonna get ya')
(It's gonna get ya')
(They claiming that I'm violent)
(It's gonna get ya')
(You can be Christian)
(Islamic) No doubt (Doesn't matter to me, I'm a thug)
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin' he might care
Got me bailin' to stash more green guys
My cell block, whatever, held rock but never
High sigh why die wishin', hopin' for possibilities
Submissive souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
Some day, some how
Some way we gon' fail
Either six ditches or twelve
Just stick us and leave us in jail
When the outcome don’t do me justice in the long run
And Black Jesus come and save our seeds 'cause we need you
You think you could stop a motherfucker like me?
The more I unite with mo' niggas and mo' niggas and mo' niggas
I owe him, thanks to my man Mike Cooley and the rest of our fathers
* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists
Posessing a spirit that was strong
It will be your strength, that keep us both standing
That makes us both stand
Black woman, you are pure, love to me
and I knew from that point on
I want smiles 2 replace the sorrow
but please fight that with your all
it will be your strength that keep us both standing
For my life and your life
As long as we're cooperating with God
Remember what my pops told me
My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Now, rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies
No doubt, gettin' higher than a motherfucka, bless me, please
C'mon, yeah
(blas-blas-blasphemy, blasphemy)
Plus the media be crucifyin' brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son; nigga, momma a virgin
We got evicted, had to leave the 'burbs
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up, deadly
God comin', she's just takin' her time (haha!)
I’m contemplatin' plots, wonderin' where the thought’ll go
Brothas gettin' shot, comin' back resurrected
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holding a bird in a cloud
Have you ever seen a crackhead? That's eternal fire
Memories of a past time, givin' up cash to the leaders
It's hard enough to live, now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man
Using the name of the lord in vain
These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
See me rise, located worldwide like the art of graffiti
Born on a dope fiend's titty, in every city
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Lookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
West Coast rider, comin' right behind ya
Should have never fucked with me
Please reconsider 'fore you die
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
Got nuttin' to lose, I gots nowhere to go
Then what is your motherfuckin' purpose? Narcing service
But I'm from Jers', we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks all my niggas flippin’ chips
Tryna creep through these halls and brawls without scarred by a revolve'
Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
We bomb first when we ride
G's and thug niggas on the rise
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
Let us pray, my nigga
'Cause we definitely have sinned
Kickin' doughs, puttin' holes in mothafuckas leavin' hoes disposed of
Nigga lay ya down when I creep, on a mission to send ya six feet
Positioned myself to pops states the path whatever dig
You pay a bitch, I’ll pay a crooked cop
Then hustle on the block, and stack my money that I future plot
These bitches and them vultures that surround my group
My head talkin' to my damn self-stretched vexed
Another mothafucka dead, layin' in red
As I bloodied up his mothafuckin' mug picture
You jeopardizin' lives when you fuckin' wit' soldiers (I told ya)
I keep spittin', still stupid niggas fail to listen
Except some who want more out of life than stress
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs
"Free 2Pac" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
Niggas be actin' like they savage, I'm out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish
And I can make you famous
I live in fear of a felony
If you got it, better flaunt it
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
It's like cuz, blood gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Floatin' in the black Benz (Biatch), tryin' to do a show a day
Now do the Lakers run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
Do the gangsta run this motherfucker?
Or do the ladies run this motherfucker?
(It's a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
West side in this motherfuckin' party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Deathrow at it's finest
One love, west coast, one love
And I don't need a posse, my Glocks like a pocket full of rockies
Fifty to the first that can drop me
Now make a make a way here I come with a clip
Mad circle mutilate motherfuckers
Khakis and them steel toe boots is how we roll
Catch 'em slippin' backstage start fadin' they ass
So go in the house y'all here comes that crazy nigga flippin' on the mailman and innocent bystanders
Wicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion
Kind of like Nike, I never have to ask questions
All it takes, is a place, and a place, and a time and a rhyme
Out the trunk with this funky attitude
Yes!
MC's take ya time, before ya start the rhyme
Kill a nigga, kill a nigga
Yea, come on break 'em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
So I start kickin', the funky ass [?] shit
Live from the motherland, here's my objective
Let this microphone pump
Stressed but busta free
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Woke up with 50 enemies plottin' my death
All 50 seein' visions of me shot in the chest
Bless me, Father, I'm a sinner, I'm livin' in hell
Gettin' world-wide exposure
With a bunch of niggas that don't give a fuck, ridin' as my soldiers
Enemies give me reason
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here
I'm still breathin'
With these fag ass niggas, see-through-glass ass niggas
Only-ride-my-dick-and-the-skin-of-my-mash ass niggas
Bustin' my automatic rounds
I walk around with a knife in my back
Breathin' in sewer stench, no one give a fuck about me
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still I'm breathin'!
Just lost two of my closest na'r, one of y'all can take this
Shit, Pac still doin' it, you hoes can't ruin it
Two million every time he drop, I know you fuckers losin' it
Style-bitin', thug-lyin' niggas, give it up! We hit 'em up!
(Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin'?)
Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin'?
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Bustin', my automatic rounds
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin'
All fifty seein' visions of me shot in the chest
A thug nigga screamin' "West Side", bustin' double Glocks
With a bunch of niggas that don't give a FUCK, ridin' as my soldiers
Bustin', my automatic rounds
Stressed, but busta free
Rather be your N.I.G.G.A. if you still let me
A world wide mob figga, local nightmare, just call 'em right there
Some have prophesized, homicide, some have tried
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Went out and had a church of kids
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
She's got a baby
Oh
Buried
Maybe in our dreams over sheds is reality
Niggas say one love
One Nation
Retaliation, perpetrating get you punished, how could you
Watch me
Hard to figure knew this nigga for eternity
I keep stepping with my weapon on queue
We fight to live and struggle (Fight to live and struggle)
Your fight (Your Life)
What you gonna do?
Now if my memory serves me justly
And now I got this pistol pointed at your mouth, ready to squeeze
Brothaz at arms
In the end it's
Overcome all the troubles
Let's get it on now
(What? Say what?)
Uh
All solider's be friends of me
Puffin on blunts and gettin' drunk to keep from goin' under
Gettin' lost in the madness, blunted gettin' tipsy
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggas that's caught
Bullet to the brain!
Goin' to hell with my finger on the trigger
Bullet to the brain!
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy
So suck [?]
Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Tell me how can I survive
Will I live or die?
Forgive me Lord
The streets are full of enemies watch over me
Even when I die they don't worry me
Something about this game that keep a shory holler for pain
??? so i took the hit for granted, and a revolver will be my only hope for escape, talking 'bout doing the same
But the feeling can wait, who can you blame on these inner-city streets?
Nah, I ain't afraid, just pary that I make top-grade
Bury me  a g, bury me  a g, thug life know the time it is, feel me
Finger on the trigger when a nigga ride
Pick my money off the floor, God bless the tre-four
I ain't got time for bitches
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Collect calls to my old bitches, send more pictures
Keep my finger on my Mac man
Niggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
So you wanna make a million?
That's how it goes, you motherfuckers try to play me and the homies
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
Lord knows I don't need another DUI
I lead a Thug Life, heartless hustler
"Is it cool to fuck?" That's what I'm askin'
I let a trick be a trick, you can have that bitch
(cause) I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
California knows how to party
In the city of good ol' Watts
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Uh, yeah, Oaktown

Gangsta shit
Ay yo, Pac
Let these motherfuckers know what kind of party they in right now
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
"Free 2Pac" is all that's on a nigga's mind
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker
If you got it, better flaunt it
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Throw your motherfuckin' hands in the air, you know what I mean?
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down, give me love!
California love
California knows how to party
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
What the fuck is wrong with you East Side?
California knows how to party

Shake, shake it, mama
The shit don't stop, it don't stop
Turn that dawg right thought before we get started
California love!
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
I been in the game for ten years making rap tunes
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
In the city of good ol' Watts (good ol' Watts)
In the city, the city of Compton (city of Compton)
Shake it shake it baby, shake, shake it shake it baby

Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
You screamin', "Go 2Pac!" and I ain't stoppin' till I'm well-paid
And you'll never realize
My shit be poppin' out the record store as if it was a drug house
D-R-E, you got me heated; my words like a penitentiary dick
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode
My enemies deceased
Oh!! Which way did he go?
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
You can't see me
I'm in the flesh, baby, but you can't see me
Thug Life, baby
I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers!
You can't see me
Right before your eyes, you won't even realize
Scared bitch motherfuckas, Yeah
Dave Duke sure look cute in that black suit Oooohhh
And brain cell's tingle I'm feeling stronger than a fuckin mad Dingo
And we don't need no more statistic's
Rollin' down the 405, beware of stangers
Hand on my 4-5; that's what the fame does
Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me
Before the penitentiary, let's get it on!
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
Some say the Government will watch me
Trust, I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me
Better duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - b-blaaastin
And everyday it just a struggle
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
Ready to bust
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
Can u c the pride in the pantha
as he glows in splendor and grace
of the progression of his race
as she nurtures her young all alone
One love, one life
Can you see.. the pride of the panther
In the concrete jungle, alone with her cub
As he glows in splendor and grace?
Can you see the pride in the panther
The seed must grow regardless
Of the fact that it's planted in stone
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Topling the obstacles placed
It outshines all the rays of the sun
Shines bright like the rays of the SUN!
Shine bright like the rays of the sun (c'mon)
Keep high like a new day begun, say
To shine bright like the rays of the sun (uh-huh)
SHINE BRIGHT LIKE THE RAYS OF THE SUN (whoo!)
Keep high like a new day begun (ha ha)
Keep high like a new day begun (ha ha)
Carry out like a new day begun
A new day begun, a new day begun
Power to the people! (Power to the people)
Love is people power (LOVE)
Like we love love.. one love
And this is an act of love
Who am I? A panther
What I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE
Raise your hands in the air if you feel like me
What I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE
What I got I got PRIDE, what I wanna be FREE
And outshines the rays of the sun
Shines out, like the sun
The R hold it down at the end for respect
Who am I? A panther
Raise your hands in the air if you feel like me
I know you got a man, but he ain't gon' mind if I take you out
Oh aight – what's wrong with your eye?
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
Ain't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion
Got you shakin' when I'm standin' near you
All he does is hit you hard
Tell me, can you get away?
Can you get away?
I'm not happy here (Do you love that man?)
But you was different, I got no need to be suspicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow
Hopin' I can take you through the pain and sorrow
And I can't get away (Did he punch you?)
Me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
I refuse to give up, ‘cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
‘Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
So much pressure in the air (Can't get away why?)
I ain't tryin' to put you in a position
You need, but now… he ain't even takin' care of you
Let me show you what this life is really about
Need to be goin' to Hawaii, seein' the world
‘Cause this nigga done got jealous. Don't cry, it's all good
Shake that man, get away
Can you see the pride in the Panther
Turn it up loud
You a little sucker for love, right?
I shoulda seen
I hear you callin me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
I'm never gonna dance again, hahahaha thats right
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
The way I danced with you
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta...")
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Let 'em know...nigga
Count money while I ram it, dog
Now follow as we ride
And I can make you famous
I live in fear of a felony
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
They wonder how I live with five shots
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Nothin' but a gangsta party
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party
u saw innocence at its best
2 wake up 2 u each morning
Ahahah yeah!, my homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Uh, yeah!, my homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Ain't a livin' soul breathin' shall pump no fear here
Smokin' lye watchin' time fly, waitin' for death
Keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me
Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Catchin' feelins
But that ain't me, dog, my mind's now clear
We might wobble, but we don't fall down
We started the thug trend, the game is ours
Won't question when we die together
Bring it
Motherfuckas, and we here to stay
Ain't no tellin' when it all can end, roll a rock
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
I can't trust the church or the mobs, I can only trust God
And to tell you the truth I gotta ride
Cause rollin' with the fake got my loved ones killed
Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
Didn't they sound like suckaz?
Going for none
My last foe flashed then I mashed his ass
Paranoid with my pistols close, smokin' trees
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Ay, turn the lights out
Y'know how we swing this shit, look
Until they noticed me
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin' is
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Got rocks in my socks Cops
Spot Watt niggas but hardly stop niggas
To be in a Ferrari or the old SL
I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
But you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece G
You fuckin' with a changed man
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
Who's that nigga in the G-ride
Number one in the nation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin' to the whole nation
One love to my thug niggas
Fuckin' with a changed man
Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man
A changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
You fuckin' with a changed man
E'rybody think they understand me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
We ain't the same, fuckin' with a changed man
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggas trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
But keep hoping and praying, laying the foundation
Imitation is lethal, stay true to the one's you love
You make emergency call, to a down fall
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin' through coastin'
#1 in the nation
I fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation
GIMME MINE, or I'm blastin' on every song
One love to my thug niggas
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Nigga you fuckin with a changed man
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
"Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
We gotta start makin' changes
And that's how it's supposed to be
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we live
You gotta learn to hold your own
That's the sound of my tool
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
Some things'll never change
Ay what time is it nigga?
Just another sunny day in California
Give a holla to them hoochies last night, that tried to rape us
Last night was like a fantasy, Alizé and Hennessy
Gotta go, gotta go
My fantasies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
I ain't got that much time
Ay Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin', where my shoes go, nigga?
What the fuck y'all doin', nigga?
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go!!! oooo!!
I'mma thug where I wanna thug
I'mma ride where I wanna ride
