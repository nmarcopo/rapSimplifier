Can you feel the pride of the pantha?
As it shines in splendor and grace
Knocked down OBSTACLES placed on the road
of his career progression
Can you feel Pantha's pride?
while she cares for her young man completely alone
The seed must grow independently
from the fact that it's planted in stone
You CAN'T c pride in panthas
as they unify as one
Flower blooms with shine
and outshines the ray of the sun
