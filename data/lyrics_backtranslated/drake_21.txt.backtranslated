I am grateful to be able to call America my second home. Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling's death, it left me feeling down, emotional and really scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something.
It is impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and the police is still as tense as it was decades ago. No one starts life as a hashtag. However, the trend to reduce to one continues.
This is real and I am concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends and any human being who may be a victim of this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I think things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step.
My thoughts and prayers go out to the Sterling family and any families who have lost someone in this cycle of violence.
Be safe out there More life.
