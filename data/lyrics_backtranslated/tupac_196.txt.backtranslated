God
When I was alone and had nothing
I asked a friend to help me endure the pain
No one came except God
When I needed a breath to get up, from my dream
No one could help me ... except God
When all I saw was sadness, and I needed answers
No one heard me except God.
So when they ask me ... who do I give my unconditional love to?
I'm not looking for another name except God
