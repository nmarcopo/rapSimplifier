* Fragment letters *
... the offer you gave me was absurd
Daddy, this bird won't fly, you sold me an ostrich
I'm just another nigga trying to keep your money
I'm going to wipe that smile off your face, you think it's funny, huh?
I'm not playing my nigga go and laugh
But the bullets don't tickle
If you think you're playing with Elmo, hell no
