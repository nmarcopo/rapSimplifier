Go blame me, we won't blame you
We are not going to blame the night that sounds to you
We are not going to blame that, we are not going to target you
He said you would never fool yourself, what a shame. Sometimes you think I'm asleep, shit, you think I'm sweet
I put the phone on silent, everything vibrated the sheets. When they took me to jail, I thought you were waiting for me
Mess with the same old lame people who hated me all. All that shit that you told all those lies that you told
All that shit you made, those false dreams you sold. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand why I'm so cold
I got an ice box on my chest, girl, my heart froze
