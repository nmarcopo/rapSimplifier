Yeah you know who the fuck is
BM, say no more, falling back with Meek Mill, man (yeah)
Listen to that crack music man
For the real man, niggas shit (all of you niggas shit for real man)
If you niggas ain't pushing, repeat yet, man
Press repeat and shuffle
This shit here
Man this shit doesn't come out all season
Who else do you know has all the flamers, nobody?
Real fucking man, listen to Chi records
It's our nigga city
