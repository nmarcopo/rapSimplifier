About Macklemore winning the best rap album
It is well deserved; did what he did, man. He got out and hurried up and smiled. Everything happens for a reason; the universe returns, this is how it works.
At the Grammys they snub him completely
I definitely feel like they should always have more culture there, no doubt, because we definitely stand out like any other genre. We are part of the world. We are part of the movement. So I think any award, including the Grammys, should always drive more hip-hop because it's music as a whole, it's not just about dividing different regions. Everything moves as far as sound and vibrations, and this is how it goes. And we are part of it.
