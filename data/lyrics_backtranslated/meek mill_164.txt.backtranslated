Yeah this is treacherous nights, Killadelphia dude shit
Squeeze your thirties when you go to sleep
All we know is armed violence (armed violence)
Go to jail, come back and now your son is wild (He is wild)
I got a price on your head, you don't give a shit (don't give a shit)
Sitting on the couch with his grandmothers, he smells like gunpowder (shit)
Yee, Yee, all we know is gun violence (that's all we know)
He just smoked a nigga ample day, don't give a shit (Hrr)
Now the murder has gone to his head, he's rushing for it (hurries)
