2 your name is only poetry
I hardly know you and now
I can't explain this feeling that I feel
April 4
I want 2 c u from the moment
you leave my side until the moment you come back
My cold indifferent heart finally only has eyes
April 4
So now I risk it all
Only 4 the feeling of joy that you bring me
I accept the ridiculous
in exchange for the words you share with me
All this and much more I will
April 4
