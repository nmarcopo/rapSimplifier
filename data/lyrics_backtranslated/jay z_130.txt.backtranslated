Check
I'm here
The man
I'm swinging, singing and bringing
The light to the mic
Again
Together forever
Effort, to always prevail
Good
Whatever the weather
I'm better
You seem to pale
Compared
Jay-Z's embarrassing
Your time later
Riggity-rhyme master
Jay-Z's last rhyme ligature
So you can say that I am
So pro fade line
Peace
