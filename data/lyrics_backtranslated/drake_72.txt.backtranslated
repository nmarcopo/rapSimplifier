That shit was crazy
I thought: 'You won. Why are you posting your text message? Just relax. Take your W, and if you feel like you don't deserve it, get better, make better music. It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilty? Do you think those guys would pay homage to you if they won?
This is how the world works: He made a music brand that attracted more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. If people want to say that he is racial, or if it is just the fact that he took advantage of something that we cannot take advantage of. This is how the cards fall. Own your shit
To name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny. No, in that case, you stole from everyone. We all need text messages!
