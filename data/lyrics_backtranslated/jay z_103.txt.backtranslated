Part 1
My life after childhood has two main stories: the scammer story and the rapper story, and the two overlap as much as they diverge. I have been on the street for more than half of my life since I was thirteen. People sometimes say that I am now so far from that life, now that I have businesses, Grammys and magazine covers, that I have no right to rap about it. But how distant will the story of your own life be? The feelings I had during that part of my life were imprinted on me as a brand. It was life in times of war. In "Public Service Announcement"
Even when a rapper is just rapping about how silly he is, something a little deeper is happening. It's like a sonnet, believe it or not. Sonnets have an established structure, but also a limited theme. They are mostly about love. Talking about such a familiar topic and writing about it in an established structure forced sonnet writers to find every corner of the topic and challenged them to invent a new language to say old things. It's the same with braggadacio in rap. When we take the most familiar theme in rap history, why am I stupid, and frame it within the sixteen-bar structure of a rap verse, synchronized to the specific beat and feel of the track, more than anything it's a proof of creativity and ingenuity. It is like a metaphor in itself; If you can tell how silly you are in a completely original, intelligent, and powerful way, the rhyme itself becomes proof of the truth of boasting. And there are always deeper layers of meaning buried in the simplest verses of the Negative Space section
Hip-hop has always been controversial and for good reason. When you watch a kids show and they have a muppet rap about the alphabet, it's cool, but it's not really hip-hop. Music is meant to be provocative, which does not mean it is necessarily unpleasant, but it is (mostly) confrontational, and more than that, it is dense with multiple meanings. Great rap should have all kinds of unresolved layers that you don't necessarily discover the first time you listen to it. Instead, plant dissonance in your head. You can enjoy a song that plays in the club or has clever phrases the first time you listen to it. But the great rap preserves the mystery. Leave some shit in your head that won't make sense until the fifth or sixth time. Challenges you
That's the other reason hip-hop is controversial: People don't bother trying to get it. The problem is not in rap or rapper or culture. The problem is that many people don't even know how to listen to music.
Since rap is poetry, and a good MC is a good poet, you can't half listen to a song and think you already have it. This is what I mean: the mission of a poet is to make words work more than normal, so that they work on more than one level. For example, a poet makes words work soundly, like sounds, like music. Traditionally, hip-hop tracks have been heavy on the rhythms, light on the melody, but some MCs, for example, Bone Thugs â€˜N Harmony, find ways to incorporate melodies into rap. Other MCs - think Run from Run-DMC - turn words into percussion: cool boss rocks, I don't drink vodka, but I keep a bag of cheeba inside my locka. The words themselves don't mean much, but he breaks those clipped syllables like drum, bap bap bapbap. It is as exciting as watching a middleweight throw a perfect combination. If you listened to that joint and came out thinking it was just a rhyme about keeping the grass in a gym locker, you'd be reading it wrong: the goal of those bars is to get a rhythmic idea, not be impressed with the literal meaning of the words
But great MCing isn't just about filling the song meter with rhythm and melody. The other ways that poets make words work is by giving them layers of meaning, so you can use them to get to complicated truths in a way that direct narration cannot. The word he uses can be read in a dozen different ways: they can be fun and serious. They can be symbolic and literal. They can be clearly obvious and subliminally effective at the same time. The art of rap is misleading. It seems so direct, personal and real that people read it completely literally, like raw testimony or autobiography. And sometimes the words we use, nigga, bitch, motherfucker, and the violence of the images overwhelms some listeners, it's all white noise for them until they hear a bitch or a nigga and then they run screaming "Look ! " and they feel vindicated in their limited conception of what music is about. But that would be like listening to Maya Angelou and ignoring everything until you hear her talk about drinking or sleeping with someone's husband and then fire her as an alcoholic adulteress.
But I can't say that I really cared about people who hear a curse and start foaming at the mouth. Fox News mannequins. They wouldn't know art if it fell on them.
