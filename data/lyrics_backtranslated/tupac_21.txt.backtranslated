I remember when you were lost
and your soul was in the wind
It was at this uncomfortable moment
that you and I become friends
But then your soul was found
and you discovered celibacy
But with this you forgot about me
and our bond was a memory
And now I see you feel it
that bond that we made before
I pray to God to stay
and never again
