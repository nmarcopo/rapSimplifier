I'm so fucking hungry, my head hurts. I had to fix myself and make my head work, but at the same time I had to maintain my rap career first. Everyone knows that The Hood can be your worst distraction and when a black man disrespects The gun is your first reaction. This is how we live in the fight, all we have is pride. So when a nigger takes it from you, you have to bear murder murder. So, by all necessary means, I strive to get my mom out of the chapel since my dad died. If you don't grind and then you don't shine shit I gotta try, done man Brave man Nigga It's me. I'm from the chapel where the tears never end and the pain never stops, the game on the clock. Yes, it seems sunny, but the rain is going to fall and the bodies are going to fall, that's why I'm going hard. Wandering these bad streets, I'm on guard Cus Niggas, stealing lives faster and then stealing cars. I am still alive praying that I will not fall, this sin made me win even though I am completely wrong. Then I stop looking around. We are all gone. The last of the last strong holds. Some say I have not earned it, you break it, I burn it, I am going to rebuild it because I am thorough and determined. Call me meek mill because I am the most real. in the world. From north to south, I am murder while you were relaxed. I was in my crib writing raps thinking of millions, cars, jewelry, and buildings. Blacks don't respect him until they see you progress, but trust me. mma kill em. This is a 645 without the topless coupe, great fun on the engine. This is big business 44s 40s and 9s that are big cookies. 40 guys target your squad now that's revenge. They prefer to see you shot before they see you lift a chain around your neck all cool pulling that drop. I got around set 9 except where the niggas get up, so I had no choice but to grind and get this trap. Ever since I was a child, my mothers were my dad, the streets were my old head and I was raised as a rider
