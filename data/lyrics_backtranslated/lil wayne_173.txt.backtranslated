Now listen man. This here is dedicated to all the young bastards around the world, especially in my city, the man from New Orleans. I respect how they hold their heads and stand firm after the disaster, you know what I mean. You keep your head up high after the disaster. Not only my city, there are all cities and there are all young people, not all young people, but almost all young people, or there is a young man everywhere who has gone through or has gone through his own disaster, or who is going through his own personal disaster. But not to end, so as not to undermine my city, you know what I mean, we went through a difficult one, and I want, I want the young mother to fuck that she knows that I see them all black. I see them all black. Making money in different cities nigga, getting money in different ways, nigga respect my city nigga respect a New Orleanian when you see him in your mother fuck. Because if they are not black, I will make them respect me
