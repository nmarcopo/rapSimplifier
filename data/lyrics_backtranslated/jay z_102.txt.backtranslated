EPILOGUE
Since then, Oprah and I have become friends, having watched each other cautiously from a distance. But it was a fascinating moment for me. Rap, as I said at the beginning of the book, is basically an art form that gave voice to a specific experience, but, like all art, it is ultimately about the most common human experiences: joy, pain, fear, desire, uncertainty. , hope, anger, love - crew love, family love, even romantic love (put on "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" sometime and tell me that rap can't be romantic - or if you want to keep it on the street, put on Mary J. Blige and Method Man's "I'll be there for you / You are all I need to survive"). Of course, in the end, it may not be the art form for you. Oprah, for example, still can't get over the n-word problem (or the black problem, with all apologies to Mrs. Winfrey). I can respect your position. For her, it is about recognizing the deep and painful history of the word. For me, it is just a word, a word whose power is owned by the user and his intention. People empower words, so banning a word is useless, really. "Nigga" becomes "mono porch" becomes "coon" and so on if that is what is in a person's heart. The key is to change the person. And we change people through conversation, not through censorship. This is why I want people to understand what the words we use, and the stories we tell, are really about.
And that's why I wrote this book. I love to write rhymes. There's probably nothing that gives me so much pleasure. There were times in my life when I tried to put it aside: when I was a kid, so I could focus on rushing on the streets and when I was an adult, so I could focus on rushing the boardroom, but the words kept coming. They are still coming and will probably never stop. That's my story.But the history of culture in general is the story of a million MCs from all over the world who look out their windows or stand on street corners or ride their cars through their cities or suburbs or towns. small and within them come the words, too, the words they need to make sense of the world they see around them. The words are witty and forceful, abstract and linear, sober and fucked up. And when we decode that torrent of words, by which I really mean listening to them with our minds and hearts open, we can better understand their world. And ours too. It is the same world.
