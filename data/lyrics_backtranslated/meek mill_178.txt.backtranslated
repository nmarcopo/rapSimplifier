North Philly where am I
Dickie black hoodie with my hat P
Maserati with automatic start where the key
Where is the key i don't know
It's not money, I'm not going
You have money, I have money, the difference is mine
How real is this
Cooling at the cut higher than a Louis label
When the biddies see me I remind them of a Gucci bag
Because they love me and they need me
I'm like Seymour, feed me
I'm making money believe me
Hoes want to pop the boy because I'm on TV
