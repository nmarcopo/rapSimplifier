Part 3: POLICY AS A HABITUAL
The poor generally have a twisted relationship with the government. We are aware of the government from the moment we are born. We live in government-funded housing and work in government jobs. We have family and friends who spend time in the best public housing, prison. We grow up meeting people who pay for everything with small plastic cards: Medicare check-up cards, EBT food cards. We know what AFDC and WIC mean and we are waiting hours waiting for government cheese bricks. The first and the fifteenth of each month are times of maximum economic activity. We get to know all kinds of government agencies not because of the kind of civic education, but because they really visit our homes and sit on our couches asking questions. Since we are little children we go to ruined public schools that tell us everything we need to know about what the government thinks of us.
Then there are the cops.
In places like Marcy, there are people who know the ins and outs of government bureaucracies, police procedures, and sentencing guidelines, who spend half their lives in dirty waiting rooms in plastic chairs waiting for someone to call them by name. But despite all this involvement, the government could very well be the weather because many of us don't think we have anything to do with it; We do not believe that we have any control over what controls us. Many of our heroes, almost by default, were people who tried to dismantle or overthrow the government, Malcolm X or Black Panthers, or people who tried to make it completely irrelevant, like Marcus Garvey, who wanted blacks to sail. Back to Africa. The government was everywhere, and we hate it.
Housing projects are a great metaphor for the government's relationship with poor people: these huge islands built primarily in the middle of nowhere, designed to store lives. However, people are still people, so we turn projects into real communities, poor or not. We played fire hydrants and had cookouts and parties, music bouncing off the concrete walls. But even when we were able to shake off the weight of those towering buildings and simply try to live, the truth of our lives and struggle remained invisible to the country as a whole. The rest of the country was released from any obligation to claim us. Which was fine, because we weren't really claiming them either.
