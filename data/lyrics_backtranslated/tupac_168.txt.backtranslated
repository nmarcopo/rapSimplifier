You say you will love me forever, but what about today?
As the sunsets dawn and the years go by, you will love me the same way
If so, let us rejoice and bathe in constant pleasure
If you don't forgive my heart today and I'll recover before forever
What if my doubts and? It bothers you, forgive my fragile heart
I just wanted to know if you would love me forever
Before today I would BEGIN!
