you saw innocence at its best
I loved you more than I loved me
I remember my last thought at night was about you
and my first thought in the morning was about you
It's been a long time since I actually
i sat and adored you but every once in a while
Your beautiful smile guides me through a day
I listen to you with another and you are waiting
I wish you good luck, he is lucky 2 power
2 wake up 2 u every morning
You are in heaven?
