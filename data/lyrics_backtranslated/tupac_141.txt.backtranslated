I remember when you were LOST
and your soul was in the wind
It was at this uncomfortable moment
that you and I became friends
But then your soul was found
and you discovered celibacy
But with this you forgot about me
and our bond was a memory
And now I can feel it
the link we made before
I pray 2 God, stop
and never again
