This is special, man. As my boy Mozzy says, you know, God is on top all the time. We really talk, you know. Hip-hop, man. I said hip-hop.
This is a special award for rap music. This is what brought me to the stage. This led me to travel around the world, support my family and all that. Most importantly, it showed me a true definition of what it was to be an artist.
From the jump I thought it was all about the compliments, the cars and the clothes. But it's really about expressing yourself and putting that painting on the canvas so that the world evolves for the next listener, the next generation after that, you know what I'm saying? Hip-hop has done it for me.
I have a lot of guys in this building right now who still idolize me to this day: Jay-Z, Nas, Puff, you know. These boys showed me the game through their lyrics, up close and far.
So with that said, this hip-hop trophy, a real conversation. That is love, darling. Jay for president!
