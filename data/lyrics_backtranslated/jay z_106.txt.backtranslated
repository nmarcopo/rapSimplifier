From part 4
When I started working on this book, I told my publisher that I wanted him to do three important things. The first was to demonstrate that hip-hop lyrics, not just my lyrics, but those of every great MC, are poetry if you look closely enough. The second was that I wanted the book to tell a little bit of the story of my generation, to show the context of the choices we made at a violent and chaotic crossroads in recent history. And the third part was that he wanted the book to show how hip-hop created a way to take a very specific and powerful experience and turn it into a story that everyone in the world could feel and relate to.
All those threads came together at a crucial moment for me, the moment when I completely crossed from one life to another.
