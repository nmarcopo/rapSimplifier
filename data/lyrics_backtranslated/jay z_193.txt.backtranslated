The other night, when I was researching what was going to be discussed today, I came across a written passage, I think it really exemplifies what the little brother next to me was talking about and learned that everything must end.
It is an inevitable part of the cycle of existence, all things must end
Take the analogy of a tree growing in Brooklyn between steel and concrete with all its glorious branches and leaves, one day it will also pass on its legacy through the seeds it dropped to the ground and when the wind carries these seeds everywhere They could move, a new life will begin for each of them, since they are erected as a monument to the previous one.
That came before
That came before
That came before
That came before ...
