J.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in "Jodeci Freestyle". I share the responsibility and offer my sincere apologies for the pain this has caused. People with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be underestimated or discarded. This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I am grateful for the opportunity to try to correct this error. J. Cole and I believe that it is the correct, responsible and respectful decision to remove the lyrics from the song.
