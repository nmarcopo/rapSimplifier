Part 2: I WILL NOT LOSE
What is the basic motivation for a scammer? I went out for the same reason as many other children: I wanted money and excitement and I liked the idea of freeing myself from the rules and low ceilings of the heterosexual world. The truth is, most kids in the corner aren't making a lot of money, especially if you divide your income into hourly wages. * But they are being rewarded in ways that go beyond dollars and cents. The child on the streets has an opportunity to dream. The dream is that he will be the only one to make this hustle big. He sees the guy who gets rich and drives the nice car and thinks, yes, that will be me. Ignore the other stories that circulate, about guys being shot or beaten to death with bricks and chains. But they are working in that corner for more than any small cut they get from the crack they sell: they are working because they owe a miracle. The kid at McDonald's gets a check and that's it. There is no dream in fast food. Manager? That is a promotion, not a dream. It took me a long time to realize the bravery it took to work at McDonald's, to walk the streets passing rows of scam artists wearing that orange uniform. But at the time, it seemed like an act of surrender to a world that hated us. I never considered it a possibility.
When you have a nation of scammers working for a small number of slot machines, you learn something you will never learn at McDonald's. You learn to compete hard, even when you lose, because you can't settle for second best as a scammer. That is not worth it. The only reason to do it is for the first place, for the number one position ... Kind of like the music business. * The hourly wage [of the gang leader] was $ 66 ... foot soldiers earned just $ 3.30 an hour. In other words, a crack gang works more or less like the standard capitalist firm: you must be near the top of the pyramid to earn a big salary ... so if the crack business is the most dangerous job in America And if the wage is only $ 3.30 an hour, why would someone take the job?
