I want to thank me for never quitting
I want to thank me for always believing
I want to thank me for always being a donor
I want to thank me, oh yes I do
Oh i want to thank me for believing in me
And I want to thank me for never quitting
I want to thank me for doing more good than harm
I want to thank, I want to thank me
Oh I want to thank me for not having days off
I want to thank me for never quitting
I want to thank me, I just want to thank me
And thanks a little more, oh yes
