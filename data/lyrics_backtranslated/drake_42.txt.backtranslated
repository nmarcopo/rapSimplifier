I know that everyone enjoys the circus, but I want to clarify this image in question. This was not from a clothing brand shoot for my music career. This image is from 2007, a time in my life when I was an actor and working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, be stereotyped, and get elected. The photos depicted how African Americans were wrongly portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best friend at the time, Mazin Elsadig, who is also an actor from Sudan, tried to use our voices to raise awareness of the issues we deal with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and increase our frustrations at not always having a fair chance in the industry, and to point out that the fight for black actors had not changed much.
