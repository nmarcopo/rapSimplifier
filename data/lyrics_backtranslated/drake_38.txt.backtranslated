Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We would have been fine
All of these should have
In your ear once
Prolly was wasting my time
Because she heard it all
Because she heard it all
Girl, it could have changed your life
But she heard it all
Well i'll say it anyway shawty
I'm from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You don't have to be in love to fuck
Girl I'm just trying to say
I'm from the city, oh
Where money makes the difference
But it never made us different, oh
