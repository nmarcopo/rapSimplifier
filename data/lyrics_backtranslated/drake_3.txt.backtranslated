The first time, the first time I met Robyn Fenty was in 2005. I was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was "Pon de Replay", and the director ... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the girl playing background music in the restaurant while people dined. It's hard to believe that eleven years later, the three of us would join the image of their song called "Work".
Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not as the boy who sings while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the only one, Rihanna.
Captivating from day one, the iconic being Rihanna was already in a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, that is often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has continued to rise to an untouchable level ever since.
When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with each release. When it comes to performances, they huddle up en masse just to be in his presence ... obviously ... And when it comes to fashion and style, it makes it look so easy until you try to do it yourself, which is when you put on a little uncomfortable.
The most impressive thing is not the endless list of statistics, awards and achievements. The most impressive thing is the person. Some artists need to portray a character to achieve success, some need to minimize their own natural instincts to mix. She succeeds in doing something that no one in this industry does, which is to be herself.
This woman has overcome all competition while still being the same Barbadian girl, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a harvest unless it is to perform at the OVO Fest. We love music that can change styles from one album to another. We love the videos that change your artistic vision from year to year. But above all, we love the woman who has not changed since the first day.
She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my ... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I have admired her even though she is younger than me. She is a living and breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and Gentlemen, Recipients of the 2016 Michael Jackson Vanguard Award: Rihanna.
