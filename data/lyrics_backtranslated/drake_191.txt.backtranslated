How was your pop night?
He was, uh ... he was fine. Shit is crazy. All the energy out here is changing, you know, it's getting dark, fast. It's like men are on the road, it feels like someone is a target, you know, you just don't know where it will come from, you can't even measure it, man. It's like I'm out of that, trying to balance that to balance my own sanity, drink more, smoke more, you know you stay up so late it's early, like shit. However, I am not losing it, I am just letting off steam, I am not worried, it is too late for these boys to trust me, I am only more worried about myself, you know, I just have to go home.
