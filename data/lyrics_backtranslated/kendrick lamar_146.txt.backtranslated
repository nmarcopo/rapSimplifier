My first day, you fucking fans in this building, once. As I look around, this is the shit. I haven't been that intimate in a long time. We could be here all damn night, I have something. I haven't seen them in a minute, really shit. You know I'm serious when I say, I've been all over the world and that shit. A whole sea of people. But nothing like coming here in front of this small group. The people who have been with me from day one. Kendrick Lamar EP. Kendrick Lamar OD. Section-mothefucking-.80. Real shit. This is cool here, damn it, this is really cool right now. This is real shit, listen. For pimp a butterfly. People said a lot about this album. That had said album of the year, that album of this generation and all that shit. That's great, but also real shit to make this album therapy. Not just for you, but for me. You know what I'm saying? Because at six months as a good boy, the fall of the city of m.A.A.d., the life of what he knew, when he knew what he was, thinking he knew, changed completely in six months. And uh, you are going through the movement of the world telling yourself that you are great. And you try to make yourself believe that shit, but it's difficult because you're institutionalized where you come from. I still try to move and stay the way I like. I am a discreet black. And I am not afraid of the world. Me personally, I can't run with a hundred niggas like I usually do. I don't need, I don't want. And that's me from day one. So trying to understand the idea of being told who to run with can't help it. Because as I said on the EP Kendrick Lamar, "I need to be me, damn it." I think this shit can live forever, but looking at all of them alone. I have some of the most loyal ones. dedicated shit fans in the world (?). (?) I could talk all day (?). For pimp a butterfly. They allowed this crappy album to skyrocket to the top without any crappy commercial success. You all allowed me to be top notch without a single constant radius and shit. So that shows you that music is not something you can sell all the time. This shit belongs to you and only you, you know what I say? Shit that all of you can feel if you are insecure, if you are vulnerable, if you are angry, happy, angry or sad. You play this damn tape, you play your favorite music, and you love and live that shit. And you allow artists like me to come back to this group of people and do the shit I want to perform, do you understand what I'm saying? This may be the first and last time I do To Pimp a Butterfly in this race. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York was one of those cities I go back to do this shit. So with that said, let's shake this shit until the coffin falls or until everything falls. Let's go
