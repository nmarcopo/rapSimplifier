...cold
Get on this thing and send me to the moon
You can hate me when you know exactly what to do
Every time you see me, I'm with them thugs
We will not face them, but we also have them
Yes, water on me like a pool (Yes, yes, yes)
Bah, in the back (Bah)
Putting tens and that bit Guwop (Bah)
.223 that bitch gon 'bop (Bah)
