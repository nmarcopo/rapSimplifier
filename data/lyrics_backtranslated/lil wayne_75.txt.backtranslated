The Carter is the place
And I'm running this like I'm walking in the race like they're walking in place
Then I walk in that place like you give me my cake
And yes, I'm Martian, so give me my space
Timmet me, timmet me, I never date Ups, I mean, you never told me just uhhh after that, remember her
I send you back to the womb you came out of
I milk this thing, now boy raise your cows
Shorty give me brain like I'm smart like Brittany Houser
And I stay connected like an internet browser
