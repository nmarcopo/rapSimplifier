I don't have everything
In fact, I have nothing,
except a dream of a better day
And you, to help me find my way
Being a man, I'm sure to make mistakes
But to support you, I'd do whatever it takes
and if that meant my love was really true
I would gladly die and take care of you
I wish you knew how much I cared
You would see that my love is true. For the life we would share
Even if you changed your mind and said that our love was through
I would like to die, cry continuously and still love you
