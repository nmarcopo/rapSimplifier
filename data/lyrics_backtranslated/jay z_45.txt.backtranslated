A word from hov
Last night I performed at the University of Arizona, I had a great time! Despite all the excitement and jokes (as well as technical difficulties) I missed an opportunity to say something important.
Third Eye Blind and Kelly Clarkson were also on the show. I thought that was the strangest pairing, but I soon realized that is what I have always professed. NO BLACK or WHITE music just GOOD or BAD music ... It's stupid that you like things that aren't like you, and that applies outside of music ... If you're African American, you can have a Jewish friend. Wait, does Lyor have any Israeli mixed with her Jewish earl? (Sure they are paranoid, but so are black people after they have smoked marijuana, jaaaaa, plus the JEW and BLUEprint are the SAME.)
I think concerts like this should happen more often. (Outside the one or 2 festivals a year or "Zootopia") I'm going to put that in the universe ... next, Taylor Swift and Uncle Murda!
Sorry, not "Tweet" (do I?) So this will have to do ...
Love
