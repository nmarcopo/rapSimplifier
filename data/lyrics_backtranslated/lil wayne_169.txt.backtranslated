Shout the blue flag
Yells the red flag
Scream the black flag
Fuck the white flag
I'm not talking about any gang hit. I just wanted to say that surrender flag because I don't know if blacks really repeat white flags and that shit. So I mean the surrender flag so I don't get in trouble. No nigga is shooting at me I don't know what the hell happened. Nigga, a group of white flag niggas come in, "Nigga we are the white flag niggas." How sorry my nigga damn
Shout Drama, thanks again for letting me do this shit. Dedication 3, I can't wait until Dedication 4. And uh, this one here, man, this was for my fans, this was for young money, this was for you of course. But this was for young money so that you understand what I'm trying to do and get a little of what I've cooked here and see what blacks do. Also, I want to make it clear that every artist you hear on Young Money is likely doing their thing somewhere else, so what I'd love you to do is get, not just listen to them here, really come in and see what they're doing on everywhere, because if they're good here, chances are they're great there. I mean, pay attention to them, they are making movements. They are Makin's movements. And if you want to be with us, it's easy. It is easy. Give a nigger some head or something. Haha. Not homo, not for the niggas, though I'm not looking for more rappers. I don't even want to try, I'm straight. I am looking for beautiful, straight women. I'm not lying
