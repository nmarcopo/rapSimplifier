Can you see the pride of the panther?
As it grows in splendor and grace
Knocking down obstacles placed on the road,
of your career progression.
Can you see the pride of the panther?
while she cares for her young man completely alone
The seed must grow independently
from the fact that it's planted in stone.
Can you see the pride of the panther?
since they are unified as one.
The flower blooms with shine,
and outshines the rays of the sun.
