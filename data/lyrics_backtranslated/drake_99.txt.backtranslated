Hey, Drake, you never answer your damn phone, huh? Pick up the phone, man. I know they have you running, brother. Anyway, everything's fine with Socrates hooking you up, asshole. Hello, my best wishes for this tape. I hope you take over the world. You know we will. Be sure to take me there. You call me when you need that hook, you call me when you need that beat, you call me when you need that [hot 16], bro, and let's put all this math together, dawg. Once again, it's a whole gang for Room for Improvement, so we're about to take over this year, right? Right
Hi Drake, what's up? This is Keeyaga, your boy here. Umm, I don't know why you're not picking up the phone, you're probably out, you know, talking to Lindsay Lohan, or eventually you will be talking to her. But, look, it's your Keeyaga boy. I'm just calling to tell you what, I haven't spoken to you forever, indefinitely. You know, we have to go, you know, to downtown Toronto, kick him and do what we have to do, but, I have to, you know, hang up the phone because I have, you know, Beyonc√©, you know, even Mendes all in the another line. So do what you have to do and yell at your boy. All the best. Peace
