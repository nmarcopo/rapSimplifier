24/7, 365, Kendrick Lamar is always on time
Oh, did you think you understood everything?
Take it from the horse's mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you plan B was to win your hearts before we win a Grammy
These days the shit hasn't changed, different toilet, the same shit
And I drank a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you, it's been
If it had been for my past time, I wouldn't be rapping
But now I'm here, GQ, man of the year
