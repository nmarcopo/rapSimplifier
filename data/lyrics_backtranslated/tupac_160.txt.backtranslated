Because we all jump
of different trees
does not mean
we are not created equally
It is the true beauty in the tree
or in the vast forest where you breathe
the tree must fight 2 races
among the evils of weeds
I find greatness in the tree
that grows through thick and thin
blooms in the dark
and gives birth to 2 promising pods.
I was the tree that grew from weeds.
and it wasn't meant to be 2
embarrassed I'm not in fact I'm proud
from my blossoming family tree
