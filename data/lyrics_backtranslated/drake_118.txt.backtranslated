Go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
Go, go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
Go, go, go, go, go, go head
Go, go, go, go, go, go head
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You feel like it, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Uh, you're getting ready so I know we're going to be here awhile
Nail plates and files in the bathroom
Spend hours in salons on your hairstyles
At the mall accruing airline miles
Go to the gym, step on the scale, look at the number
You say you drop 10 pounds getting ready for summer
And you don't do it for the man, the men never realize
You only do it by yourself, you're the fucking coldest
Smart too, ooh you're my love
I've always liked my women's book and my street smart
As long as they have a small class for about half a day
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals everything and heels hurt when walking
But they go with the clutch you wear your lip gloss on
And look, I really think no one does it better
I love the way you put it together, huh
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You feel like it, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hairstyle done, all done ('Sup, girl)
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Well, aren't you a breath of fresh air?
Of all these shallow bitches digging for gold here
They get a ballet player, imagine they don't have to choose a career
I guess they plan to suck cocks until millions appear
Like "Voil√†!" You do it right, he could buy you a car
Now she plays these shoots like B.o.B plays the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having a few drinks at the bar.
I say I'm buying, you reject, that's a little strange
Independent with the behavior of an R&B singer
Bare ring, M3 Bimmer
Champagne Range, Jaguar triple white
Closet full of new clothes and bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You are not needy, greedy or easy like these other breezes
Who fucks for Riesling bottles and bowls of baked ziti?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You feel like it, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Atlanta girls let me see your hands (yeah)
Shake 'em up at those bitches who hate you with their friends (come on)
Girl you got it let them know everything is great
Combed nails, all great
And my girls from New York, let me see your hands
Shake 'em up at those bitches who hate you with their friends (come on)
Girl you got it let them know everything is great

Shake 'em up at those bitches who hate you with their friends (Yeah)
Girl you got it let them know everything great
Nails done, hair done - nails done, hair done
Say go to Cinderella, go to Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you're a killer
And there is no one more real, and there is no one more real, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Showtime)
Go, go, go, go, go (as we go)
Uh, 5 and a half years old in boys, the ass is off the hook
Cinderella about to lose the glass from her foot
And when I find it, it's when I find you
And we can do the things we never had the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm depressed for whatever it is, you're only leading the way
Let's have dinner, you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this Tammy girl in a purple Bentley
How did he get it, I'll never ask
I just knew it was fine as a ticket on the board
Yes, but yell at the owners
The girls who got diplomas and enough money to lend us
A little something extra if we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You feel like it, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? (Luxurious)
