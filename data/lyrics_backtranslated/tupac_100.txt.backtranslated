The Story On September 7, 1996, Tupac Shakur attended the boxing match between Bruce Seldon and Mike Tyson with Suge Knight. After the game, they attacked a cripple and went to Club 662 in the 1996 black BMW 750iL sedan with other cars behind as well. At 11:15, a late-model white four-door Cadillac pulled up to the right side of Tupac's car, swooping down the window, and started firing. Tupac was sent to the hospital and died 7 days later.
