The day I met you I saw strength
and I knew from that point
that you were a pure woman 2 me
possessing a spirit that was strong
I want smiles 2 replace sadness
what have you found in the past
and how was the force that attracted me 2 u
will take strength 2 will make it last
My negative side will try to change 2 u
but please fight that with everything
It will be your strength that keeps us both standing
while others around us fall
