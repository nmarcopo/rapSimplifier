"I didn't step on the flag on purpose! It's a scene in a video where the flag falls behind me and after it falls it's right there while I'm performing"
"It was never my intention to desecrate the flag of the United States of America. I was filming a video for a song from my album titled" God Bless Amerika. "The clip that appeared on the Internet was a camera trick clip that revealed that behind of the American flag was Hoods of America. In the final edition of the video, you will see the flag fall to reveal what is behind, but you will never see it on the ground. In most people, including mine, who grew up in In that environment, Hood is the only America they know and the only America I knew when I grew up. I was lucky that God gave me talents to escape Hood and see the other beautiful places this country has to offer, but most of the people born in that country the environment doesn't have that opportunity. That's their vision of their America. That was Dwayne M Carter from Hollygrove New Orleans seen from America. That's what I'm talking about in this song. "
