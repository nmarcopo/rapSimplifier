Davey D: His mother, Afeni Shakur, was a member of the Black Panther Party. She was pregnant with Tupac while in prison and on trial as one of New York's infamous 21. This was a time when all party members were charged with conspiracy to bomb public places. Afeni Shakur was finally cleared of all charges. Tupac's aunt Assata Shakur was also a member of the Black Panther Party. She was accused of killing a New Jersey state soldier. Finally he fled the country in exile. Today she still lives in Cuba. Tupac described her mother as a woman of strong character who ran her business. Her real father was unknown. When he was young, he identified with a pimp and little scammer named "Legs" who later died of a crack-induced heart attack. Tupac was described as an energetic boy who always liked to imagine himself in the lead role. His mother saw fit to enroll him at age 12 at the 127 Street Ensemble, which was a theater group in Harlem, New York. Tupac's first acting role was the character, Travis, in the play Raisin in the Sun. Tupac did not get involved with rap until he and his family moved to Baltimore. When he was a young teenager, he took the name "MC New York". While living in Baltimore, Tupac continued to audition and later be accepted into the prestigious Baltimore School of the Arts. At 17, Tupac moved with his mother to Marin City in the San Francisco Bay Area. It was in Marin City where Tupac lived on street life. In an attempt to be accepted and fit in with his peers, Tupac became a small scam artist who sold drugs. It was in Marin City where Tupac rediscovered rap. He congratulated himself on the emerging Bay Area rap scene by joining a group called Strictly Dope. This group featured Bay Area rap star Ray Luv. While a member of Strictly Dope, Tupac decided to diversify and eventually befriended Digital Underground's main rapper Shock G. Tupac auditioned for the group and eventually became part of the group first as a roadie and then as a dancer. He then went on to be an exaggerated man for the Digital Underground group. As a member of Digital Underground, Tupac became known as "the rebel of the underground". Much of this had to do with his excitable and unpredictable personality. Tupac's tendency to stir things up had led to many of his successes, as well as many of his problems.
