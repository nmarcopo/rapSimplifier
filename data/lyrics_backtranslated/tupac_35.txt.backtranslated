How about unspoken love? Is it weaker without a name?
Does this love deserve 2 without a title?
because I don't dare to share his name
Does that make me cruel and cold?
2 deny the world of my salvation
because I chose 2 to let it grow
People tend to drown 2
what they don't understand
Why shouldn't you be tired?
and retain this love of MAN
How about unspoken love?
nobody knows
But this is a love that lasts
and secretly grows
