I can't win, I can't win, I can't win, I can't win
Check, check, check
Shining, shining, shining
We are in this bitch and we climb
Shining, shining, shining
She dirty, loves my person
Shining, shining, shining
Remember the feds were on us
We used to catch them, Hondas
Then we stop at foreigners
Shine, shine, enter, appear
