My [?] With you man, you are in a hellish position
You really have to understand your position.
You have a chance to really become one of the greatest billionaires to get out of town in this particular era
And the only man person, can make you fall in that particular place, is yourself
You can't trust the shit of the outer man to affect you
Shit you have no control, it should never affect you
I feel like I lost my soul, selling you fucking hoes in the drug game
And we did it all double cross, triple cross for love of cocaine
Triple joists, put me on these Balmain jeans
