This poem is addressed to 2 Mrs. Hawkins
who lost his son 2 a racist society
I'm not out 2 offends positive souls
only the racist dogs that lied to me
An American culture riddled with nights
like the night Yusef was killed
if it were reversed it would be work
of a savage but this white assassin was only strong-willed
But Mrs. Hawkins as sure as I am a panther
with Malcolm's blood in my veins
America will never rest
if Yusef dies in vain!
