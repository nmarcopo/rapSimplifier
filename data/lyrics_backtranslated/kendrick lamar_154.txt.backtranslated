Two fired the stagecoach
I glide over my enemy like skrrt (woah, woah, woah)
I'm killing this shit, don't leave me alone (woah, woah, woah)
Two fired the stagecoach
We no longer remember who shot, we finished it
Blade Runner, walking on thin ice, admits he is
Hot feet running, I've been nice, I am, legitimate
