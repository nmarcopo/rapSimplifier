I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more
Yeah niggas are watching me stunted, I know I'm getting all these bucks
I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more
Nigga still get these hundreds, I know I got all of these (everything I want, everything I need)
Damn, look what you started
We have turned my crib into a after party
And everything I really want to do, everything I really want to do, hey
It's putting my hands on your body, just rolling with you
All I want is you, all I want is you
All a black wants is you
The liquor has me stupid
Now, honey, tell me what you want to do, hey (everything I want, everything I need)
Oh oh oh oh yes
Wait wait
She was on the west side, she said she was the best side
Wait wait wait wait
A little hood with a booty like the left eye
Wait wait wait wait
Pussy so good, I want to put on a rap line
Wait wait wait wait
I put my whole face on it, got baptized (woo!)
Plus 5, plus 5, she was so good, she sleeps like a nap (woo! Oh Lord)
She woke up like that with her butt all over me from behind
She wants to do the surfboard, just try to be like Beyonc√© (surfboard)
And if she always does it so well then she could be my fiancee (his wife)
I want more, I want more and now damn, I want yours
Thinking about how we got to the floor?
From sofa to bed when we walk in the door
And I left the door like
Damn, look what you started
We have turned my crib into a after party
And everything I really want to do, everything I really want to do, hey
It's putting my hands on your body, just rolling with you
All I want is you, all I want is you
All a black wants is you
The liquor has me stupid
Now, honey, tell me what you want to do, hey (everything I want, everything I need)
Oh oh oh oh yes
Damn, look what you started

This is why we take their girls and make money, we make money (we get money)
A double cup and a whole bag of pills (why?)
I hear them on the pole and they shake something, shake something (come on)
Damn, look what you started
We have turned my crib into a after party
And everything I really want to do, everything I really want to do, hey
It's putting my hands on your body, just rolling with you
All I want is you, all I want is you
