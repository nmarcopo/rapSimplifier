All studies
Cut the lights
Persuasive invasion, which could cost us our lives.
Head in the clouds but my vision is fine
Looking through the mist, yeah, my head in the night
Audio cardio, jog your brain
Just like I'm Kanye, they think I'm crazy
Look at God and he calls me
How can I manage faith and fame?
