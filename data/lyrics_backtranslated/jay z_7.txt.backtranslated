Psychologists have said it takes 21 days to create or break a habit. On the 22nd, you have found the way.
On December 3, the day before my 44th birthday, I will embark on a 22-day challenge to become completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based! This all started a few months ago when a good friend and vegan challenged me to accept a "herbal breakfast" every day. It was surprisingly easier for me than I thought ...
Because right now? There is something spiritual for me that is my 44th birthday and the chance behind the number of days in this challenge; 22 (2 + 2 = 4) along with the fact that the challenge ends on Christmas Day ... It just feels good!
Then you can call it a spiritual and physical cleansing. I'll post my progress ... Any professional vegan who has good places to eat please help! Please ha. I don't know what happens after Christmas. A complete, plant-based, semi-vegan diet? Or just a spiritual and physical challenge? We'll seeâ€¦
Good luck and health!
PD B also joins me.
I will let my friend Marco explain the benefits of a plant based diet here.
