Ayy
It was destined to happen, the most reliable triple platinum
Link to Mac, link to P if I'm down in Baton (/ and battin '?)
Link to cans link to C, when I'm down in Jackson
I just returned abroad, I was the main attraction
These aren't them, it's me, so you know what's going on
I mean, there's not even a doubt, you know what I'm talking about
Before doing it I said "I have to do it"
And I did it, I did it, I really did it
Flipping cinnamon, grabbing instruments
