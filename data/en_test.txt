I don't take Smith and Wesson
This is a Glock 40 get to step on
21, 21, 21
She ain't fucking around and then she dives
A thousand dollars at Giuseppe's
You better see where you step
Eighty thousand in a necklace
We killed your daughter
I fucked a black bitch
I'm not talking about Toronto when I say I'm at 6
All your boys fucking your bitch
You drove all the way from Macon thought he came to buy a brick
But we stripped him, left him naked, he had nothing but his cock.
You know it's hard here for a pimp
Gun smoke, broad day
Nigga we got a lot of bodies
I'm not stumbling, let them rest in peace
I can tell you about the safe house nights in Calabasas
I try to sell this story, I don't even open the package
I was paying mom's rent when I was 17
10 bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
Treating Atlanta diamonds like I'm the king of diamonds
Man, I told my city that I would go until November and then November came
They made me feel like him again
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the race has been
10 bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
I have been in the house without answering calls
Treat Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
And these days all the girls are ready to roll
We got to the strip club, and all of them girls found a pole
And keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I'm not gonna hit the ceiling
I'm about to go to the club, women tell me I'm attractive
I have many things, I hardly mention them
I am what Lebrón was for San Vicente, San Marío
Girl in that Mclaren
You have to lift the doors
I knew it would end like this, I'm fucking psychic
Young man, but I'm making millions to work the night shift
(Yes) Work the night shift
I mean, I'm back at this again, I'm here again
(Yes) Work the night shift
Young man, but I'm making millions to work the night shift

If you were worried where
I never care where
What club do I go to with friends?
I want Saudi money, I want art money
Yeah, and lately I make the baddest bitches
We go out on dates, I send the Maybach to neighborhoods
Never saw it
Because I'm honestly too busy to drive a stick, I swear
I'm in this ho
But I'm not done yet, a minute has passed
Everyone yelled "Surprise!", I wasn't surprised
Of course...
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (No)
Indian food, she at Charlotte Olympias
I can't tell you how much I love when niggas think they got it
And I love the fact that the line made them think about it
These niggas make it so hard to be friendly
Tryna fill the shoes, nigga, so far these are empty
My favorite rappers lost it or are not alive
And if the girl standing next to me has a fat ass
Would it kill you to put on pants?
Dreams that money can buy
And fuck the one who hates a nigger
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (No)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
I don't know why the hell, niggas, you listen to Denim or Steve
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
I want to see my brothers flourish for a higher purpose
So you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the 80s
But then I ain't got no bumps sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my letters did it
My spirit did it, I'm not afraid of that, yeah
I said to Weezy and Baby: "I did it for you"
Yes Yes Yes yes Yes
Champagne with breakfast while yawning
I went with them once I got going (I went with them, oh I went with them)
I have to catch myself (I have to catch myself)
Easy, easy, easy, easy
I can't say "No" when you say "Please", I can't say "No"
And I'm taking my time, just wait, don't go
You want to drink like Bajan and dance like Trini, yeah
Champagne with breakfast while I yawn (Sorry!)
Work clothes, she's not jogging
You need a young man to guide you
I proposed a change, I gave him all my stain
You let me wear your watch, then I caught your girl in it
The watch is yellowish green.
And I could pick you up from work when you go out tonight
I'll drop you off at the house as soon as you get out of the pipe, man
But don't try to tell me that the dolphin is white
And something heavy on my waist, man, I'm easy to please
All the ATF you know who we are
My wife, my money, and leave me the keys.
But they both understand the pressure of sharks that bite
My wife, my money, and leave me the keys.
Something quick and I'm a good man, I'm easy to please
I keep myself busy (Bzz!) Working on me
I already hit her when you left her alone
She's not the type who likes to take things easy.
I see the future when I get wavy (God wavy!)
I couldn't imagine Braden when he was pumping gas on road trips to get from Cincinnati to Dayton
All of this happens for me and my family.
Yeah i can only tell you shit to pieces
As it happens to me, I start writing the thesis
Franny got Aria's setup like she was a Freaknik
Vegas as Marineland, that great whale treatment
I have to move the safe next to the bed when I am sleeping
You got me feeling emotions
You ohhhh
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
I try to see who is on the other side of the shadow
Because they've been watching someone else's fucking version
So she finally got to Rome
Because all that mattered was impressing everyone I knew
But his last title is "Leave me alone"
Look at the way we live
The only ones I want to say are the ones I can call
You, ohhhh, ayy
I'll tell you like this, nigga
Bitch, I'm eating fancy, look up, ho, it's snowing now
I just dropped the cabbage, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. The league is going to keep it pressed
My black GDK is a thug, he will kill you
I'm piling them up, it's more addictive than crack
Olympic pools of money, I'm glad I learned how to swim
I say you're lucky if your father was a figure
And my mother is very proud because her son is getting bigger
I'm not the type to murder you, I'm more of the type to plan it
I succeed in my pocket and these rappers panic
I bet with this pen you could get attention
I'm just chilling out on the cut, nigga, what, and I feel like
I'm piling them up, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to potato chips
My hoe was gay, now she was addicted to cock
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm piling them up, it's more addictive than crack
I have enemies, I have many enemies
They try to take the wave of a nigga
I got girls in real life trying to fuck up my day
I also really screwed up with my family
But my acting days are over, fuck you niggas for life, yeah
I have people talking, man, like I care
So they can talk about their timeline
Just to tell me they're not really friends
Ex-girl, she's the female version of me
I hear everyone talking about what they are going to be
I listen to fairy tales about how they will run me
Many people try to drain me of this energy
They try to take the wave of a nigga
Yes run them
I have enemies, I have many enemies
We are going to reflect on the year, and LeBron is something that happened, so it will definitely be something that we will address in the program. But just like in sports, we don't try to make that news happen. It develops.
You are also aware of public perception. For example, you created the meme of yourself playing soccer on Instagram, right, and as you definitely did, I don't know how to say it, maybe a love triangle with Skylar and she will probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where will you mention it like you did with SNL when you did everything about Rihanna? Everyone loved it, so can we hope that he is now hosting the ESPYS?
Duck:
Shell:
We have been working hard, as I said, on the previous recordings and on the monologue and on all aspects of the show just to make sure he lives beyond tonight, which I can 100% guarantee will.

You have many relationships with many athletes. Is there someone in particular that you have not met yet and that you are wanting to meet or that one of your friends with whom you have already given any advice about hosting?
KD, I know you're here, I know you understand me
True talent doesn't always win championships
He gets an honorable mention, hey
It's not so bad being number two
Series finished, feel the pain, drink it
Waiter, I think I'll have a Triple Crown
And I'm the only one, I think I'll be the only one
I love you both, you're like Jay and Bey of a poor man
I just received an honorable mention
Allen Iverson shoe offer, these niggas in question
Tryna decides which way I should go
Some nights I wish I could come back to life
I heard a lil, lil homie speaking recklessly on Vibe
Worsened by annual
My career is like an instruction manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
But then again, times have changed, man, who are we kidding?
I'm run by my friends that I grew up with
We'd probably be in Silicon trying to make billions
On how we need protection from those who protect the block
Maybe we should try to help someone or be someone
And then they start "R.I.P." about
Oh you have to love him
Flow back, once I start it's obvious
Your content is so aggressive lately, what's bothering you?
They rap like the throne is the three of you
Decaying flow and I still have a decade left
I have a patio where the money seems to come from the trees.
I cook meat well done in double with cheese
I blame the city, I'm a product of it
You have to love it
We are here waiting, if you are stupid, try it
And where is the cash? Nigga talking about gas money
He tells you I'm a liar, I thought he would say that
It's Drake. Uh Uh Ho!
Look, you should be grateful to women. I'm very lucky.
Look fifty you make love, thirty you have sex
Forget, wait until it's right, now wait until it's over
Wait until I get a deal girl, wait until the tour
But once you have my pants and my khaki pants
And guessing his name, I hope this shit is destined to change
Finding another one just like you won't be easy baby
Special girl, don't leave me baby
It's like I know the perfect girl, and she put me through various things
It's something I can rarely predict
Jason tell me I'm going to have a baby next year
Psychic told me that I will have three children
So at least I know where the
So dance that dance that dance
Go to the main girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh
Go to the main girl and do that dance, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Uh
Yes this is the remix right here
Wait, let me slow down (down) I'm getting ahead (head)
Also, it's hot, so I'm going to sit (instead)
I'm lucky I'm not dead (dead) I'm on a roller coaster
So let me in and release like a time bomb
Maybe I'm listening to things because I feel fainted
F-faded f-faded
Packing sour diesel, stinking like I had some stumps
Your girl has nice tits, yes, a happy outfit
They tell me it's me and I haven't even made it
F-faded f-faded
I feel like it
Check, one-two, one-two, bitch
Not negatively
I just like extremely expensive things
So don't try to be shitting in the game (Game)
We're here rapping for money, niggas rapping for fun
(In this shit but Bun)
Yes, you came all summer as a season pass (Yes)
And you want me to show you, uh (I'll show you again)
You are expensive, do you know?
You're just trying to be somebody
'Before you say you need someone
I want to climax directly (directly to)
Working, working, working, working, right?
You don't have time to rest
'Before you say you need someone
I won't have no business, I'm yours, girl
You will not do it?
He told me that your brain works better than mine
But I will meet you again
I will let you own it again
Over and over and over and over and over
Now you come
I know you know, you know, you know it's true
'Before you say you need someone
And until you do baby (don't go)
But before you do it (don't go)
But no, yes, you don't want to start with me
Make sure, make sure (I need you to come)
I've been down so long, it seems like it's up to me
Admire me
Straight to my face, straight to my face
I don't trust a word you say
I have fake people showing me fake love
Admire me
I caught all that play
Since then things have never been the same
Yes, I know they want to take my place.
Straight to my face, straight to my face
And more melody for your head
We were just walking
Couldn't even have kept me from falling
I think I'm in love
You hypnotized me with your magic spell
Look, previously naughty behavior
Trying to figure out where the cheats' cameras would be
But ugh, Keshia, Keshia, do you remember the old us?
Telling these stories about lonely women that I ignore
I'm talking about lofts and beach condo adult shit
that's why I love you
Can I, can I save you from you?
And that champagne that you've been drinking
It's starting to feel like something wrong (yeah)
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all (* 4X *)
I bet there's a reason for everything
Telling me how you walk away and start again
Girl stop playing, you're just drunk, you just say shit
Oh wait, no, I get it
And I heard that there is nothing new except someone new
But how are you supposed to find him when someone accompanies you?
Talking to myself but I never listen
That is why I will take you wherever you want to go
Go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
You feel like it, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
You only do it by yourself, you're the fucking coldest
As long as they have a small class for about half a day
Time heals everything and heels hurt when walking
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
They get a ballet player, imagine they don't have to choose a career
Like "Voilà!" You do it right, he could buy you a car
I say I'm buying, you reject, that's a little strange
Independent with the behavior of an R&B singer
Closet full of new clothes and bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Showtime)
Uh, 5 and a half years old in boys, the ass is off the hook
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
I just knew it was fine as a ticket on the board
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
They used to be the ones who watched the Ricki Lake show
Too many starting with speeches
And I was drinking in Las Palmas last night
I feel like I've been here before, huh?
Nail plates and files in the bathroom
Spend hours in salons with your hairstyle
I've always liked my women's book and my smart street
I love the way you put it together
She has her own role
On a shopping spree
My girl is elegant, flies and is free
You can never report a fancy girl like me
Shake 'em up at those bitches who hate you with their friends
And my girls from New York, let me see your hands
And my girls TO, let me see your hands
Nails done hair done, nails done hair done
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
And there is no one more real, and there is no one more real, go
Cinderella about to lose the glass from her foot
And we can do the things we never had the time to
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
They want the blows, I play the game
Everything spills like it touches a vein
How are you, Lil Bro? What's up, Slum Ville?
Don't believe the lies, look me in the eye
But I probably will when Hov does
I stay away from niggas that could get me in trouble
Please don't be afraid of me, please don't be afraid of me
Premature millionaires, welcome to my truest year
I should be on top of the world just chilling out here
I guess that means they are few and far between
And he disappeared in my life is bothering me
I hope this is not one of those things forever
You have something that belongs to me
Now you're bringing it back to my face, by the way
And you don't feel anything, you think I deserve it
World, world, famous world
World, world, famous world
I've stopped listening to the things you say
Why don't you mean it anyway, yeah
Maybe we should have done things my way
And that just didn't sit well with you
I want to take you to oasis
Ayy, weird like red leather Michael
But just get ready to make that lipstick smear
I always have your butt around here somehow
Slashin 'as Guns N' Roses
You have options, but I was chosen
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
Charged, my neck is frozen
Slashin 'as Guns N' Roses
The way you like it, yeah
Better find your love, better find your heart
It's more than just a mission (hey, hey, hey)
Better find your love, better find your heart
But I give you everything I have for you and
Better find your love, better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing will separate us
Yes, upload everything
Yes oh yes
Upload everything a little more
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
Just hitting my line
Too hot to handle
I'm new to all of this
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate you, I dedicate you
They throw dirt on my old name
I'll keep you in front, never behind and never aside, huh
You are a real ass woman and I like it
Talk about you like you never leave his side
Let's keep it private (don't say anything)
Dedicate yourself to you
I'm following your example, I ask you what you need
I mean, you say that like it's easy
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I give you my voice
My niggas really did something out of nothing
Make sure the staff is well paid
No one knows when the plan is hatching
Tiptoe, niggas better to know
Yeah well it's too late here
But if they go to war, I'm sure
I would not miss it
Key West Retirement Plan
October Sign the new chain of command
I took a lot of my brothers from licks B and E or pot rotation
To mount the shotgun in a Picasso painting
Trick the sleeves, make them play innocents to get the things I need
Loyalty is priceless to me and I see this
Before I saw this shit tattooed on P and tattooed on C and tattooed on me
I tell the truth and I get to break dreams
So it's better to tiptoe, niggas know better, yeah
Cool! You just walked out of the club straight into the booth like it was light. Break the clink in one take!
My brother you know
Nah really. I came in here, SN1, OVO, Fire in the Booth, Charlie Sloth. Come on. The official. I rock with the officer. I'm in official ting, you know what man is. Go Go
No, you know what it is, of course.
No, I don't want to listen to any conversation during the 18 about Charlie Sloth. You are stupid? Well. Jheeze, jheeze
And that right there: a take. A real moment right there
And that's Fire in the cabin, boy!
When I hear them talk I just don't know what to do with it
It's not natural, be patient with me, it could take a little
I just wish they would let you try it first
All I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks
Taking off like ... Oh
Damn, luckily I kept my wits about me
And you make it look like it happened that way because of me
That felt good. Overall, I learned a lesson from that.
However, years have passed, I just learn to deal with it
She searched the whole city, I let her explore
And now she says she is more alone than ever.
I was only 5 years old, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic
I have missed you before
But I won't miss them again
And I think I realized what it means
Every night is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
It may not mean anything to all of you
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I know I'm not Lyon, like they're my cubs
Weezy F Baby, and I look like I'm doing some shit
That means they are 24 years old, boy, what are you doing?
I'm richer than a bitch without the gray coupon
Because every record I am so cruel
Nigga, this costs and you know that carpets cost
Never LIE, I have everything I tell you I have
I want this shit forever, man, always, man, always, man
I put on the gloves OJ, I'm going to kill this shit
Make a plumber your looter, I can't deal with this shit
The flow is not formal, I do not slack off shit
Bitch I'm back on my shit like a fly
It may not mean anything to all of you
1st sent this, I will upload all the way
I guess luck is on your side
Your wife, your wife, your wife, your wife ... (True)
I can't be near the niggas you're mixing with
I guess luck is on your side
Are you crazy
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Tags want my name next to an X like Malcolm
It may not mean anything to you
I had violated the young game, can you call it legal
When a black explodes, they will build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button (what?) Nothing man
You'd think these niggas know me when they really don't
Chasing stardom will make you crazy
So I don't plan on stopping at all
And tell every girl that she's for me
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Get in my car and I told my driver "to the top"
But why should I scream? This is my theme park
Shhh, my foot is sleeping on the gas
And tell every girl that she's for me
And I'm not even planning to call
Walnuts go macadamia go ballistic, whoa
It can make them look like bozos, wondering if I should spit so slow
They waited patiently for Pinocchio to stick his nose in.
Give Mothafucka back for the way you doubted me, how do you know?
When I get the taste out of your mouth
You won't have a face to save when this place ends
But I understand that nothing was done for me
And tell every girl that she's for me
And I'm not even planning to call
And is it today that you will find your new release?
But we are all so spoiled now
All that shit on the phone shit
Silk pajamas when I wake up
Old number, so it is recovered
Hilton rooms, I have to double
Now they like, "Aren't you adorable?"
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Please one at a time
When you told me not to care
I have more satisfaction going to your head
I'm the neighborhood troublemaker
Yes we outchea
You know that, huh?
It's an OVO thing, huh?
You'll still be mine, yeah you'll still be mine
Tat my damn name on you let them know you love the boy
I caress the money, I fornicate with a fortune
MBA counters, amounts, become ungodly
When the wheels land Travis Barker, drums playing
Tap-dance to my drum roll (Uh)
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Because when I'm not around, I'm still there in spirit
This is my city, if you need something, just ask for it, it's yours
Could Western Union get some money, get his passport and then come
Yeah I do this shit to death, yeah I do this shit until I'm gone
You'll still be mine, yeah you'll still be mine
You'll still be mine, yeah I'll still be yours
Where you try to go I'm ready
I'm on it, I'm on it, I'm standing on these sofas saying
And why would I pretend
I have friends with money, and I also have money
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm making money)
And then we do that!
Someone was on the island
Breakfast at the Ivy, you can have lunch to go
Couldn't have done it like this
Because we can do it!
I have friends with money, and I also have money
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm making money)
You shouldn't have to deal with it
I look around the fellows around me, these niggas stumble
I started to realize a couple of places where I could take it
I want to go back to when I was that boy in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, the pussy, the holidays
We've been talking about the future and the time we wasted
When you put down that bottle, girl, that nigga is amazing
Darling you give but you can't take love
You know we were going through shit, name a partner other than
Girl I felt we had it all planned, I think I ruined the vision
It seems you don't want this love anymore
Who are you accommodating for? Who better for you than the boy?
I know you've been through more than most of us.
Been an East Side ting
Darling you
You give but you can't take love
Yeah i needed to hear that shit i hate when you're submissive
I look around the fellows around me, these niggas stumble
And influence a generation that lacks patience
We could have rolled up a white paper, just something to hold us
I look for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
Who are you accommodating for? Who better for you than the boy?
You give but you can't take love
I wish you could see
So you trust me
Coulda changed your life
Girl, it could have changed your life
Where we were never taught to love
Where money makes the difference
Somewhere between a lover and an engagement
What else can I say now? What else can I say now?
As far from perfect as everyone I know
Fucking in the low, smoking in the low
And I hate that you don't think I belong to you
Too busy running shit to run home with you
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and selfish
You know what I remember and makeup sex is tradition
Schemin ', plottin', schemin ', gettin' money
I have them worried, like making sure you save a piece for me
I should have Spoons serve you with a fork and knife for me.
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort made me rap differently
Yes, Lord, this is the shit I want to go out on
In the mirror while I'm putting all this ice
All I really want is
Ooh, I want to see you
(Yes man, ATF Street Love)
When I decided
I need someone to hug me
I need someone who needs me
So we can get together
(Yes Yes)
You know we don't have to be dramatic
When you're out of town
You need me to fix that shit
So we can get together
You need me
Here I go. I am a rapper turned singer. And you can tell he smokes, but I don't need my vocal cords, all I hit is C-Notes
Money is everything, and everything else
Cash is the moment, women are the after game
It comes too soon, the album is on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say yes, once on the blue moon
I'm just doing, who's drinking because I'm buying?
And my girl is still sad like she's John B.
And when I become silly, I tend to do nonsense
I just listen and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
Stuntin 'is a habit, get it from my dad
This supplement that I have made me feel powerful
If we kill everyone, they can't go to court for it
You had a short salary, and I got a lot of money, I got cash, I got young money ... bitch ...
The shit is crazy right now, and the shit won't stop
I made the decision last night to die for it
Life is always on, man, I never take a break
They give me loyalty and I don't have to pay for it.
In the same way, the loaves have to break
And I put the six backwards, now there are nine
(Die, yes, yes, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas ...)
(Die, yes, yes, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas ...)
First place, first place, man, we can't be bound by that
I only drove it five times, I paid 1.5 for it
Go jang-a-lang keychain, I want to do important things
(Die, yes, yes, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas ...)
(Die, yes, yes, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas ...)
God made a way from me to you
Tay, you know, you know I told you many times that you are my favorite rapper, right?
Uhh
Look I stand out
So don't you think this ain't shit I did planned
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand
And a verse is just a verse to me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
But don't worry, girl, that's just Freako
Damn shame, am I overexpressing the game?
And all the women I screwed get over it
All my team is getting rich, get over it
Pooh, 'Te
Yes
Thanks later soon
Is all i ask
I've been avoiding compromise
You have a fair amount of fans calling your phone
Say my name say my name
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name say my name
And this is no time for uncertainty
You know how this shit goes
Time slips away from me
Where do we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I need someone I go out the front door with
None of us wants to play more on the side
When there is no one around you
Say my name
Back again back from the mack again
Little Me
Leaving the house trying to figure out where the cheats' cameras would be
I'm talking about Long Sands Beach, adult condo shit
Can you hear me, Trey's girl? Go get yourself some autumn shit
Baby I'm the death of a clue
And all these first-rate fraternal parties
Now it costs a couple of thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to progress
And when I give you what I give you
When I give you what I give you
(It's the Prince, look here)
Canadian Visitor, Speaker
I'm not gonna lose
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
The most valuable baby player listen, it's game time
Something like a magician when I give you what I give you
(You'll like it like this)
I need a woman, not a girl because I am for that (oh no no)
Your boy everything was shining
Every time we land, I bet it goes up
Pour out your heart, no one shows love
Yeah yeah yeah yeah it's alright
All nine of us, we just landed in a gold mine
Take care of me, I'm about to shine
I hope to deal with karma before my son does
Take care of me, I'm about to shine
I still have my guard up
Blame this thing that I'm a part of
You need devotion
Through devotion
Clap tonight
They are going to tell the story, shit was different with me
I stop, sometimes I won't, yuh
And still, bad things
There are many bad things
Bad things
They love me
Fifty Dub, they even tattooed me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
I will keep it G
They wish
They wish
They love me
(Yes)
"I just love my bed and my mom is sorry"
Yes they want
I don't think they're really ready for my wardrobe
I show up just before the store closes
Through, what does it do? I am currently recording on a track admitting that most imported coins
Recidivist, Anita Baker
Playing in the whip as they pull me from my sweet surrender
My foot just fits this shoe that fits
When the bursts turned the keys like a new ignition
Because i just sat in this cell
Aside from talking about the day I'm throwing you at you, wife
I'm sitting outside, man, I'm right in the truck
I would like to know the reasoning behind the subliminals.
And ask Juicy if I fly away
They can't but they try, they still get offended if I don't say hi
For me it is a bit gay if I say hello that I like eight guys
Bust them shots, pretend cheat, do whatever it takes man
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it.
Slow down, this is not a sad song
But I can't call it, maybe you're mad because your friends look celibate
But who do I blame in this case
Oh yeah
Oh yes oh yes oh
I'm making money just taking care of myself, girl
Because you would be tired of taking care of me
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh
The good guys go, if you wait too long
Then you should go
It shouldn't take much longer but you shouldn't wait
But the good guys go
They're fucking losers like you who make me do what I do
You're nothing to shoot, you don't even exist
Or write more lies about drugs, weapons or homicides
My niggas, we ride or die
Hatin 'when it comes to D, I can assume you're starting 5
My heart hurts when fools act like a bell
If this little nigger survives, then it must be God
Every time I see all of you retarded niggas you complain
Speaking all that shit bang bang, pull out a clip
Telling you blood, next week prolifically
Shit on my own, I never asked for help
Little niggas get little recognition, you little bitch
Hello Aristo, I'm lost, can you tell me what happens on the streets?
And yes, I asked for a 16, you made your 16
But fuck the money and the cars I drive to set up
You act like your hood and the hood niggas will hurt you
You are one of the seven dwarfs standing next to me
Probably mock in court, then accept the plea
And I hear you pay these women and I have free sex (how about darling)
But dog, how did this start, how did we get to this part?
They say Drake killed him as young girls in a private school (I did it)
Tell them not to call and that even if they require you
Fine dining pour another glass when wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Look at yourself, the mirror reveals
I just made two million in 30 days
With Weezy, I'm out here repeating ourselves
I kindly ask if no one here will bring defeat
This is for all the niggas in my town tryin 'to deter
So you're just wasting time, you're just making me better, yeah
Damn, that nigga always kept it that way
To write a chapter in history, this shit has made me sick
But if I really do, don't expect to divide
Is this what you want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Get over it, get over it
And I'm looking for someone to be with
Yes Yes
Jheeze, yeah
Well look look
Tell me how you really feel
No great successes could be made
But you're still not this
I heard you never claimed the hood
Oh well ship sailed
Who try to hit me with boat fines
Like it's my shirt, shorty
The whole city is going crazy
Target the squad with some traitors
I met my niggas from the basement
This ain't shit got in the way
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
I don't want to talk to you has-beens
I wear the chain like a bow tie
I wear the ring like a fo'-five
Swervin 'off the pan
I'm hanging out, they can't take me
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
I'm showing, they can't bear me
I'm walking away, they can't take me
They think I won a Grammy
In the euphoric state, feeling so sedated
Forest Hill, all dinners catered
And I am, everywhere you want to be
My other niggas move the keys, no notes
Stay on top like I'm caught
This is how I'm giving it
But I can't kneel, cause I'm wearing all white
They want me to go, out of the picture
I'm so hot, yeah, I am right now
Keep hearing clicks when I'm talking on iPhone
I can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone
I have a new mansion, because I passed the condo
I never wash, but I'm not new
And I'm not two and I have one
I thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, no
Tat on my ribs like I don't know what's permanent
They want me to go, wait for the kicker
And when you're fucking someone else
I'm going to end up stopping, right? And by the time I end up stopping
But instead, we're moving slowly, I guess she's used to it
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusing him right now
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her in months
You say you beat me, you always end up under me
She says to me, "I bet you won't, you won't say it to my face."
And hang up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's harder for you?
One more chance to get it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I think I'm trying it now
She is here and we are gone
Could be too hung up on compliments
I started not to care and I stopped fearing the consequence
It faded too long, I float in and out of consciousness
And they want to see me pick up, well, where did I leave it?
‘Because one of us enters and we all pass it (Ayy)
Those my brothers, I don't even have to say it
Now it's something they know
I'm yelling, "Money over everything! Money on my mind!"
So she wants to ask when it got so empty
I'm like, "Why do I have to be all of that?"
And that's what you think is to come and kill.
You know they don't even have it like that
They know, they know, they know
I even gave them a chance to decide
They know, they know, they know
We brought in DJ Rockstar to make this a great shitty event
All the niggas we don't need anymore
Talking about how the weather is changing
She asked me
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
I can't think clearly about the heat of the moment, the heat of the moment
Yes sir yes sir yes sir
I'm not used to settling down
And I say "Well damn it"
I don't even have a strap if you think we really need one, I'm on it
All this is alcohol, drugs, grass, it is everything you can imagine. Man, our sisters, our sisters, and our brothers, our brothers, need to stop this shit. They need to step forward. Young girls are good, and they will fuck anyone anyway, anytime. Because they are so hot and the young guys are doing it. This shit has to stop, man. This shit has to stop. These people need to educate themselves. Women are fucking hot.
Haha
You left your mark on me
I want your love and endless burning emotion
It's hard to do these things alone
You are all i see
I want your love and endless burning emotion
You act so different around me
Just wait, we're going home (going home)
I think there is something, honey
I know exactly who you could be
Just wait, we're going home (going home)
And if your man does stunts
I bet you hear my name in every place you go
Tell me what does
I belong to the youngest Grammy nominated team.
Club owners give me reasons to show up at night
I will kill the game and never send you my condolences.
He taught never to love a girl and only love the moments
All of you little lemon, never ever ball
Yes, 40 hears my interviews, tone it down
Oh wait wait Young F’n Weezy
It's Trey Songz and uh, D-R-A-K-K-E
I'm the only young boy that big boys look at
Get it?
Imagine that I'm not trying
Seeing niggas in bankruptcy is the problem and we're the fleeting goat
They need a second course and this knowledge
With some cool and pretty on my feet
Baby it's about the game
Baby it's about the game
You used to call me on me
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that bling hotline
Girl you got me depressed you got me stressed
‘Because since I left the city, you
Dating some girls I've never seen before
that can only mean one thing
You make me feel that I did you wrong
that can only mean one thing
I know when that bling hotline
You don't need no one else, no
Late night when you need my love
that can only mean one thing
You know exactly what you got
And she dances the song
And she dances the song
If she wants it, she'll get it alone
Throw yours in the air
Because the ones you throw will get it out of
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And she dances the song
A hotel room where you all sleep
Young girls envy the life they lead
Throw yours in the air
Because the ones you throw will get it out of
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
However, that's the shit I'm talking about, like you've changed, you don't even connect to anyone anymore, you just drive me away like a cyattie. Hey you gave me the dog
I always felt that my vision was bigger than the bigger picture
Did I drive in the snow for you? Yes
Cause I'm awake right now (I'm awake now)
And you stayed right now (stuck right now)
You thought the little effort you put in was enough, girl
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Or I was average like that
But how about now? (Now)
I took her to eat sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, we told them not to even plate it
And that's when I texted her and said I love her
I learned that working with negatives could make better photos
Even though it's fucked up girl, I'm still fucking around with you
There are women to call, there are albums to drop, there is liquor involved
Hold your breath until my face turns purple
Do you love this shit? Are you drugged now
Fucking good, fucking good, okay
Damn right, damn, okay, yeah
Yes, yes, oh yes, oh yes
I just hit, I have to hit the next
Boss, I'm the great friend
But I'm a year older than my lil homie
Ok now we have some action
They have to die eventually
I swear I just had an epiphany
I had to count it and count it again
I'm just making fun of the hype
I make my own propaganda
Leg hanging from the ghost
Already seen a classic
I feed my family with this
Don't get along, we try
What's the point of trying it?
I especially hate a fool
They have to go, they have to go
I have B when I'm 70
I don't know what else I have left
I don't let it affect me
I just hit, I have to hit the next
But I am Young Money, I have it written on me
Ok now we have some action
But outside of the verses, he's been blackened
They want to be on television right next to me
I especially hate a rapper
Don't get along, we try
I especially hate a fool
They always die for mentioning me
They have to die eventually
I can't give you the recipe
It cost me 50 at Tiffany
Done
Spill champagne of commercial fame
You're worth nothing, you're not a gang
It's my world, it's Wayne's world
Orange bottle full of tablets
Ok now we have some habits
Because I stop, I stop and I explode
So you know I don't have the energy
Done
Yes
Nigga, what did you think?
Ice cream like 1017
A little less conversation and a little more action.
I need you in Jamaica, chilling out
I thought I had everything, somehow
I want to hit him with something, something
You're a rough diamond or something, something
You have to stop looking at me
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Jeffery)
Ice cream like there's nobody you need (ice cream, ice cream)
Better not give up on that (better not give up on that)
I thought I had it all somehow
You need to give someone luck
You have to stop looking at me
Oh
I could never be ashamed of you
You told me things
Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Yours were the truest eyes I'd ever seen
Could you ever
I just returned abroad, I was the main attraction
I mean, there's not even a doubt, you know what I'm talking about
So make me one, I know you can make me one
I'm too legitimate
I'm just trying to put her in the mood
Because before she pops her pussy, she needs me to ask the question
Knocking on your door
Assuming the worst because I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is taking me down the wall, down the wall
I drink at work and smoke at work
I can't offer much more, you've heard it before
I want to make you a priority
I want to let you know that there is more to me
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You broke up with your man and you haven't been with anyone else
You like, "Fuck these niggas", instead of saving it for you
And these enemies pretend that everything is fine
So sit down if you can't bear it.
I'm trying to tell you that I do this, but you don't want to go there, buddy
I'm trying to tell you that I do this, but you don't want to go there, buddy (Drake)
Violence, you don't want to resort
You can't resist being rich when you record
If your life is a movie, you are an extra
I'm so flying, I glide: Clyde Drexler (wooh)
But I want to hit you back to say
Don't tell anyone what we do
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Like you, I feel lonely too
Don't tell anyone what we do
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Like you, I feel lonely too
Take me to another place where I'll be
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Like you, I feel lonely too
Yes, but with a canvas, I am the Group of Seven.
Because the eager beaver could be the collapse of a prey
Everything is fine, I'm leaving like lights when the show ends
Rest in peace with Heath Ledger, but I'm not a joker
I will roast you slowly, I have no cover
Wet glass on your table, black; no coasters
Rookie of the Year, '06 Chris Paul Fuck
D-R., CJ and Po, I see them all
I don't want T.I. and holidays Vick
Jones Jr. fighting drugs and gun loading
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch broken
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My foreign currency; we are in a league are not
Watch the game from the side, I'm playing calling
You know what they say when your palm itches
Young money in your belly and let's shit
That's right, bitch, I'm back in my adult shit
But I am not the distributor
Yes i am the man in the mirror
Yes, Drizzy Drake, what does lick say?
We do magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried
Yes
Yes
It's Weezy F Baby, come take a shit and piss
Trampling this beat like a damn Sigma
Bad for sows, hat for the rizzle
Bitch named Crystal, let me suck my gun
I'm going in, I'm going in
Bitch, I'm going in, I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
First of all, you know what it is if you listened to Drake
However, out of this world, I'm so science fiction
I'm going in, I'm going in
Gone, wait, wait a damn minute
I don't even know, maybe where my hard hitting ends
And I'll be a legend even when my life ends
And I'll be a legend even when tonight ends
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
Think about the last time I passed
I had more than a gift for you
About to get my bags and all I need is an address
D.E.P. the girl you used to see
Baby come closer, baby come closer
I run this game, just play your role
I wonder if you can handle me
Yeah I hear you talk I don't know who you're trying to flatter
I made up my mind, I-I, I'm ready for you
You don't seem to understand that I, I'm ready for you
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for you
Because everything is part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for you
Uhh, red lipstick on the wine glass, the cameras in my mind flicker
I know you get impatient with the passage of time
Pink champagne, green ink on your tattoos
D.E.P. the girl you used to see
I-I-I-I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for you
Baby come closer, baby come closer
(Background voice)
So keep thinking of you man
I'm ready for you
Nothing, I strut
And I could audition for this, and I could be part of the cast
Pointing directly at you "BANG!", The baddest women in the heart of the south
Tested over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt, more im
Young money to death, I took the road of the carter
I'm still flying, I'm so high
And I challenge anyone to try to cut my wings
The coldest thing falls, and these bitches want snow
Listen and respect, the city almost recovers
Rappers are emotional, critics are checking me out
Also, he taught me how to spot an officer in airplane clothes.
The names I mention are crooshel, you will need us
I'm so sure of my rhymes, I could sacrifice a line
I swear, I really do
I had these trippin niggas, no luggage
I'm still pulling out the Ghost, and these enemies can't stand me
I'm still pulling out the Ghost, and these enemies can't stand me
So offended that I had to double check
So they need me out of the way, what are you waiting for?
Grateful for the women I know
I can't go fifty-fifty without ho
So offended that I had to double check
Jump out of bed like you're possessed
She will try to settle out of court and flee
I'm upset ('Set', set)
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (left, left, left)
They keep trying to catch me for my soul (for my soul)
Grateful for the women I know (that I know)
And when you get to buy, you spend it like you earned it
I thought you were the one with the jump that confirmed it
I know you special, girl, because I know too much
Because I love you and I need you
I need that black card and the code from the safe.
Yeah yeah yeah guess who's back
Now let me see you
Bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back!
W-bring that ass, bring that ass, bring that ass back!
Clap that ass, you're the only one I love
Diamonds hang around my neck, the crib is finished
It's a shame that a couple of them are off limits.
You know the ones we saw before entering.
I know you're not stumbling
The ones who fuck and the ones who are a wife
Don't let them screw up your life
I just bought a pair of Warhol for my hallways
Oh yeah
When I pop shit, never stop, yeah
I can't give you a pass to play alone with my money and my family and friends
Your foreigner is used, I looked for the VIN
Climb up to the top of the loft
Counting the victories in the victories in the victories, for all my dawgs (/ dog) I lost
(Memory)
I-I triples with the bitches
You heard that at the VMAs, you heard that wherever I go
You know what I mean?
And I bet you're not listening either
But look, you must let this play out
Which one of you, which one, which one
Which one of you is going home with Trigga?
Reach for that handshake, got a hug
Up in VIP with all my niggas thugs
You leaned down and said you loved me
To the cradle, Shawty, where we'll end
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
You will think that I invented sex
(Than?)
Is to give you all of me
(I take you to the crib)
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
You will think that I invented sex
If you ever have a question, you should ask it
(Upstairs to bed)
You will think that I invented sex
I am still flying, I am very high and I challenge anyone to try to cut my wings
I'm still pulling out the ghost and these enemies can't stand them
I'm still closing cities every time I come
I guess that's when my albums are sold in stores
He a star now look up, you'll probably see it
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing
S550 sailing where I will be
P. motherfucker don't forget the E
I'm the man from my city who sue me
All I do is lie in the tropics
Just cry what I do is cry to laugh about it
Houston women have wine and dinner and take me home
There is more? Yes
I will let you bring a thousand recruits
My colleagues are a talented group
There's still nothing they can really do
What do you have, time on your hands or time on your side?
Am I missing something that is more important to find?
How to heal my soul, like family time
The beating of my heart (The beating of my heart)
Dogs on this side, dogs on this side
I guess you already got what you needed
You quickly (quickly) learned through me (through me)
I guess so
I know you want to be someone
Yeah it hurts, yeah I'm tired (Jaded)
I want to be close while you chase
You have something real, not basic
Yes, you played me, you played me, you played me
That was before me, I must change it
Most of these things I don't want to say
I want to be close while you chase him (While you chase him)
You wanna hit me when you do
(Back, back, dangerous, oh, ooh, yeah)
Dogs on this side, dogs on this side
26 on my third GQ cover
I swear niggas can't be helped
But that's ... that's where all this ... that's where the feeling is
The music you and I used to listen to ahh ... it was just ...
I Comedy Central roasted niggas and turned them into ghost niggas
That five stars in your city, they know where we are
I heard a couple of niggas hate but they fuck weak niggas
Fuck your list, black lame and skeptics
Who makes a poker face when you pranksters showed me your cards?
David and Goliath, taking the giants
Or that '96 Jay, or that chronic shit, Dre
For these too cool for school niggas, I'm Columbine
Cause either way, man, all those niggas are less than me
When you see them fall
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry i swear
Flip the script as a read
They will know, they will know
I can understand
I keep flying, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
Twenty thousand for a verse is our routine appointment
Chillin 'even if I'm in a goose coat
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
While the Houston send a pole dancing zero
These bitches have to start paying me for this
I have everything, I have everything
Nigga, don't look at that because I ...
Money on my mind, you should think the same
She said she loved me, I said, "Girl, stand in line"
He entered, "Sick nigga alert! Sick nigga alert!"
You need that job, I have that job, I have bitches in my condo
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Tru)
Without help, that's all me, all me for real
I landed in 86, I knew it was the man at the age of 6.
But that was years later with crazy shit
Damon Wayans, buddy don't play that shit
"You are the damn man, you don't need help"
I cash checks and I'm puffing up my chest
I was made for all this shit
I ask you to excuse my table manners
Nigga, don't look at that because I ...
And to them hoes I am everything, anything but gentle
Wear retro shit, that's old-fashioned
Nigga, look what I'm saying, no subtitles
Niggas still hates but it doesn't work
Lil 'bitch ...
Sometimes it's like that
Tell the truth, I can't hear you
And that ship won't sail
Like a damn drive-thru
Now my niggas are rich enough to do whatever I do
That's cut all my time with you
She said you're my everything
I hate that I treat it like it's something
I take someone else's car, I drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
I don't know where we stand, I used to hit you on everything
You're sad? You're sad? You're sad?
They can't decide, they keep changing careers
Put me a bib
He was, uh ... he was fine. Shit is crazy. All the energy out here is changing, you know, it's getting dark, fast. It's like men are on the road, it feels like someone is a target, you know, you just don't know where it will come from, you can't even measure it, man. It's like I'm out of that, trying to balance that to balance my own sanity, drink more, smoke more, you know you stay up so late it's early, like shit. However, I am not losing it, I am just letting off steam, I am not worried, it is too late for these boys to trust me, I am only more worried about myself, you know, I just have to go home.
JUNGLE
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
So if you have to go
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner?
Damn, of all the places you could go
Because no man wants to hear those stories about his lady
I know they say that first love is the sweetest
All my "let's be friends" are friends that I no longer have
I guess I should have tried to keep my family closer
Since you met me
I always saw you for what you could have been
You can't even tell what's going on with you
Here in Los Angeles, I don't know what's going on.
You sit and pray waiting for the stars to align
Someone up there must love try my patience
I guess I should have tried to keep my family closer
And I'm not afraid of not wasting or
You know what I'm talking? Legally and illegally haha
I knew I couldn't doubt it, I couldn't understand it.
It started in the morning, it wouldn't stop until it got dark
Just a rebel to the world with nowhere to go
So come and skate with me
So let's kick
And push
And coast
People hardly remember me in the past
I tell you I was there on vacation
Feeling that the Pope is here, friend, this is recess
Yeah i'm literally larnell lewis with a
Kick push Kick push Coast
Just a rebel, looking for a place to go
So I kick, then I push
Yes Yes
Until the policemen came and said "There is no skating here"
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So let's kick, uh, uh
And coast
I want it all man, I never learned to share
If from the beginning to the end
(Ness on the beat)
I gave my brother a preview (yes)
Love is not in my plans.
Not even taking a chance
I scream at T, he did three
I'm in the attic but still nothing is sweet (yeah)
I heard your new shit and I'm kissing my teeth
Yes ahh
I got bitches in the merky, swervin ', wearing all curvy
And you know I love them breasts, looking all happy
Looking at everything wrapped for Christmas gift, looking at everything turkey
Spanking that white girl (Yeah?), Cooking that Cersei (Dah!)
Now this is so bad, this is Gustavo (Mmm!)
Pray for counterfeits to be exposed
I want that Bugatti, just to hurt
This has been where you find me
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Yeah and you know how that should go
You know how that should go
That's the truth, rebellious OVO
Yes
I'm up first, I'm on tour, I got a girl, she from the south
Every day, I was struggling to learn what life is about
You don't know where you are going
When I appear in a nigga, tell that nigga back, back
They've been gone for a minute now
You know everyone's sentimental now
Seen too much, it is very difficult for me to let new people in
You don't know where you are going
I got this shit drawn hard
When I appear in a nigga, tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, look at a black recoil
I am the one
This other one of your boy V-O
I'm going to tell people that we are blocking this
I can't believe it's just you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, all this love (loving me)!
Girl, I've been thinking about the way that you love me every day
And I want to know if you feel the same way!
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, all this love (loving me)!
UH, UH, UH (UH, V-O)
I can make you easily admit that bouncing
They throw parties and yet they never invite me.
It seems calm, and it's obvious who doesn't know
This is like perfection, although we both got the fair complexion
They keep kicking me like a field goal
Even when the sun doesn't shine, I know you're my sun
I don't deserve, all this love (loving me)!
This is real and I am concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends and any human being who may be a victim of this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I think things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step.
Head to the works, I get some breakfast cause I'm still a yawning nigga
I'm preaching fire, I need a choir, to take you all to church
Saran wrap, anthrax, makes you sick, huh?
I'm hot as fire, do you want to quench me with urine?
It is not as easy as it seems, we went through some things
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits
Then you show us respect, then we will tell you legitimate
From the night before, in the club, false identification. my record turns
I gotta dance outside since these niggas won't let me in
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back north to Montreal
People think they really light that fire, they realize they weren't born to rap
My cousins paint the slabs and blow guns to get respect
Rest in peace for SKUMMY this reality is not fun rap!
Talking about money with me is really unfair
I'm not like these other niggas coming out this year "
Even if you never met me, you can say that I'm in the same shit
Ask your favorite rapper homie for assurance that he knows
They can do what I allow
I'm in, low cut Louis in those jeans and a beige jacket
Hands down the best in my age group
Spend every moment in the studio
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn off the lights
You know you hate explaining how you want it done
Now you finally have a moment for yourself girl
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
So, darling, I'm going to close my door and disconnect my phone
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn off the lights
Me and my black Drake
I received the gift as Santa Claus
He gave it to us for a cheap price, at prices that we could all eat
Since they don't show me sincerity, I light up, I lock myself up
If not, it is as it seems to be
Seeing your physique, the things you never tell me visible
And writing college rhymes, look the excitement is over
Not a problem with X, I guess I'm pessimistic
The same guys used to laugh at me
No copies, I got the master keys
Me and success are two things you don't want to find your butt
* Against the wall like a plasma screen *
I should leave Earth, there's nothing left to do here
Every day is Christmas and every night is New Year
Say anything, I've never been worried about who listens
I tell you dog, I always have the spring collection in autumn
But once you slept with a dime man, you slept with all of them, uhh
Family, money and music is all I knew
My necklace suffers from depression, it's forever blue
Stop acting like teenage girls are my only market
Because these are just the joints that I'm giving away
The kind of life beginners could immerse themselves in
Where those are dark oak floors and those expensive kitchen clothes
That's a 07 but I have an even newer journey
Known Wikepidia
Get a key to your home
Because you're just a stupid dog
The super big A8
The only thing I'm paying is attention to detail
You had hoop dreams
Old young money bills
She will be jumping up and down
Trynna fits that ass into
Because his spirit is free
If your basement is closed, I swear I would agree
There are no copies of the key.
It's kind of hard to focus when the cameras flicker
I don't know where it's going
There are too many in the world
But I swear they're my girl
Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not as the boy who sings while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the only one, Rihanna.
The most impressive thing is not the endless list of statistics, awards and achievements. The most impressive thing is the person. Some artists need to portray a character to achieve success, some need to minimize their own natural instincts to mix. She succeeds in doing something that no one in this industry does, which is to be herself.
She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my ... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I have admired her even though she is younger than me. She is a living and breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and Gentlemen, Recipients of the 2016 Michael Jackson Vanguard Award: Rihanna.
On your back, like Jordan '96, '97
Whoa, very important and very pretentious
You're gonna make me out of my damn frame
But I guess this is what I have to do to rap
I mean whoa, I can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Is it a world tour or your girl's tour?
Yes, trigger fingers become Twitter fingers
You still haven't done shit for each other
The point I'm trying to make is that I never need them
Drake's song lyrics "Bad Breed" will be available when Views From The 6 is released on April 29. Keep checking Rap Genius for more updates!
We don't even go out anymore
Always complaining
I guess you don't see the news
Apart from the fact
You can die where you are, or die where you are
My friends don't even sit in the class when they should
Lend me kleenex now
I hope to see you, see you
Stealing R&B singers, especially if they know where the keys are
Match? it's not likely not an opportunity
At least start bidding, it's hard to fit
They use this darkness to penetrate the hood
Not bad which means bad, but bad means well well well
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go to the head, frame it
You and your entire crew are like a deck of 54
I am doing stock stock, while you work in stock rooms
You fake gangsta rappers a cliche
I'll be all in your face like "Don't speak English"
They try to be what I did, they left the program with
My money is good, I never had to flip a ki
With the tongue out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, forgive me as I repair
I guess he thought it might have been Gotti in the movie
I tell myself who I'm probably feeling
Just because I have a buzz like a building lobby
Spitting a bottomless sauce clay pot
Forget it girl, just think of how to replace me
Well i think i should drop this note
Nigga save your two pennies, I'm not trying to leave you broke
You can't love, but I bet you
You can't do it yeah
The first time
And I put the diamonds
They are not sure it will work, but everyone is waiting
With four walls
Important and vital
I try to explain
And they still claim king
D.R.A you add the K.E hundred thousand and your labels cannot
I will never go bankrupt
Fuck it, I'm flashing the pan
Look ... I have a few days
Until every single made and until every album is sold
And until each string is strung
19 years I've been pimpin 'ever since I bought back Trap Muzik 4 times since then
Holla!
I've been with chubbs through ups and downs
Just like that once in 'Chella
Stay in the big six and big six with problems
I don't have time for the wasteful jokes
Take all that shit with P and his brother
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
I keep it inside and laugh alone
There were no cameras, it was not a pose
You think you know me? That is not true
They also worried about selling shoes
Either going to Milan or going to the Met
I have so many things in hiding
Yes, Link Up TV, behind Barz
Mm-hmm, yeah, look
You know how paigon's chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
The good thing is that the man was not taking out phones
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
We came and you showed us more
I have all the tea and I'm heating it up
I need a shadow mansion, one room is not enough
You're throwing some shit but that shit was a failure
Just like that once in Nobu
They also worried about selling shoes
It doesn't make sense like Jizzle and shh
The phone broke and the whip scratched
They can never tie me, that's a fact
All that bark but we know it's a cat
I really don't like going tit by tat
I just come as tat-tat-tat
Yes, Link Up TV
Man I wish you would
I'm more of the type to plan it
So please take a seat
And these panicked rappers
But can you tell by my prop
I'm trying to tell you i do this
The house looks like a resort
You can't resist being rich when you record
All of these should have
But it never made us different, oh
Thinking that my songs are about them
This is not to be confused
She made me beg for it until she gave up
I mean, you're the best fucked up (Ayy), you're the best fucked up (Ayy)
You know you have a roommate, call me when nobody is there
I'm over there Shawty I'm over there
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Make a black man think he knew you in a past life
"Won't you bring Drake?"
You know everything, other hoes are never in it
Sex, love, pain, baby, I'll be in that tank shit
When my album drops, bitches will buy it for the photo
My shirt has no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like Andy Griffith's song
Feeling a solution, then you really should put your demon
Get it from the back and make your fucking bra strap explode
All in your slot until a nigga wins the jackpot, I say
We could make it really big, bigger than ever.
I want this forever, I swear I can spend anything on it
She made me beg for it until she gave up
And I say the same thing every time
You know who you are
I have you
Drop down, drop-drop (shit is real here)
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
We're far from over, I brought you back just so we can relive it
The spark is not enough for you
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear I get it, I get it, I get it
We're far from over, I brought you back just so we can relive it
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
Your hustle never goes unnoticed baby, I'm with you, I'm with him
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
I have a link on champagne, your best friend is serving bars
Your parents say this another phase in your life
I get it, I get it, I'm working too hard, let's get into something fun
Your girl has a DUI, I'll make the calls to go through customs
Tell your best friend: "Girl, do your paperwork well"
We're far from over, I brought you back just so we can relive it
Your mom used to live in church on Sundays
We are no longer in Kansas
Okay, I just got back from another tag meeting and
And you put all my songs together so you don't know this shit
You, you, you, you, you
And just to see them, blacks have to squint
There I am mmm
You, you, you, you
My name is drake
I have my man Slakah The Beatchild here
My man hazel
You know how I get depressed
Sometimes I wonder ... I wonder if you plan
Calling my ex-girl or sending an email to my mom (Damn)
You are the only
And then wait for favors (yeah)
You couldn't pay me!
But this bitch is crazy (Hahaha)
But this bitch is crazy
And you know that sometimes I said
I gotta get my R&B on you know
I can easily break it and all that
Yes
Rebel, unruly, maddas
Who keeps bringing more? I've had too many
I'm a real damn, could I say how I feel
I need you to stop running back to your ex, he's a waste
I'm real for real, I could tell how I feel
You move with me, I'll go crazy
I want to know, how come we can never cut back and still be friends?
I'm a real damn, could I say how I feel
And get you gold, no sprinklers
Who keeps bringing dubbing? I have heard too many
I had it on ice but then
Look who I'm fucking with again
God
I saw the ice get so thin
Now, does it sink or nothing, now?
Because I am kind to your friends
My window turned blue in tint (Skrrt)
(Blue faces)
I know you know it's in my nature to walk away
Unfortunately i think you know something is missing
But you never say shit
I don't know how to take it (Take it, yeah)
Buzzing your body
Body to body
You said you have surpassed me
You said you have surpassed me
Why are we at Chanel talking about life and shit?
Buzzing your body, melee
You said you got over me, now you got over me
I know, you know, it's in my nature to walk away
Unfortunately i think you know there's something missing
Buzzing in your body, melee
You said you got over me, now you got over me
I'm trying to tell you something you should know
And ahh, my true friends never hear from me
So I choose and I choose
We walked the same roads, but put on different shoes
I sound like the coldest night in Miami
I'm about to go to the club, women tell me I'm attractive
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
I am what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. From Maria
But I'm not playing high school games
Blades cutting through city streets, liquid swords
That's when i have to hide what i feel inside
New (new), new, new, new
Running against myself, but I'm a couple of steps behind
So I have to ask
Is there something I'm doing new?
Is there something I'm doing new?
New (new), new, new, new
Oh girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Or is everything I'm doing too late?
New, new, new (new), oh, yes, yes, yes
I never thought I'd be speaking from this perspective
And if I keep quiet about it, they crucify me
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit Google
They've been falling on both sides
I thought you wanted yours as I want mine
Shit is purely sporty, I need a 30 for 30
Fortunately, I'm great at avoiding distractions
I used to give no reaction, now I'm exaggerating
Wide eyes and uneducated at 19
Drastically changing, thanks for all your patience
I guess that's what we do.
The season begins and I don't want
Now you're turning into crutches
Children have your number because you are the one they admire
And they either want to fuck you or convince you
What happened to things
(Duck)
I feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I have to ask, is there something new I'm doing?
(Drake verse 2)
This is personal.
I very much doubt that this feeling is reversible
That you try to hide and put aside the mistakes
How long will this last?
New, new, new, new
New, new, new, new, new
(Yes Yes Yes)
Remix baby if he can do good then I can do better
It's something I'm doing new (6x)
Did you spend the night in his bed?
Ooh ohh yes yes yes
And how I want to touch, I'm so far away (I'm so far away)
Don't miss, fly with me
I promise I won't forget
Don't miss, fly with me
Don't get lost, fly with me, fly with me, fly
I'm just another nigga trying to keep your money
I'm going to wipe that smile off your face, you think it's funny, huh?
'Cau-'cau-' because you are the death of me (Because you are)
React like a baby every time they mention you
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the environment everything
I tell a bad bitch that your ass is too fat, capitalize on that
The same day that we say we were in the crossing area in Toronto
He sat down with a few drinks, located where he can't see us
We talk casually about the industry.
So blame Mr. OVOXO
The reason why my best friend said she loves me more than life.
But I live a double life and I need to let it go
Full of fame and bury you alive, then I died
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they're all lies
So I asked you how do you mean how do you mean
Baby she looks like a star, but only on camera
Can I tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, baby?
Can I get an honest answer from you now, baby?
'Before I turn off the lights, tell me who the hell do you want to be
You do much more than that for me
Because that's the side that you can never see
'Before I turn off the lights, tell me who the hell do you want to be
May l? Can i baby
Prepare me and let me out
I'm a cannonball
And I hope that when dinners are cold, my fingers won't leave me
And I'm the result of when everything goes well
So many photos, man, the floor is a collage
I'm a cannonball
It's The Boy but I'm still the man, come find your man
I don't know, first you took the hands, then you took the post
On a yacht, me and all the dogs acting like some dogs
We with everything, I left in '16, give me '17
Man, my record deal should be $ 500 million, damn
The same niggas drinking, always dodging my release dates
Damn, old triple double, Russ's face, look with a bust face
I never met, I don't remember who the face was
All that embarrassed shit
Tell your great friend that I'm willing to go there again
Everything in my Bank of America account
I feel like I'm, I'm making a comeback
Or even in a winner's bag, so if you're quick to show off, you're cut to tag
Stop snitching if your man saw a murderer, you never saw him, he can't seem familiar
Uh, yeah, and he's in the south for the summer, I'll leave them at home
Uh, everyone who messes with me I see you
Uh niko i see uh
Yeah richie soda see you uh
Sincere music
It's my year, it's my summer, my decade
Blast that shit if you explode
You could hit him with a stone
And they have to relocate
I'll try to laugh with the brothers, but they can't joke
Blast that shit if you explode
Yes Yes
They will be watching what they say
The skid ends with the brothers and I am equipped to the feet
I'll try to laugh with the brothers, but they can't joke
You build it to break it in half
Just make the call, 22
You build it to break it in half
Just make the call, 22
44, 22
You build it to break it in half
You build it to break it in half
But you never change
Won't even give me a chance
I wake up all night
Six God is watching, I just hope you're ready to face it
Or was he able to tell me to raise my bars
I'm loaded
Let's live to keep this shit alive
Police officers are killing people with arms raised
(High, high, high, high ...)
(Fuck niggas, let's be fucking niggas
There are not too many real people here
And people will be in weak fucking shit all day
Industry people ... normal people ...
You know what it is, every time I visit
I go through underground garages
What numbers do I still have?
Member when you left me in the middle?
The problem is that I meet a girl tonight
So I go and treat her too well
Maybe i will love you someday
On this way
Two-thirty, honey, won't you see me at The Bean?
Will I see you on the show tonight?
Many people try to take us viral
It will be a minute until I return
Let me give you images that last
You go in first with your girls
Women come and go
Monday Sunday
Maybe i will love you someday
Two-thirty, honey, won't you see me at The Bean?
You know what it is, every time I visit
Windy city, she blows me kisses, no
Breaking news, my niggas
Better believe, she's fucking some niggas on that outfit
Bounce that shit like woah, woah, woah
Let's say I'm acting light skin, I can't take you anywhere
Then you find it, awkward silence
I don't do everything for her as I should
I met a couple of your friends long before
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Memphis is the reason my rhyme and speech are slow
I'm just a writer who burns the pages of a notebook, my Rachel McAdams takes care of them when I turn it on
Yes, as soon as a couple plans a trip, you smell like gasoline. I'm burning everything up and down the strip, strip
Shake, shake, drop, drop
This is not last year, money like a cashier
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Bounce, bounce, wop, wop,
Break it, break it
After that, break it down
What will it be like when you get closer to your dreams?
Mr. Big Dreams without tolerance
I cut you in the house and I haven't screamed since
So the p-a-tron had to be dumped quickly
New girl stumbling but I can't drop her
See there's all the others so there's a lonely loner
Every time I go in they make the worst face
I get a dessert plate
You better count on me
Why do you want to judge me?
I never compare them
The city is mine
And it was nothing
I drew it and drew it until the pen ran out of liquid
The ballpoint pen is over
Closer to my dreams I'm getting taller
Yes
And we were stumbling over the speed at which life was progressing
Coaler
And that's the most real shit I've ever written
And "Hello, enemies
Summer time
Winter
Anytime
I can probably tell you a little bit now
It keeps growing
New girl stumbling but I can't drop her
Because you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence on your way
First place is often the worst place
Look at the green chrome diamonds I call it the face of the earth
Better be that real
Give me 20 in the tank on 3
I'm on the range crashing Keyshia Cole
Spring 07
I'm drawing and drawing until the pen ran out of liquid
The ballpoint pen is over
Yes
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF
Yes
And closer to my dreams
Closer to my dreams
They try to be the best
The ten grays abandon
Running down the back streets
I'm getting taller
Whoa
Closer to my dreams
Ah, of course they are, they just aren't that honest
Uh, but I think I remember everything
I'm with my nigga Chubbs, he's in love with street shit
They say it's on when they see me, never come back that day
Thick bitches, they only took me out of four thousand
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
It's like a new page where she and I are starting
Because I have new girls where I could use your opinion
But I would never break the promises I made to myself
Certain rappers would call me to say "What's wrong, though?"
And maybe that's all they do is pretend
Yeah show me love show me fucking love
And this will be the year that I won't even feel shit
They stumble over the amount of people I brought
Listen carefully to my shit, I swear it sounds like home
Uh, but I think I remember everything
But, it's not a copy, do it, it's the feeling, you know? It carries a feeling
Always gossiping and calling
They know how to hold their tongues and I save them humiliation
Just go back, follow Escape'in and Alize'in
And dog, it's always clear, my money is always green
And whose Continental GT is out
You're not living, rapper, you've never been
And I'm present when it matters most
I'm in danger asked Wikipedia known
You don't need it
No, at all
All this fucking ungrateful game
And you know me as Cris bottle sender, check the top selector
There is no way out because I'm already inside
I've had it since "No Scrubs" and "No Pigeons"
DiCaprio levels the way they play that
They even came to my line like, "Where have you been?"
As if I'm about to tell you where it was
She doesn't feel it and I don't feel it, it's too late to apologize
Meanwhile, Drizzy over there, try to make you, make you dance to this
The rest of you guys blow Keeks in the face
I'm way ahead of the curve every time
I will dance you for this
Uh-huh, yeah
Yes
Girl you know we have things to do
I know you, I know you have what I like
Girl you know we have things to do
You know you have what I like
So put your butt in that car and come
Come through the girl you deserve rounds tonight
It's strange that I never called you because I seldom get shy
Look, that was a segue, I think the matter
And if you are planning family vacations, you better know when
Where Cancun college students pour water on their boobs!
Yeah man it's kind of fun spending the winter here man
She lives just west of my street, so we're destined to meet
I love when Voyce sings and the chorus is good
Until we finish sexing and now my heart joined
And realize that all he wanted was that inner love and ho!
She tells everyone that I'm going to keep it down here
The weather begins to resemble the vacation she missed
And it's a shame, she convinced me it could have been a penny
Strolling through the park and watching the winter turn into spriing
(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)
Back then, light sweaters and a couple of drinks could catch her
Instead of dressing up, I walk in sweatpants and jingling charms
He just wants a friendship that makes me forget shit
There is also room for improvement as soon as June arrives
To name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny. No, in that case, you stole from everyone. We all need text messages!
Oh you're fucking shit, I can say, baby
I need a girl who loves me
I need a girl who is going to trust me, someone to fuck me
She walks over to her ex, looks him in the face
I know a girl that I should propose to
Yes, she works with the spatula, I know she loves to flip shit, oh!
I'm posted in the Derek at Westheimer
Any company
It's a couple of faces here that a black man spoke
City tour, it sucks right now
Pop a couple of percs let's go right now
It's getting loud, loud right now, yeah
I'm on a trip to Mo City, I'm a dog
Fantasizin 'and fistin' and change positions
Do you mind if we just mess around a bit? (The flame!)
Mo City travel now
Curse! I'm so Catriona smarter than
Yes, and the visual is amazing
I'm at the private airport boarding something
Put on your poker face, I'll get you a card if you're bluffing
Wayne, if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
I hug and kiss the hype
Well uh
Dad called me Drake, Footz called me Drizzy
I always choose the dough as if it was my only option
And if they're talking, I bet I'm what they're arguing
But I really don't give a shit, you better know
But I'm not with the hard talk
As I said, we take out your card and discover that you are a hallmark
My treatment as Weezy the first week, a point something
I hug and kiss the hype
Well uh
They tried to tell me that I would never be anything but a protégé
And if they're talking, I bet I'm what they're arguing
"There are 3 balls and a strike. Here is the field. It is glued to the center, Revere returns, jumps to the wall and is gone."
Oh the idea is fun, oh the idea is fun
I'll be here just swinging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
Talk about the power of the pussy
And let you talk about the power of the pussy
The same city, the same friends if you are looking
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she was
She calls and tells me to be here before the sun comes up
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
Damn, I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Cause there's creepin niggas and not like how we're crawling
Don't fall asleep on me, wait there
I treat you well girl like you're famous
You just knocked on the front door
I i i I
How I control it, control it, yeah
They don't want to see me find your love
They don't want to see me
Knowing that I would lie for you
Thinking that I would die for you
How I control it, control it, yeah
Gyal rips my clothes
Say gyal dem want length and strength
It doesn't work like this when you love someone
But she would never want to divide a thing with me
They don't want me to give you anything
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't want to see me find your love
Dis is di summa summa controlla
I made plans with you
I think i would die for you
How I control it, control it
Go slower, go faster
How I control it, control it
The girls just wanna take my money
Jodeci "Cry for you"
Naughty aunts my wan you do it
Sexiness you are a professional
Yuh bad like an action movie

Thinking that I would die for you
Jodeci "Cry for you"
How I control it, control it
She loves it when we get wet all night
My says I want to go all my life
When she sings my note pan di wireless microphone
All my life
Mek mi folds you over your bra and your shoes
Do things when you want me too
False ID in the trash, come on
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
They love the crew
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gives us
But seeing my family have it all
There are times when I could fly like 50k on vacation
Tell them I need reservations for 20
I'd rather spend it all while I breathe
Loving the crew, oh
Because we blow like a C4
(If you spread swag, nigga, we news in your town)
Most of the number one, how long did it really take me?
Yeah that's because I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Wildin 'doing shit that's out of your budget
Str8, and pree? Because I always?
Because I show love, I never get the same from blacks
I guess it's funny how money can change niggas
I bet things would have exploded if he had been willing to help
Bad press during the summer on charges
And I'm the only nigga still known to music, I swear
And me and my dreaded nigga from New Orleans
Eating as if sitting at Swish, Sotto and Joso's
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All of them boys in my will, all those boys are my wishes
Coming live from the screw face, living a suitcase
I gained weight, I refused to wait, I started a new race
She's not here now, she's not here now
You can be the one to take control, call me
Spending all my days on the east side, oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Tryna put the power in my own hands now
Tryna wake up and I have you with me, oh
You can be the one to take control, call me
Yes
I threw my hands up in the air and said show me something, yeah
If you already ...
Damn, do you need more?
'Before you said "You are mine" it was yours
22, already had the Bentley four-door
Even as a child, I was already the child
I know I already do this shit for H-Town
He had a pair of niggas in his pocket, now they know
I had to withdraw it because I know I'm on the way
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
Take a flight here, get a Xan for your boy
Long flight home, another Xan for your boy
You could lie about that on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible in your right hand for the child
You know you have ...
You know you have that really good insurance for the boy
I am a threat in a city without legends imagine that a whole Sistine without brothers
See my role models and change the gold bottles that contain more mass than the entire lottery
Let the mind work, you know
I would like ummm
I would like to take the time to dedicate this to someone special
So I guess that makes you Aunt Viv
A little direct me
So I was just trying to update you
Meet the people around you
And I fit into every stereotype that everyone believes in
You need to upload it like shoe prints on the ceiling
And the guys do that and why these hoes steal it
They do the same shit with a better job to hide it
She only messes with a rapper if it's beneficial
Gasified journalist
If who I am He do or die
In fact, I call the house "the embassy"
I study "the chapel", I hate traveling
I broke spirits that I never wanted
I refuse to comply with regulations
Motor City Casino, I am in the cage with my previous license
Niggas coming out of the crib, it's all sauce
Knowledge of niggas who didn't contribute to any of this here
Check the guest list
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira
I love it, I love it
T. Slack, I promise I have them, buddy!
I'm going to be gone for a minute, I'll bring the heat back
These girls with ass completely skip their class
But, I'm not stupid, nah, I'm tight
Let it breathe, let it live
I have to love that
He made me repaint, only to scratch them again
But, that's just the drama that brings fame
The cool prince tries to touch the sky like
Mr. great dreams, no more than 2 months of commitment
He's a G, he's just doing his thing
I have to love that
That's the wrong thing to do
That's the wrong thing to do
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Something is missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
I need someone different
We live in a generation of not being in love
And not be together
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if necessary, but I can't stay to hug you
You know it, oh ho, you know it
(Oh ho, oh ho)
This smoke is fading, and these drinks are super strong
Then it's on
Watch me do it
I will do it all
I am with my people
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never remember when you forget everything
Baby forget it
My judgment is never cloudy
Baby after you
I've had a glass or two so someone reminds me where I am
Millionaire multi
I'm the man now, I guess that part is a fact
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light up your place
Because it is easier to enter than to leave
Uh, alright alright
Uh huh yeah
Yes and he was just practicing
Yes, and I got it together.
I know that shit is an exhausting girl
And your mistakes are costing girl
Silence keeps clouding me
And I wish that time had never mattered
Dissin 'but I have pictures with me smiling
I used to be in the dining room, playing dominoes
Last table left in Carbone, calling to play on the rotary phone
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
To not even appear in a club unless we do business
Especially people who want to lecture me
And frame it like they only want what's best for me
There are true around me
I want to see my dog, but your grandmother is your guarantee.
My life is focused on competition and currency.
Yes
You are vegan but you are going to eat ham
You know what's different, baby
Let me know when you're downtown
I heard you have too much on your shoulders
I heard a lot of things, don't joke with me
Yellow blue scarf oh trip planner
She knows it's not something from now on, oh
Look at your damn tone, boy (Look at that)
The concept of putting money first, boy (First)
I'm about to hit you with work, boy (work)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
Rolling swishers, hitting swishes
She'll admit it, she'll admit it (try a ting)
And like anything else in my life
I already had a Rolls Royce (on the way)
I don't give a shit about your squad, boy (man, that old thing)
I put it on everything, it's a Rrr Ting
Bitch I know you heard things
I can not believe it
While your man is standing right next to you?
But you know and I know that nobody will like you
Try to save yourself as a goalkeeper in line of sight
The consequences continue to weigh on me
I can not believe it
I never really see a future in us
My feelings never passed, some nightly applause
I can not believe it
Wit this new cat, saying he does it right
And you wouldn't need me to recharge your batteries
I don't understand why God sent me to you
My niggas relax, why do you niggas want a ball?
Many records here are not reproduced
Those little tires on the ride, Imma let them stay
So these curious niggas don't know that I get checks all day
My registration is not even finished, they keep trying to press it
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
I'm a little satisfied, why you niggas want it all?
The funny thing is that now you notice me
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
As a single with only funds
And buying fast, you only get the dough when you grind
Do what you do, do what I do
He asked me to kick some new school lines
The driver left and we never came back
We live like kings, friend, you're just watching
And that thing in the driveway, it came with the spoiler
I'm not bluffing, Russian police jewelry
As we receive this document, and this is how we do it
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
My people relax, why do you hate you want the ball?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
To the people who ignored me before this
This is for you like a rerecorded song
I'm so discouraged that I live this, you ask me what's the business
This for anyone looking for cash and buy quickly
You only get the dough when you grind
I'm satisfied with a little bit, why do haters want it all?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
Load all your drinks on that platinum card
And a pen for any meat that tries to get close to us.
Spit out the infernal as the real world challenge
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
Do what you do, do what I do
(Careful, careful)
You know I had to do it for you
Aww man, aww man, aww man
Brunch with some members of Qatar royalty and my glass is all oil
That boy knows that they are shitting you, and that they cannot pass
You should have followed all my movements, you won't notice until later
Just bumps, don't fail, that's for married people
And I have to tell him to relax, Sprite put me on the payroll
Let that man live, they say, "Okay, if you say so"
However, there is no Oakland A, shouts the Bay.
And then you never realize they're missing
So you all niggas niggas can repeat it and get your lies out
Five years later, how am I still the man?
Aww man, aww man, aww man
When I, um, had rap, rap joints out there, and people were saying, yeah, he's nice, you know
Especially when the music is good and they say he's real
So are you aware, are you feeling this, this, this energy around you right now? There are people talking about you. He knows it, he knows it, yeah, how does that feel? What do you think about this?

Jermaine [?] From [?]. The man, Drake, puts it aside. He is doing his thing. It has the best mixtape on the streets. It is early, it is unpleasant. He's fucking it up, you know what I'm saying? Listen to that shit. Do your thing, right?
Me, nigga, what's up? This is Glenn Lewis, man. I had to yell at my son, Drake: the incomparable, illustrious lyrical genius from the only Toronto, Up-North. Thrown niggas pay attention, how my nigga gets depressed Drake, leave them, man. ‘06, you know how we are doing this year. We're doing it big, man. We are about to burn down this whole country, put this place on the map. Let's get it

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
Down to the end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
(Talk to them, B!) If I were your girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)

"He's a scoundrel, George. Organize those parties the newspapers always talk about."
Colin Powell, general admission
"By any means", AK looking out the window screen
Who wants to become my hundredth problem?

"It's called greed, old sport."
"Oh ... I saw the opportunity, I guess."
Fuck Young H-O (hehehe)
30, the new 20 nigga, I'm so hot still (uhh)
I did all of that at 21
I have the correct stock
I know you're like "Damn! This is child abuse, call DYFS!"
30 is the new 20 nigga, I'm still on fire
Don't let patent leather shoes fool you young
I don't have a gun on me
When we get the call, he's no longer with us, he says goodbye to babysitters
I used to navigate the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Five deep in a hooptie like that (like this)
Now I have black cards, good credit and so on.
You young people chase, I'm sponsoring it directly
Everyone drinks Dom but not Rosé (hey)
Already girl shopping in the mall
Returning with Birkin bags
I go to parties to parties with pretty girls
Baby boy I'm all grown up now
Yeah we used to dance like this (like this)
Me and my chipboard
Let me live my dreams until my heart gives up
Involved with cream, you know exactly what it is about
Straight to the league, I'm not expecting my knee to hurt
Yesterday I was needing this dough
As long as your math is fast, if your reading is slow
Then he told me that the Mo 'did it
And you won't miss it, so don't twist it
D-P 3, YES!
Now I'm just scratching the surface
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game.
"Give me a second, I swear," I would say about my rap career.
'Till '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!
No two days are the same except the first and the fifteenth, more or less
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye
And drought will define a man when the well runs dry
And this was the stress that I lived with
And it's not anybody's fault, I made the decisions I made
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is crazy
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is amazing
EPILOGUE
Since then, Oprah and I have become friends, having watched each other cautiously from a distance. But it was a fascinating moment for me. Rap, as I said at the beginning of the book, is basically an art form that gave voice to a specific experience, but, like all art, it is ultimately about the most common human experiences: joy, pain, fear, desire, uncertainty. , hope, anger, love - crew love, family love, even romantic love (put on "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" sometime and tell me that rap can't be romantic - or if you want to keep it on the street, put on Mary J. Blige and Method Man's "I'll be there for you / You are all I need to survive"). Of course, in the end, it may not be the art form for you. Oprah, for example, still can't get over the n-word problem (or the black problem, with all apologies to Mrs. Winfrey). I can respect your position. For her, it is about recognizing the deep and painful history of the word. For me, it is just a word, a word whose power is owned by the user and his intention. People empower words, so banning a word is useless, really. "Nigga" becomes "mono porch" becomes "coon" and so on if that is what is in a person's heart. The key is to change the person. And we change people through conversation, not through censorship. This is why I want people to understand what the words we use, and the stories we tell, are really about.
But great MCing isn't just about filling the song meter with rhythm and melody. The other ways that poets make words work is by giving them layers of meaning, so you can use them to get to complicated truths in a way that direct narration cannot. The word he uses can be read in a dozen different ways: they can be fun and serious. They can be symbolic and literal. They can be clearly obvious and subliminally effective at the same time. The art of rap is misleading. It seems so direct, personal and real that people read it completely literally, like raw testimony or autobiography. And sometimes the words we use, nigga, bitch, motherfucker, and the violence of the images overwhelms some listeners, it's all white noise for them until they hear a bitch or a nigga and then they run screaming "Look ! " and they feel vindicated in their limited conception of what music is about. But that would be like listening to Maya Angelou and ignoring everything until you hear her talk about drinking or sleeping with someone's husband and then fire her as an alcoholic adulteress.
In places like Marcy, there are people who know the ins and outs of government bureaucracies, police procedures, and sentencing guidelines, who spend half their lives in dirty waiting rooms in plastic chairs waiting for someone to call them by name. But despite all this involvement, the government could very well be the weather because many of us don't think we have anything to do with it; We do not believe that we have any control over what controls us. Many of our heroes, almost by default, were people who tried to dismantle or overthrow the government, Malcolm X or Black Panthers, or people who tried to make it completely irrelevant, like Marcus Garvey, who wanted blacks to sail. Back to Africa. The government was everywhere, and we hate it.
From part 4
All those threads came together at a crucial moment for me, the moment when I completely crossed from one life to another.
"The Illuminati want my mind, my soul and my body"
Because when they say too much
The ills of life poisoned my body, I used to say microphone skills
That's right, it's bad, that's life, I live it
I broke bread with late heads
Collecting their brains by angles in all the evils that the game will do
And now we are lethal, infected with D'evils
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
She said the taste of dollars was shit, so I fed her at fifty
I know she wishes we were still around
"The Illuminati want my mind, my soul and my body"
I can't be responsible, the wicked beat me, boo
Stop screaming, you know the devil said it's better to die
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
It is "The Gift and the Curse"
Now let's be clear, I'm not going anywhere
Free, Beans, Memphis, where you at nigga?
In my eighth ring I got Phil Jackson's Zen
The flow is black magic, I'm on it again
Now let's be clear, I'm not going anywhere
(Hov ', Hov', Hov ', Hov')
But keep something up your sleeve that will help me
I'm like ooh, what should a young black man do?
'especially if you don't know my life, don't make me bring
Now let's be clear, I'm not going anywhere
I told you to get money when you see a boss coming (Yes)
To think the shit was funny, but look what you see now (What do you see now?)
And now what are you talking about? Let's see now (Let's see now)
Dig a hole (go ahead)
Dig a hole (Muthafucka bury yourself)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
I'm like the air, little shots go through me
I look at these niggas from the deep
Left a fingerprint, you don't have to be there
So you dig a big hole once
Have we forgotten our history?
Let's open our bibles
You let that man promote you to go against your idol
Knowing well and damn this what I do
There's nothing left to accomplish, I went out and beat (Come, beat)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Everyone knows you better, you lose, you lose
Outside of your league, that's not what you do
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Jay-Z: International
Ice Cube: How are you, Jay?
I'm like a Glock, nigga, I'm always sixteen, Knamean?
I was a boy of seventeen
My son is in third grade.
The only requirement is that you search
Uncool, out of school, thumb rule
I wish I had studied abroad
They are looking for that microphone or some pills to sell
And they roll so they wake up for four days
I used to navigate the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
You guys go to parties on the ice grill
I go to parties to parties with pretty girls
I used to let my pants fall off, don't give a shit
I want tits for fun, you want tits for milk
I'm all leather and silk, your fucking shirt looks like a quilt
West Coast
Yeah putting it down, nigga
You know ha
Ha, it never slows down, nigga
I used to play the block like this
I used to wear knots like that
I probably owe it to everyone, I'm probably forcibly blocked
All the rappers are getting off track I'm doing
I can run it back, nigga, cause I'm direct with the Roc
In case 52 girls come out, now you relax
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
Like the best rapper alive, nigga ask for me
You have to forgive Jay for selling the garden in one day
If you feel like a pimp
Nigga go and take your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you so
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
Haha, Jay-Z
Roc-A-Fella Records
Circle of success, ha, DJ Self
Hey check it out
Dashing, that's my word, you know?
I'm used to having a lot, so mass, I blow a lot
Word up - '95 and always me, check it out
La-da da dah, hey-ayy-ayy, bye ...
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
I did this just for Flex and
Mister Cee, I want black people to feel threatened (uhh!)
Stop crying your clot
So how come I'm still the toughest nigga here (uhh!)
Talking about how I'll be on the project all day (uhh!)
It's about to get really ugly here
(Raise your hands) MACK!
Cop Cris sprays the stick with that thug shit
You know Mack comes with a line of monsters
Until the man has to come pick them up
E'rybody lift it up (put your hands up)
1 AM DJ made it explode (uh-huh)
Let's go, let's do it again
(We will do it again)
"Okay, but it's not real"
You have a little cars, little jewels
The lopsided hat can't see his eyes, who could it be?
Niggas sent two million, then I blew three
Then I skated to four, before I went on tour
I saw the same shit happen to Kane
1 AM about to shake your butt (uh)
2 AM now I'm checking the mix (ah yeah)
3 AM now he buys me drinks (what are you drinking from?)
1 AM DJ made a problem
Newcomer from London ... Paris, Germany ...
It's Euro-Jay ... International Hov '...
As if we never left this bitch ... on top ... it's global ...
Every place I visit, I have land there
How could niggas stand there?
Maybe if you liked
Instead you all niggas flow so retarded
I clean the cesspool
You cats are the sphinx
Won't you shoot
You do not know
The flow changes every 16, shit means, man
How sick am i BK To Philladi-
Delphia! Niggas feel how real I am
It's S Carter, the archer, I throw darts at you
It is clearly difficult for you, what God has given me
In four parts of harmony, it's like Jodeci
My sense of the hood
And a good heart
Hov 'is a good guy, but you don't miss him
You do not know
Don't you know we know you're just running your mouth
(Millennium flow)
(I'm gone) {* the car slows down *}
(Uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh, uh-huh-uh, uhh)
I try to tell them that I'm where hope, man floats
Your Honor, the State seeks the maximum load
And release a lethal dose called vol. two
Known as Roc-A-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise?
Give me, Biggs, Lyor, Kev 'and Russell Simmons
I try to tell them that I'm where hope, man floats
Despite the bleak outlook at this point
Jay-Z is taking over
Right hand in the Bible, left hand in the air
At nine years old, I saw my first hate crime
Climbed on him, at a young age, Jay shone
Fuck the Lady Justice system, burn nine
Outside the crowd is frozen with anticipation
To accept the charges, press 1 now "
But what i will do
Yeah nigga I bet we were kids and we had dreams of being here
Yes, travel with me, your place is reserved, family
I know i know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
You know why they call projects a project
Because it is a project!
And the object for us to explore our perspectives
On behalf of those who failed, my progress
Look, I'm Emory's eyes, keep it alive
All she wants to hear is her boy talk fly
Now we are going to ride
I know i know
MTV, BET, The Grammys, Shredded Linen, Purple Label
Heh, the tail, yeah
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Just get better
Jay Brown and Kawanna, sneaking marijuana
But when you get home you know that your place is reserved, have you heard?
Do you want to ride with me?
Put your foot up
Big Ty, I see you boy
Guru, I generally don't do this but
Emory jones
'Especially when you're dreaming out loud
God knows, all I had was hella hope
For me, something that could see me free was a bar
I was wondering, could a child from Mars see a child from Marcy?
The most beautiful things are invisible
God
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Spending money mang
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Drop, drop, like it's hot
No steroid can make you hit what I'm throwing
Yes, black, P means Polish
I'm Ron Artest, lying in your trash
These weapons are a sun, you will tan with your man
I'm not cheeto, trust this is real / rio
Or where I'm from, in Virgina, we say ch-ill
Jail or coffin, in any way
Snitch-ass they did, they can't catch the boy
Running to the DA, try to get me
I stay real and attentive
Now I'm on the move, they have me jumping these fences
Oh little friend, your defense is defenseless
I know you're tired of the chatter
Now leave it as your ass on switches [Ziip]
Disappoint yourself every day
"Please go back to Rome", you get home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
I said, "Don't embarrass me," instead of "Be mine."
I saw the innocence leave your eyes
I apologize to all the women I played with your emotions
I apologize, our love was one forever and we held back
We are supposed to leave until our backs burn
I never wanted another woman to know
I will never treat you like I should
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay
I will never treat you like I should
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
Put on the same clothes I had last night
I have money plans that come to me in my dreams
Good Morning
Only the psalms I read were in the arms of my niggas)
(I woke up early this morning with a new vision of life)
Yes i'm out of brooklyn now i'm in tribeca
Right on Broadway, it brought me back to that McDonald's
In New York (ayy, aha) (uh, yeah)
But I got a gang of niggas walking with my clique
Welcome to Meltin 'Pot, corners where we sell rock
Yellow taxi, gypsy taxi, dollar taxi, holla back
Statue of Liberty, long live world trade
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
To help them get out of bounds quickly, the sidelines are
They all ride it, like a bus route
"Ave Maria" to the city, you are a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life begins when the church ends
Ball players, rap stars, addicts to the limelight.
In New York (ayy, ah) (uh, yeah)
There's nothing you can't do (okay)
Now you're in new york (uh yeah)
New York (yes), New York (uh)
"Yes yes" (come on)

Across 8th Street, off-white Lexus
He drives very slow, but BK is from Texas
There's nothing you can't do Sing with me tonight!
Now you're in New York. That's correct!
Welcome to the crucible, corners where we sell rocks
Three Cee Lo dice, three Monte cards
Statue of Liberty, long live world trade
These streets will make you feel completely new!
Good girls get bad, the city is full of them
And Jesus can't save you, life begins when the church ends
Concrete jungle where dreams are made
Big lights will inspire you!
There is no place in the world that can be compared Yes!
Put your lighters in the air, everyone says "Yes", yes Say what!
You are too kind
Back to take over the world, now break bread
Damn, your man Hov 'opened the can again
With cheap imitations for these generations.
Now can I get a bis? Do you want more?
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
When I come back as Jordan
If I owe you, I'm driving you crazy
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
Well if everyone wants more of the Jigga man
Say "Hova!" - let's say it!
They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga!
It's so fucking emotional, man!
So I'm leaving, that's how you get me back
They wanted to get attention, new guys
So you have to spit a little something like this
You can't give this one a forceful touch
You can't even drink Crist-OWL in this
You are so contagious, I can't bear it
This is for adults and sexy, uhh
Yes, can I put my adult man on for a second?
Ma, I have anything outside and you know what I'm sitting on
PJ is on the track, Young has air
I have my Gaja 9-7 right now
Lady
I can't roll this boy a little
Sorry; What's your name? (AOWW!)
That should be shooting with Jay-Z, Jay-Z
Everyone says, "He is not an article! Please don't like him
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends who accompany it
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
You are so contagious, I can't bear it
So hot to jog, ma'am, what's your name?
I'm going to give you all the keys and security codes
About to show you where the cheese is, so you know I'm not playing
Have my baby, let's do it
Lady
You are so contagious, I can't bear it
Beanie Sigel always smoking that la-la-la (HOO)
I will show you how to make this son.
Youngsters don't mess with chicks in Burberry filling
Look but don't touch, motherfucker, think twice
It is the R.O.C. Mommy sing our lullaby
Everyone attracted to Hov 'because they know dough
When they see it, the whips will be European.
He is not a sane man, he is more like a reigning man.
It is the R.O.C. Baby sing our lullaby
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
Wait, skip all the songs, let's do it right tonight mommy
She plays, she hates when my name is droppin
How to tell you brother, I will be shy brother
Have fun breaking your foundations
He's finally stopped driving that blue Millenium
If she passes me, smoke that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five
Put your weapons in the air if you feel me
(If you feel me) Fuck them all day, fuck them all night
Damn, now if I bring it niggas I know what
I take shorty for the rest to return
Keep a cut lace-up shorts, off an 8 ball
Seared sauce when you least expect it, infected yeast
(If you feel me) Fuck them all day, fuck them all night
This goes for my Brooklyn team
(Salsa, motherfucker, killing, I say without delay)
(If you feel me) Fuck them all day, fuck them all night
We don't love these hoes
I'm the man fucking the tracks and you're just foreplay
What happens? Keep it faithfully armed as a salop
(I'm flamer 4-5) and (hoe shamer bitch) what!
Applaud the cats, a snitch will give you a full name
Look what I did came up (and) broke a whole game (right)
We don't love these hoes
If you feel me
Uhh, he said where would I stop before I started
"Sorry, God, I lied, but give me one more chance" (test)
The irony of selling drugs is like using it
I guess there are two sides to what substance abuse is
I can't stop, I won't stop, addicted to this new shit
If you make it this big you will put it on the map, kids who stick are subject to tax
Curse...
He's probably going to send your boy away
Now your fall is humble, you are falling, you are murmuring
They are the new you, and it's almost inevitable
Fight and you will never survive
(Ha-ya) My black rose
(Ha-ya) My black turned all white, no stockings
My nigga got that cocaine today
Is this how you feel, Emory? (Ha-ya)
Turn up the music too (Ja-ya-ya-ya)
Super Bowl goals
The boy who used to throw bricks can't be pigeonholed
I told my wife that spiritual shit really works
And old niggas, stop acting like new
No we did that, black property
What is better than a billionaire? Two two)
But that's not even a statement (Ha-ya)
Wait, that's not politically correct, forget it (Ha-ya)
Leave me alone, Becky
(Ha-ya) Ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya
Yes Yes Yes
Like ... yes, yes, yes
I keep it more real than most, I know you feel it
I'm about to hit these niggas with something that will light up your life
No one will fall because they will all be crutches
I'm in the rain making a 40 dollar, hydroplaning, what, little one?
Putting myself in a position where most of these rappers aren't
Warming up the perfect moment to hit your brain, and
Do you already feel it? To all the girls who bought a sash to hide my bricks
'95 South and Daddy on the hill and shit
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
And the tension becomes too thick for my sober mind to cut
Can i kick it (If you can)
Roc-A-Fella forever, Hov 'for life
I do it for the ghetto hustlers because of the difficult situation
For the pain so that everyone knows how it is
I will not forget them for any price
So I'm going to end this here, a kite
Whatever the weather
You seem to pale
So you can say that I am
Peace
I am art with the current
Even if I am guilty
One million
Two million
I come apart
My life can move a thousand miles and hours, reflect me friends
It is much deeper than soap, it is a constant dramatic series
All this shit can make the mind tired, but my theory
(The sun will shine clearly)
I'm at the forefront of this rap shit, the truth is true
Hear how niggas is rapping, does that do who?
But fuck it my name is HOV and you know I'm a bully
They said to G Don't give a bitch No keys or security codes
I know the difference between a bitch and a B, nigga
Check one, check two
Even though you walk in, and I like it
Now please give me the room key
I hate doing it as bad as you hate seeing it done
I think I should let you know that I need those keys
I'm done talking
I swear I saw a light bulb when
This time you're really going to listen to Jay now
But my mind is like a flower in bloom
On the left, the exit has some niggas on that side of town.
I'm done talking, step back and clap your hands, one in the abdomen
Do me a favor, friend, get two ice cubes, I'll pass them
Take that ice, for the best MC
(So far) Go up, go up, go up, wow!
Every time your name appeared
As if you were another little boy, I put on the naughty
But hey, truth be told, loop me, this Hov
Delay like you aren't my only girl when you are (I was just up front)
And Kim, Karyn, Nicole or Ce'cile
I'm gonna make you wear a ring like Shaquille O'Neal
Don't be fooled by my shine and my girl of fame
Reception in Spain honeymoon in Zaire
I need your race by the end of this year
It is true, and if you share
For me it means more than just one night, I, one night
I did something very silly to bring you drama
However, on real, to you my hona
A you a mek mi tink fi call di weddin planna
Because it's you that I really want to share my name, yes, my name
But I'm just being frank
I never really mean up front
But I'm just being frank
You know we don't play stunts
You used to get all the attention, huh? (Yes!)
She wants to crumple my bedding
To bed like a fighter, I had to pretzel her, uhh
But you don't want any commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
Acting how you behave and stuff
To leave her boyfriend, she calls me her toy friend.
She called me his emergency cock in a glass
As if walking with a cane, there is no half step
Iceberg Slim is back to shake a boat, come on
You used to get all the attention, huh? (Yes!)
But you don't want any commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
Why not? You should come home with me
To Shirley Murdock's bright morning
Have lunch, dinner, go back to breakfast maybe
Shawn just trying to keep the friendship tight
Sitting on this lap in luxury
Uh-huh, you should come home with me
Yes
To Shirley Murdock's bright morning
Yes
Sexy bitch, I hope it's her
Fuck me, you know I got it
My bitch whip costs a hundred thousand
Sexy bitch, I hope it's her
Black jack in a casino
But we, the black mafia, will establish it, uh
100 keys on the piano
Everyone knows how we know, I got it
Bad bitch, I hope she fights it
Bad bitch, I hope she fights it
I'm getting big, coming down that beach
It's Young, Freeway, 8 miles, come on!
But I can rewind the calendar
When it was now or nothing
He could hear people now: "He got what had come."
Now that my eighth album is coming, everyone is smiling
Claiming that they've been running
I didn't see you in black when everyone was in a suit
8 miles and running, I got my seventh album falling
Feeding a thousand stomachs, Free!
And the smokers shouted: "One more gram!"
Hold toasters for drama, make Salat with my son
Look back, turn out like sinners
Prepare your brother ‘because you're jealous, nigga
Always rep, the cops watch every step
Appreciate every precious breath, declares P the second gat
8 miles and running, I got my seventh album falling
And my first album comes, feeding twenty growling bellies
To get out of his belly, he has nothing but love for me.
When the niggas attacked me, the industry rejected me
That is why I am taking all the money in the industry.
Young is the smallest, Free is the future
8 miles and running, I got my seventh album falling
And my eighth album is coming
Let me be great
After the projects, we are now on farms
I'm just trying to come under the control of this regime
1% billion more than niggas even seen
Summer legend at the Rose Bowl
Feeling like a stranger in my own land
Made me feel like Brody in the Homeland
Wait, tell them to rumble, the young man rumbles
You know a black trill like Michael Jackson socks
Drinking D'USSÉ boy, this ain't your daddy yak
And that's only half of my warpath
Until we all review a billion, shit, it's just the way I feel
This beat is like you're walking in a place like this
Let me try to get over this here ...
If you are not ready to die, my advice would be
Fast cars, fast temperament, go down faster than all of you
I have to take the shit off, I came from nothing
I'm much braver than most, I have a ghost heart
I gotta take my shit off (get down, get down)
I just adjusted my game, I pushed 20s of 'caine
Live every day as the last, as death is fast approaching
Gotta take my shit off (shit, shit, shit, shit!)
Mountains I think I'm almost certain
So it's less than 8 months, I'm back to work
I gotta take my shit off (get down, get down)
Take off your ass and catch up on that money
I gotta take my shit off (get down, get down)
Live every day as the last, as death is fast approaching
Live every day as my last ...
All you have to do is let your hair down, straighten
There is no place on the planet where you would rather be
But in the blue flame, bitch, you're new to the game
Ears freeze, the team flavors
You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me
Relax mommy, let the Belvy flow
Inhale the dro, exhale slowly
I could teach you how to roll, teach you about flying kicks
Keep your mind right baby, goin 'through mine crazy
I will, holla, for now you are on time
And I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family
Come on little mom, come on
For fucking with me, that's not all you can be
History in process, part three
Hold me tight and call me your lady (say it louder)
When summer comes and the top is low
Come on baby, you drive me crazy (where are all my thugs baby?)
From nothing to Prada
The vice of other brothers was smoke, the mines were carats
The rocks got bigger, the clock face turned blue
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name (and all my ladies sing)
Sometimes you gave just because
But you and I together we will shine to the end
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name
Hold me tight and call me your lady
So she called me "bastard" plus "fagot"
Always talking down his neck, making his fingers break
I asked him what tribe he was with: red dot or feather
She said "all you need to know is that I'm not a ho
Now that she's a Spanish girl, a French girl, an Indian girl, and a black girl.
That's fried chicken, chicken curry ... damn, I'm getting fat
Girls i adore
I have this young lady, she's so immature
Girl so thorough that she's been with me from the start
I hid my drugs from the NARC, I hid my weapons from the sides
Damn, that's fine, but he's always partying!
That means I fly early, plus I know Tae Bo
Put your number on this paper because I would love to go out with you
I come to pick you up in that coupe, sitting on deuce zeros
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll
I have this Chinese girl, I had to leave her fast
I have this African girl with Eddie Murphy on her skull
I'm like, "Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your butt
Girls i adore
Girls from all over the world
Put your number on this paper because I would love to go out with you
Hello to you when I go on tour
Girls, girls ...
For real
Holla with you when I go on tour
So she calls me and fagot
Always talking down his neck, making his fingers break
She said "all you need to know is that I'm not a ho
That's fried chicken, chicken curry ... damn, I'm getting fat
Girls from all over the world
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll
That means I fly early, plus I know Tae Bo
Holla with you when I go on tour
I have a girl from Peru who sniffs Peru
I'm like: "Excuse me Ms. Fufu, but when I met your butt
Put your number on this paper because I would love to go out with you
Girls from all over the world
They do not know? When it comes to love, I don't lie (we don't lie, man)
But right now there are too many fine ladies to choose one (too many ladies ha)
Court! Who do you love, who do you want to hug? Heh
Now all he does is homework, I give him private lessons
In and out, I move through their student union
So she could purposely fail and repeat the semester
Put your number on this paper because I would love to go out with you
Who said that? Why are you stumbling girl? Why are you bothering?
And someday I slow down, but for now I move
O Caine and O-Dog, adhesive tape from Menace
I'm looking for a southern girl who cooks like Patti LaBelle
Vicky covers her boobs, city attitude
Clear a little dark, short, tall
Your flight lands at nine, my game rewinds
Put your number on this paper because I would love to go out with you
Hello to you when I go on tour
I will not say my nose? Can't finish
And you know it, when it comes to love I don't lie (we don't lie man)
I'm trying girls, I'm just trying girls
Who do you know who you want to be fucked with
Hello to you when I go on tour
And giving head is like a whale using a toothpick
Well i'm in the club only for a limited time
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, great city of dreams
Chi-Town beach at N-Y-C
My greatest creation was you, you: Gloria
My greatest creation was you, you: Gloria
Then he died of liver failure
Bad ass lil hov
Two years shopping on Savile Row
You still don't know what loot is, but you were made in Paris
They all go through things
You are a child of destiny
Glory! I'm sorry
My greatest creation was you, you: Gloria
I'm so independent sh ... I could buy Koch
Hov managed to flow although it is not Big and Pac, but it is close
Or Malcolm X-d, distracted by the screaming.
Everybody looks at you strange, say you changed
So it's better for those who don't overdose on being famous
So raise your drainage bridge and drop them in the pit
Accounts that I double, now I invest in
There is nothing wrong with baguettes after you get home
Take care of your home, you can come back and ... Ugh!
The Edgars and Doug Morris-es-es
I saw it all before, some of you thought I was crazy, maybe
The boy talks about money, no need to talk more
The blue baby Maybach as if he owned Gerber
I dropped the same date as the Twin Towers
I still show compassion for others, I sent money and flowers
I am in conflict because, friend
If people were given the free will of God
I'm flowing, the baddest, the baddest, I'm the baddest
That nigga doesn't play, hey, that nigga will kill
I am the best MC, I am the best MC in the world
I really have the ideal skills
Better ripping it, flowing, kicking the shit
To [?] I am giving a little advice, slice
Broken down, I'm speeding it up to 180 billion trillion
Why ask why when the shit sounds this fly?
I see you brought your little team, and?
Are none of you clowns holding firm?
It seems I'm ready to catch ruin now, the heat is on
I have rhythm, I beat them with rhythm, I
Hit 'em and divide' em, I made 'em, get rid of them guys
I'm cutting your shit, hey, it's alright
And no, I don't have it
Don't you understand? Well damn, don't you know my status?
You don't need to explain my name, the only thing that matters
Dammit ...
As soon as I get up, nahhh, every time I'm in it, ugh, anything I touch, whatever I grab, you know I'm going to hurt
Ugh, black doesn't play
(Verse 2)
My name is ringing
I see you looking when I'm crazy, nigga stop riffin
I have the I-Deal, real skills
Who is that?
With a twist on the melodramatic to return, I love the way I do it.
Better in, rippin it, Flippin it flow-in, kickin the fly shit
Do you know that that shit is dead? That shit is dead
Jiggeda-uhh, iggeda-uh-uh, the wiggeda-uh-uh
It seems I'm ready to catch ruin now
The heat is on, sweat now
It's a shame they know I'm rippin rough beat through town like
I have rhythm, I
(Hook × 2)
That what is mine is mine, nobody can take
Released on bail, fifty thousand, still riding with toast
I have all my moms
I'm going with you hard, I'm not going to stop for shit
He seemed happy when they heard that he was on trial, glad that he had been charged.
Also, I'm claustrophobic, back to the streets before you know it
And my word niggas, I heard you niggas
I'm addressing each and every one of you motherfuckers
Fuck the white press, the block loves us, hip-hop forever
BIG. is here, 2Pac's soul looms over us
What do you want of me? Not guilty
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I have all my moms (I am the only one)
Holla!
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
All of you cats can't touch me
You guys can't touch me
I have all my moms
tell me what do you want from me
Come on
Ha, hey, stop playing man
This is very serious
If you also flow like you're crazy
(Come on) It's the Roc
(Come on) It's the Roc
You got it Kris-crossed isn't turning me back
I turned in all my rap chips, I'm earning my bachelor's degree
Trying not to spoil my shaft boy
On the way to wealth through traffic
Every time I go out they put me back in
(Come on) It's the Roc
(Come on) It's the Roc
Bittersweet as friends and foes is
Some are left behind and others are chosen
Tote more weapons than roses, the enemies are
A rainbow then the clouds come out, we do it again
Everything is equal, just wait
You're not even a dumpster, you can have faith
Life is about guns and roses
I'm from the school of hard knocks, you shouldn't
Let's take the dough and be really jiggy, uh-huh
It flows infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
I see your vision, mom
I put my money in the possibilities
I went from warm to hot
Shit, I'm well roasted when my situation isn't improving
I'm trying to kill everything that moves - can you feel me?
Instead of kisses, they kick us
It's hard life!
Is life hard for us
Put Jigga on top and release albums non-stop for you, nigga!
Instead of being treated, they deceive us
Left and right
Che
Yeah keep it better man
Nah nah you still don't sing man
(I love you)
It flows infinitely like the memory of friend Biggie, baby!
Is life hard for us
Those who hate, those who hate; these niggas are enemies
Don't try this at home - results may vary
Who's going Hova
I can't even bear, ulcer!
You know I got it down, dog
Name one thing that I haven't done
I'm running New York
You can't fade us, you hate
See I'm on my routine, cousin, I don't have time to face
Bird ass niggas, I don't mean to stir them
There is no love in the heart of the city
You met me before the records, you never disrespected me
What, are you mad that you push dime and he sells weight?
What you eat does not make me shit; Where is the love?
Uh, uhh, listen
How about you all niggas all fed up because I got some cheddar cheese
The young man fucks me spitting on me, the young rappers catch me
Because fags hate when you get money as athletes
Yung'uns make me ice, ohh, don't you feel me?
Penalty fee; it cost him nothing - ignore me
Sensitive thugs, you all need hugs
Damn it man I'm just trying to make myself
I don't want much, dammit, I drove all the cars
Some good cooked food, some good clean drawers
"There is no love, in the heart of the city ..."
Someone has something to say
And I pack the heat like it's the oven door?
I'm not looking at you friends, I'm looking at you beyond
Cunning-ham but the only thing that runs is fam numbers
Jigga held you for six summers; damn it, where's the love?
You met me before the records, you never disrespected me
Nigga, I'll step on your porch, I'll pass your boss
Men shouldn't be jealous, that's a feminine trait
What you eat does not make me shit, where is the love?
"There is no love, in the heart of the city ..."
"There is no love, in the heart of the city ..."
"There is no love .."
"Mo 'Money, Mo' Problems" - I have to move carefully
Someone has something to say
And I pack the heat like it's the oven door?
Now I don't want to have to kill the soundboys
Ok i feel you ma i said where's the love
Turner
Break up, then wake up with more bullsh
Nigga, I'll step on your porch, I'll pass your boss
What makes you mad because you push dime and he sells weight?
Hehehe, and more bags, why are you all aggie?
Nigga respects the game, that should be
What you eat does not make me shit, where is the love?
There is not
There is not
(I said it's not no)
(No means no)
There is not
Uh huh
Yeah right
Because too many bastards tried to keep going
Do not worry about this
Gather the data until your mind doesn't matter!
I bubble like foam, I rush like the starting hitter
I'll leave the chest open for you like vapors for these papers
My nature is deep
My player's anthem is come and go like a ghost
Jiggy Jigga looking at ravine in the joint
One day when I was traveling on the train, I saw these two children talking
Check it out now! (I get away with mur-mur-murda!)
Yes, gangsta, gangsta, how do you want to do this?
Sadat X as Master P, bring the hook
She asked for it, her man saw it, so it doesn't mean anything to me.
Gone, and that's how it's supposed to be
Check it out now! (I get away with mur-mur-murda!)
Have you bowed to your highness?
Arm, leg, leg, arm, head: this is the body of God
Food, clothing, shelter, help a black man find some peace.
He is 6'2 ", how the hell does it fit in a new Bugatti?
Yellow shit, shit color Jell-O
Hello bitch, it's me again
Have you ever seen the doors?
Putting ghost on ghost, can you see me? You can see me?
I confess god in the flesh
You have to love him, I reach the pearly doors
Niggas ask me questions, I don't answer these hunters
Have you ever seen the doors?
Die for what you believe, only a god recoils
You could be my lady and have my baby
Hello brooklyn if we had a daughter
And drive my cars, and go crazy
Wherever you go, girl, just take me
I'm just saying baby, I'm just saying
But honey, I gotta steal it like Horry
And then I said "Bye Katrina"
The sweetest sight that eyes could see
I said, "Hello, Brooklyn!" Buh-buh-baby, you are (Woo!)
And I say, "Hello, Brooklyn!"
Say my life is too real, look at my ice grill
Ask fears about me, how are you going to do it?
I'm fine, we have some victims to catch
Where are you going? Can i come too
And they couldn't get money from my taxi
Let them lean on the cash
I need a girl who practices Tai Chi
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough, my ladies go
Promise you will never leave me
I promise we will grow
She gives me a good brain
I bet her wrists aren't blue like this, like this
And I'm from Marcy, you catch me blocking anyone
Reppin 'th-the Roc
I was the worst, I used to change girls every day
I let her do it and, in turn, she is making me
This year I am playing well
We can go bowling, it's not like before
Digging, shit and couldn't get money out of the taxi
But the chicks I was ready to crush
But I'm out of that beach shit
Promise you will never let me go
(Hello Daddy)
I was worse
In a matter of time, she was getting on Jay
She used to love you, but today she feels different
You used to suffocate her, watch your honey run away
I promise we will grow, they say
(Hello Daddy)
It left me confused, I messed with girls who was better when abused
I promise we will grow, they say
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
If only we could be together momentarily
We could make love and make history
I'll be stuck with your sister, her name is defeat
As the crowd screams, for the other team
And the battle finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory is finally ours (Lighters, lighters)
So now I'm flirting with death
Took opportunities repeatedly
A success is all I have, unfortunately
I have to lose myself, I have to find V
Future of my past, he will explain who I am
Long after I'm gone, long after I breathe
That's my last testimony
(J) uhh (A) uh-uh (Y) uh uh-uh
(One two three four!)
They say "Hi Hovito!"
That's what they say when I hook up with my people
My music banging like crazy dudes got rap on a choke
Once you twist your neck for a second, your lady is missing
Put it down for my people
Yeah that's what they say when the music plays
A life to live - note that you have no sequel
I really dance: all you niggas are Sam Bowie
M.J., he Jay, faded, perfect
"Hi hovito!" Yes, yes "Hello Hovito!"
Put it down for my people
No, although you all hate, I love you all, motherfuckers
Friend or foe, all my motherfuckers
If you haven't heard it, it's Michael, Magic and Bird
"Hi hovito!" Yes, yes "Hello Hovito!"
"Hi hovito!" Yes, yes "Hello Hovito!"
It's kind of sexy to me how you see it (I love it)
Tonight you will be a superstar
Ooh, it's the lights
You need that (Hollywood)
OMG I know how Ozzie Oz
It will change those who said they loved you to strangers
When your fame starts it's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when the train leaves
Banging, stacking, platinum platinum '
And everyone is warning you
Ooh, it's the lights
James Dean, John Belushi
Hollywood, thank goodness for Hollywood
Hahaha
And I would see you eat it
I still don't know why, why our love is so much, ohh
Fuck that shit they're talking about, I'm the nigga, huh
Fuck fame, keep fooling me
And we are stupid and contagious.
One day you scream, you love me strong
The next day you are so cold
One day you are here, one day you are there, one day you care
Psycho bitches in my lobby
Get away from your horse
Holy Grail
(Thanks for warning me, thanks for warning me)
20 million wop, looting mansions
Well now I rush in the rush, like fucking baby
I just love it
I'm from the neighborhood, stupid! What kind of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your shoes
You would celebrate the time when you had dough
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I'm not a fool
99 problems, but a bitch is not a
If you have girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I have 99 problems, but a bitch is not one, hit me!
Then I stop by the side of the road
"Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little?"
Well my glove box is closed, just like the trunk in the back
99 problems, but a bitch is not a
You know the guy, strong as a motorcycle
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
All because this fool was harassing them
I have 99 problems, being a bitch is not one, hit me!
The new millennium is upon us, the album is here.
I don't like to play, niggas can't hit me
$ 20 million guap, looting mansions
Don't even trust sociable white people, keep the cannon hidden
Niggas try to lean on Jay, the shots will put you on your feet
Who thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?
I want you to roll down all your windows
This is the assassin's version.
He said, "Jay, what is it about? What is life about?
You take the beating for the friend you don't sleep with
You have a war, you have a global war
So ... five ten years from now
I used to rap to the raindrops on my window
And I come with doo-rags to your so-called awards
He's still alive, but he still fucks you, don't cross my path
Take out your CD, come on, song by song
(WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!) Jeah, jeah
Shake the unwavering (it's Hovi baby)
You cannot move the immobile, stop the unstoppable
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm about to start another life
Look behind you, I'm about to pass you twice
There is no living person who can prove it
And that goes for everything from flipping that crude
Get it right, did it differently, did it better, did it well
Shake the unwavering (it's Hovi baby)
Now it's time to rewind and remind you
Changin 'the game, my game could nail Madonna
Live and direct, I'll take it to your set
I have now, I don't care who came later
You are not a factor, who are you kidding?
Who was spending them? (Out of here!)
He fucks me with hova
This remix is for you
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
This is ridiculous! It's stupid! It is impeccable!
Leave holes, the number one positions, when you're hot I'm hot
Oh this is not a trick
I can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
I am about to start another life.
I'm fast friend, I can't get over my past
How do you propose to deal with the perfect gift?
And I'm so far ahead of my time
The more tracks I am, the more I catch bodies
If not, listen more, you're missing a murder
Shake the unwavering (it's Hovi baby)
I can't see the invisible, reach the unattainable
You cannot move the immobile, stop the unstoppable
Flip the numbers over, yeah, the same year I uploaded
Shout out to Big, Brooklyn, I got this shit
Fuck you, you'll pay me for owing me baby
And i'm out
Shake the unwavering (it's Hovi baby)
You cannot move the immobile, stop the unstoppable
Through all the manure in the gutter I grew up in
Choices we make trying to escape
And I don't need no hook for this shit
This is not for commercial use
Don't categorize this as music
Since Frank Lucas is great, but I'm not trying to make fun of him
Other niggas are not in the game, so they practice hate.
Hurry up in any hustle you throw
Hurry up hurry up
I throw 10 G's at him and tell the bitch to go shopping
I'm all about my cake, I'm trying to marry Betty Crocker
Now I'm going to roll dice, smoking a joint
I keep on fighting, we keep on grinding
I fuck sisters, cousins
It's a revolving door
I like Ameriie, you can have them Omarous
You wanna holla, you can holla take her on the road
Z comes after Y, we all know that
Go and enjoy life saying 'Hello fun!'
More than a coincidence, I'm ruining this shit regularly, now what?
Chain him, slander him, swing him fat, bring him back
Never worry when I go, I get closer
Don't fool me, nigga, that rap is getting bigger than me
Before you see me Salsa and Jaz relaxing with your crazy ass
Brothers who don't have the heart, you better tell your mouth nigga
I'm kinder than a bitch, ask this nigga dash
Now he doesn't count because I'm making his butt rich
Now the end is near (Can you believe this shit Guru?)
(The REAL hood, like three pants)
Lowered your high score, put my name, nigga
Damn almost killed before my first album hit the shelf
He has to explain, you think these people want me in the attic
No one gave us shit, we did
We came in this game, we are not apologizing to blacks
We are the reason they don't deliver Def Jam so fast
But it's okay, because they knew they had to see us
Jeah! In my life
So imagine how disturbed I was
This nigga an I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin
Somewhere peaceful for the weekend, now it's time to talk to the vultures
That's because we handle ours as adult men
I was telling the truth and you Tom Cruise
But you don't respect the modest, you respect my dollars
My dad has a liver disorder
You got a hundred niggas on your dick saying you should record like this
Bitches mad at you cause they can't have you
Take my tension and step, take my ego and pride
And I hope you don't think I wrote this
Niggas hard the worst, I beg you to come for us
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes by fast?
So don't worry, from what you see, it will pass
He feels it is his duty to align with all of them
It is part of it to grow
A couple of speed bumps, you gotta take your bundles
Crack was anthrax back then, when
He went to war killing for a living
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes by fast?
Days become nights, nights become years
I never thought shit could end like this
There is a war out, no man is safe from
I'm here for the good fight only counterfeits run
I'm here for the purple heart, if I can't take one
You don't understand how useless as men we feel
Scream at my niggas they're locked up in jail
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes by fast?
I will chase it
You gotta take it, wooo yeah
Mom says prayer, your son is becoming a man
He will not always make the right decision, he understands
Every choice you make you do for your family
Don't cry, we'll all die eventually
But if he's locked up in the prison, send him some energy
Did you ever notice, before you think, life goes by fast?
So don't worry, from what you see, it will pass
If I died, don't cry, my niggas
Just travel, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
If I died ...
Amid the drought, I turned cakes, my niggas
Patinated with the Caesar bites
Jewels with stones, abandoned school, still did not fail
The rhymes are still well written, hold the court on the street
Shoot it with bounty hunters fuck
... don't cry, my niggas
I have a lot to look back on, in '88 I started my crack
Ten years later my rap continues
And tell him you never have a friend
Only family, reincarnated, I will shorten the time
That I expected to be paid, tell him never to be afraid
Black hearts pump Kool Aid and your blood runs thicker
... don't cry my niggas
I am the consequence of pleasure, I never die alone
I cut corners and took drastic measures
If I died, don't cry, my niggas
When I'm leaving alive, my niggas
... don't cry, my niggas
It has been a tremendous journey, my niggas
Find Pac ask him where we went wrong
Tell him that life is miserable when you are physically fit
My game is ultra magnetic, while I'm stable G'ing
So I keep making moves, plus I avoid all my failures
We bombard the world with musical drugs and fly a pigeon live
If you want it (Make it happen every day of your life, baby)
If you want it (baby)
Keep flying from boot
I like computer
I'm dead stain to blow and lit like the gas lane (?)
Ready to die, Roc-A-Fella style by a couple of hundred
Although the player has not been seen, he has been under
Roc-A-Fella Y'all
Yes, we are talking about
You keep cats away from me
You understand ha
I will really confuse you all in this ... go on!
Because I've been doing this since CHiP came out
Looking at Erik Estrada
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick more grass, come on
I'm just trying to give you what you want
They can't even face themselves, don't fear the rappers
So actually, believe half of what you see
Uhh, take off the handcuffs, open the door
Even if you silence it, the curse is there, yeah
Are you saying what I'm spitting?
Let's stop the shit
Nigga fuck shit fagot bitch and drugs come on
I'm just trying to give you what you want
Only the sound of his voice is a success, hehe
Everyone wonders if it's falling
I finish the block and then I do my shopping mall rounds
Only thing changed the queue number on the flight
Relaxed Maybachs, don't even talk to me
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, I see you in hell
I don't give a shit, besides ass and ice, nigga
I have that shit project you want
Excuse me bitch, fuck your name
Can you come, can you give me some brain?
Put all of me on the part that separates now that I'm back together
I heard they love it when I'm harsh on hoes
Understand that I'm the same OG, nigga
I have that ignorant shit that you love
Uh-huh, Hov '
I'm a scammer baby (Hov ', I'm a scammer)
But I know who I am (you know you love me, Hov ')

Mom, give me that funk, that sweet, that disgusting, those effusive things

But don't fuck with me
Uh, that what that uh huh, uhh
Now I just want to love you (You know I love you)
You will forget your man

When the Remy is in the system, there is nothing to say
It gets better, he ordered another round
Go to a private place where we can talk about fashion
Give it to me
(Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushi
Ma, but you really have to be fine
Teacher you love Hov ', and I will never disappoint you
Come on, give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, those gushi stuff)

Come on, give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, those gushi stuff)

We are blocking the camera, it is my fault, I was being a bastard
Larry Gold in cello
(HOV '!)
(Uhh, I know what you like)
(Baby you like ... HOV '!)
(Baby you love ... HOV '!)
And I know and I know
Uhh
She wants that old thing back
She wants those heroin clues
She hell for me every night
In the morning she rushes to touch me
That black rain will take away your pain
This here lust makes you itchy
And I know and I know
(Baby you love, hehehe, uhh)
And I know and I know
(Baby you like ... HOV '!)
Everything you love
(Baby you love ... HOV '!)
You'll never be depressed, I know where your peak is
Now your conscience is interfering, like "Better yourself!"
As if it was better to get help
We are back together, never leave me
(HOV '!)
And I know and I know
(Uhh, I know what you like)
Everything you like
(Baby you love ... HOV '!)
And I know and I know

(Baby you love ... HOV '!)
And I know and I know
(Baby you love ... HOV '!)
(Baby you like ... HOV '!)
(Baby you love ... HOV '!)
Well well
Look, look at the scripts, look at the honey from the whip
I know what the boys like
I know what kids like, kids like
You can stop saying mine
They think I'm sexy
I know what the boys like
They think I'm sexy
No neighbors make all the noise you wanna make
Before they get to the door
Sail around the world until the damn stop
Cop Rembrandt, hang them, pay for everything
I know what girls like
I know what they want
The ghetto likes fat when you braid your hair
Sweeter than your sister Kool-Aid is
I'm talking when the spaceships are around and you great great friends
All I ask is that you raise your glass in this celebration
I remember that he saved for the electricity bill, he paid the rent with the electricity bill
I agreed with not having it all
I know pop looks down
I have to be like the pioneer of this shit, you know
When all of you niggas thought it was beer and shit, you know
I have, I have to be the pioneer of this shit, man
I have bail money, double money XL
You have flash now, but time will reveal money
That south-south, Master P, Bout It Bout It shit
That brown paper bag under your mattress drug money
Imaginary playmates
Origin-al, Jigga is the future, flow digit-al
Still busting a gat when the shit becomes critical
Imaginary playmates
But this year I have done it again, Jigga! What the fuck
Rock plus Versace, it's nothing sweet
It's funny how a verse can ruin the game
You bought a 4.0, you better get your change
There is no platinum in those Cartiers, change your frames
There are no manicures on board, then change your plane
You'll probably get on my dick right there, right in front of your bitch
I'm affiliated with Billy Gates, that's my partner
I see Benjamins and a billion other big heads
Roc Nation Army, millions of strong people and the mantra will be
Jump into the Humvee, everyone can call it Cold War
But I do that, I've already passed, G5 and G4
Son of a bitch, I'm sick!
Rashad misses you, your mother misses you (n-n-n-n-no no no)
All we hear is all the different
We used to party, we used to be in the Hamptons, party a lot
Remember the cereal cake, one of your favorite dishes (I miss you)
Due to the circumstances, it could have been Bellevue
Your uncle misses you, your family misses you
But he had trouble, enough of that lame
I never saw pain like your parents' pain
So professional, our little purple star
Carline misses you, Tiny misses you
By the way, B.I.G., we miss you, Pac, we miss you
You all left a void, there are many little ones
They just studied your streams and watched your interviews.
B.I.G., you would be ashamed to see New York gangbang
Pac, you would feel the same, they use your name in vain
But I guess that is the problem.
Play on words, we miss you, Big L, we miss you
This goes to the memory of all our fallen soldiers.
He did it his way, so I have no choice but to do it my way.
I drop bombs and niggas see me with that mass at eight o'clock
My feet never touch concrete, only street sweeping awards
And get a black project paid for the ass
80% of these niggas with deals
You can't see me with the dough, huh
I need a lot of cash
Oh, you're going to pay me, all you niggas aren't crazy
My crib is bad looking at a hundred-inch screen
It's from a sauna, letting the bubbles shoot up your ass if you want
In my life I need to see a lot of mass
I need a lot of dough
My style, ladies intoxicated by my profile
You need to feel how sweet the skills are
To come and slide down Sugar Hill with me
The big bettor, rolled up in your dice game
I never slept, because sleeping keeps you in debt
Haha, right, Jay-Z lives
All from brooklyn
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
Say goodbye to the straight and narrow
I copied my first key, I froze, now I'm frozen
Still on the phone, discussing my business like they could never be mines
I know the price, I know the risk, I know the errors and the rights.
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
Big Willie chills you when I pass, brrrrrr
I'm talking about big cheese, you gotta go dig these (uhh)
"In my life"
"In my life"
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
Sports cars, the good life will give you belly
Now my poems are not poems, they are bloody when I recite them
Now I'm a hardened criminal with the game.
Still the emotion makes me blind to the fact
"In my life"
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
"In my life"
"In my life"
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
Take the analogy of a tree growing in Brooklyn between steel and concrete with all its glorious branches and leaves, one day it will also pass on its legacy through the seeds it dropped to the ground and when the wind carries these seeds everywhere They could move, a new life will begin for each of them, since they are erected as a monument to the previous one.
That came before ...
The white man owned it, so they owned it
However, no one owns me. "
But rather, how many rocks do you move while you have a watch?
(Gangsters, hustlers, Republicans, Democrats, pimps and hoes)
(Gangster mentality, an American form created by whites
Okay, I'm recharged!
Uh-huh, I did it again niggas
No...
Hustlers that I have met or dealt with directly
But only a single gold?
So I get mad when I catch feelings
Can I have a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
Young blood, you better understand that, we are frying because
And don't listen to the rappers, they floss
Burned the highway, wild miles on the V
It started from the crack game and then so sweet
He went crazy for the rap game, Jigga the O.G
I always knew I'd make a stop there
I'm pulling out, there's not enough money in this game to keep me close
"Trying to appear in the game" "Marcy"
"Just give me the word"
I watched them play, my mind so advanced
Gooden screw, throw the pajamas
Shit is constant, that's why I pack the
Flashy fly little nigga
And I'm serious
Yes, what the fuck!
Clown niggas (yeah)
If that's not a cause for concern (woo!)
There is nothing from Brooklyn to Metuchen
Bought at Neiman's, hip-hop locked between us
Apprehensive rappers stay out of my space like Venus
In the driver's seat, the nigga used to live in the back
Fuck you, I'm not forgiving you (Fuck you!)
You exploit me, you better believe that I exploit you
Yes!
What, we sway, representing the
Yes Yes Yes
Jigga, they can't touch you
Say you, we live as STNR (?)
Pick it up as antiques and let it stack
Brrrrrrr as well
I mastered this quick shit, now I'm moving on
And now you see me nervous, puzzled
I have my feet on your sofa, man
Like a hostess of my open hand
In fact, I reject her, I'm a bolder man
Is that your bitch? You better tell her the cold
Me, me, why are you home alone, why is she dating me?
How disgusting is she? And you handcuffed her
Is that your bitch? Why did she do everything on her walk?
Of the cats that order Cris to play on the floor with the Knicks
It can only lead to something unfortunate
How the hell can you hit that?
Jigga Man, who are you supposed to be?
I'm flogging him in the stomach
Why are you acting so funny?
Bust in her ass
The game does not stop
I can't help it if she's in love with a rider
While you guys are on your grill, don't you know that man kills?
With his hand on his thighs he continues to look him in the eye
Say, "Hey, I'm new to town, I don't know my way
FYI, they never stole from me in my life "
Let me introduce you around town like your man
Are you still in Brooklyn?
Jigga Man, holla {* click *, * dial tone *}
Don't get cool, let them know your little change
I want to speak to myself directly, hit trey-pound extension, I'm out
What seems to be the problem, young man?
Shut your mouth! In fact wait
When you talk to husbands on the phone
Never hold on, take off, throw heat and get out
Pass the number until you are stacking balls
I take cash or write the check to F-R
A little baking soda to make you Hova "
I'm addicted to gambling
Shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot
Full belly, I can't shake it
Hunger in my belly has been replaced by other forms of hunger
And I'm fine with it
It's sad but it's true, but blacks' ass will turn blue
You won't let me lose it, until it's indisputable
Speeches I prepared to never speak
There must have been some pain in your past too
It must have been expired karma
I never treated my brother like a step, dad
What were you preparing for us?
By?
Leader of the pack, you see it in your youngins
I shoot trash in your arms, more than your veins were pierced
I hit the feelings because you said you would come
You couldn't kick the habit, I wish you would say something
You cannot avenge these many sins with your own hands
I am grateful to receive all these gifts to unwrap
Last night I had a dream, thoughts went through my head
He agreed with his head, just nodded like this
"I agree", I said, "my only me"
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
Hang pictures on my wall
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
"I have the whole industry mad at me," I said.
And I'm aiming for the pennant
And I've been this, God made me
It is the return of the Messiah
No, I'm not God, but I've been made in your mold
I just double bread
So the next motherfucker can earn his salary
He is an adult man, you are a baby to him.
I spent it on furniture
I have Basquiats in the lobby of my place
Timbo on the track, 250 for the rhythm
I spent a couple million just to lose to the Heat
And I will never, never return, I will return
Whoever raps, you will practice, nigga
I'm the rapper of a rapper
You should know that you are completely respected by me
Plotting, shit, the first chance to break the bank
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Find your death in less than 8 seconds
Still pounding in my life after life
Sleep but it gives me a lot
Friends will tell me that I should leave you alone
With speed, I make the best bitch see the way out, actually
You get the keys to the driverless Lexus
You have to look at your friends, you have to look at me, they collude
It's time to kill him in your belly without a doubt
I had more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon
So when you shoot find your death in less than 8 seconds
Friends will tell me that I should leave you alone
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Looking half black and filipino, pretending nothing
You know these hoes are making me weak
Chrome spinning edge keeps them smiling
I play hard until they say "God
Nigga, control, what you don't see is what you get
Hidden weapons, what the fuck do they feel
When black people play sick we can all get sick
Fox Brown .. (what's up?)
Sleep but it gives me a lot
Friends will tell me that I should leave you alone
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Own man, own man)
I, there is nothing to stop, this is not a lie
Bank rolls and shit, massages in the French tubs
Remember the days you were dead broken
So who is the player? I still keep you on the smallest crocodiles
Custom made so we can lie down in the shade remembering
On how I fuck better and shit
Before this rap shit, when you were in leather and shit Berettas
Now all your men are in your Benz
I took a little when you were up north, your commissary stays pilin '
Fuck no, I see half of that mass
There's no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
(Keeps you in diamonds and fur)
Friends will tell me that I should leave you alone
(Tell the monsters to find a man of their own
You have to look at your friends, you have to look at me
Mmet your death in less than 8 seconds
No one can fuck you betta
Tell the monsters to find a man of their own
You cannot change a player's game in the ninth inning
Keeps it real, jigga, stays tough
When a nigga plays sick, we can all get sick
Chorus
So who the beach? I still keep you on the smallest crocodiles
Especially when I'm flipping Baileys
I push the disease, eating shrimp with larger than life diamond rocks
I have you in front with Armani sweaters
Playing inside my pubic hairs
I took a little when you were up north
Make you wonder a star
Chorus
It's not necessary ... so you never sweat the next bitch
And keep your butt tighter than Versace, that's why
They test me, all they get is 50 cents franc
Laugin my shit is tight
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Lookin half black and filipino fakin no jacks
Surrounding your feet at Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan
Yall knows how it goes, so I crawl
You cannot change a player's game in the ninth inning
Twist chrome trim keeps them smiling
I play hard until God say ...
Hidden weapons what everyone feels
-What is the deal-
I promise to stay monogamous, I try
Everyone knows how B is going, so I stay deep
What's up, just keep me intertwined with the illa snakes
Flippin weight ... heroin and shit
I push Da Z, eating garlic shrimp with rocks bigger than life
I took a little when you were up north
Your curator stays pilin
Fuck no, I see half the dough
Killer Cali, nigga (same song)
And all the points between them know about your man
Konichiwa ladies when I'm in Japan
Now I bounce six or four up and down on Crenshaw
And driving a model, standing around five-eight
Then it's back home, nigga, back to the area
A couple of boyfriends, I'm the new DeVante
A ticket and your favorite CD - Sweet Sade
Sade, Sade, don't you know that I love you sweet Sade, Sade
Real pranksters in Chi, most of them real people
So we party like the sun doesn't go down
{* harmonizing to the end *}
It's the Roc! Wooo!
The whole industry can hate me, I made my way
Candy Blowing Candy Drops Swisher
And learn how to win better, I burn cheddar
I blow smoke on your face, I burn rubber off the tires
On a sunny day some girls want to play
Come now
I'm a little two-two, I call her Peggy Sue
Because today they are very bad, everyone saw you
In this age what is a real muh'fucka to do
R to O to C comin 'truth
Armadale in the club, a pair of duckets (yeah)
A couple of girls next to me, let's ride
All the Roc is jumping, we reached our zenith
I got demons throwing up on themselves like Willie Beamen (hehe hehe)
Dikembe Mutumbo from this rap shit
Also, the jab is sick, and he is fast Zab
Half spoon ... (uh huh)
A rag and a pocket full of loot (I have them)
Broad Street Bully
Young! (Everything I need) H al izzo
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
(All I need)
Known for dancing harder, holding our own in our post
Known for soaking up, sending hoes at your expense
Climbing on them hoes
I remind you of that mass
I i
I'm still hot, I'm still S.
I'll stay warm no matter what my shit does
I am the child of destiny, my destiny has been sealed
But my theory is that the sun shines clearly
Untouchable, I can't fuck with friend
Spit duck, shake your arm, who wants to play?
Flow is like sniffin 'hundred grams
Jigga, what
Jigga, what
Flow like no other, I'm the baddest, hardest point, made of butcher
(Young! It's life)
Get so high oh, so high, high in life
I have a thing for the great Benzes, it dulls my senses
I put my feet on the footprints they left me
Stay away from hoes, lower the toast
Light the pot, make a souffle
Say "hurray" to the bad boy, and all the boys
All in the name of love
Just to see that love locked up and the family came
To all the lauras in the world, I feel your pain
Called me back
And you can treat your nose and still you won't come close
Doors are raised off the floor and covers are removed
Yes i said it's life
Man I'm out of life, fuck it, I'm lost
Man it's just a game, just game to play it
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa ... it's real
Mix the water with the soda
All in the name of love
Learn that you are the lover only after that love is killed
Now it becomes hard to love again
To all the lauras in the world, I feel your pain
Going through one thing I guess brings out the best in me
But I am far from my reach like Abdul-Jabbar
I'm so into this life, you know who I am
Every corner, every hood, black ghetto superstar
Either you love me or you leave me alone
Fall from above (above)
The shit I'm in (hey)
Hey i'm home
Now one more gin
They want me to stop (no)
They want me to go (no)
Hey i'm home
They want me to stop (stop)
Hey i'm home
Not in the same league, don't shoot the same baskets
Half man half mammal, my sign is a buckling
This is just what I planned to do, oh don't be mad
Oh they want me to fall (fall)
The shit I'm in (hey)
Hey i'm home
I am a work of art, I am already a Warhol
H-O-V, I have my own lane, ya (ya)
I've already cooked the rock
So why the fuck can't they heat up already? (Already)
Put your name in the pot now
And I'm black, I'm already home (already)
They want me to fall (fall)
I already left (I left)
I'm home
Hey i'm home
Hey i'm home
Jigga, uhh uhh uhh, uh-huh
Pa-pa, uhh, pa-pa, uhh
The G, Roc-A-Fella, all of you
Drinking sake, it's me and my mommy with the doobie
Properly, in Versace pants, arrogant posture with bowed legs
A thing of beauty, look at me, crazy body
"Surely you're kidding," he said, "if you thought I was purely
Touch me with a heart of gold (uh-huh)
From the lows, to the highs, to the enemies we shine
Touch me with a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, my sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)
Touch me with a heart of gold
Touch me with a golden smile
I can't go a day without my sun, sun
I could let you kick it if you don't tell the lady
Quick, run, before the tabloids come
Tell me if this is true
I would like to extend an invitation
I dreamed of you this morning
I never felt that before
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Forgive me mom, I should be thinking about Harvard
There is nothing wrong with my goal, I just have to change the goal
Life is a bitch, I hope I don't make her a widow
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
(I'm just an American dream)
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
But there always is, that's it, that's it baby
Like Tony La Russa on how you play your cards
Now let's start, on your brand
This is an intensive course, not high school
I never felt that before
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
I never felt that before
And the police come, could you read that they care
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
I'm from the 80s
Her-on start
So it's easy to see where my whole plan comes from
American dream, I'm still living life
I hear your voice in my mind like, live black
I give it to my children
The rest of my belongings belong to the hall of fame.
If the sky fell
And everything goes tomorrow and they close the house
In Ibiza I had pizza at the club.
Ladies know I'm that guy, they want a piece of my love
Now they want to make your boy like Mike at his best
I can't lie, they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes
Throwing the diamond upwards, representing the logo
Here's the man who refused to give up
I want the black sky, chuuurch
I want heaven baby
Uh-huh, I did it again niggas
Ugh! Nice watch, do you really have a place?
As you said in "Friend or Foe", and if so, what block?
What you do in Los Angeles, with Filipinos and Eses
BLAOW!
Four days a week meet me in the kitchen
Daddy gave me a cake, but it cooks like two
The cats around me were buying whips and new things
Looking like blue lasers, never fleeting-is
Act brave, hit them with the two aces
So you all know who is the best: Jigga!
So when I take flight, it's from Hangar 6
Then I go out, break your block and start like soccer
In a Range Rove, turn hoes like ankles
I hit them with a million more
Looking at me all funny, while I count my money
Sure, all for the dough now
Get wet by the sleeve that leaves the bezel out
Do you not like it? Sue me, fuck, I'll settle
Ghetto'd in the Folded Vehicle
What I do is already legalized
Spiritual and mental, what I've been through
Nothing has changed, but the players, the game remains the same
Layin there trembling, the middle of the night
Blowing like Tahitii, roll NYPD
And pagers, rolling ten deep to Las Vegas
Assembled mills, feeding the villages, from the bridge to Dequatas
But now, two years, five months, and 30 days later
You have to let it hit
If you die I will keep it like mine
I'd risk everything
Anything for you
I know mom, your little baby
"Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them"
Thanks for putting up with the house when times were bad
That was not the life for you
Yes, I would do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
Put my face on his body, don't wait for anyone
Stand on your own two, do your shit man
Don't listen to your team, do what works for you
You see the snakes in the grass and wait on their butt
If you're wrong my nigga
Yes, I would do anything (Anything?)
Roc-a-fella you
Big monster, all of you
Thirty-eight waist enough to keep a nine
But when the kitten is in, I'm fat as shit
No kids, but trust me, I know how to lift a gun
Niggas who think I spend my days in the sun
Don't tell me about MC skills
Jay Z is that deal, I'll be out in the field
But none of you rappers can trick me
With that new blue Yankee, who but me?
Yes, I blew, a few million I blew three
And I'd name names but they're not that important to that
Homies throwing me shade is not sunny shit
I'm a scammer, accept that
There are no correctional facilities that can correct that.
I have to escape, some tried to return
Three smart niggas left behind
Not before Christ, but a long time friend
I'm in the back, I have my classmates with me
Haha, keep that
Through traffic lights fucks traffic at night
Here we have the best moment of life.
It's just the clarise
I have my (shh) out of town
Whatever you want girl
Ooh, you're so nasty, pole dancing hobbyist
She tried to dance the rain, money so long it'll drown you girl
Buried under so many piles
Whatever you want girl
And I will grant you all your wishes
You turned my Maybach seat into the Hotel De'Paris
You know you know you're burning like fire
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
In Matrix be patient, I have many bottles
I'm a D boy, they attract, their money is lighter
Whatever you want girl
You know, you know, you know (you're hot)
Just put it on the floor baby
I bet you've never seen him like this
Just stay on that floor girl
I really like it when you bounce, bounce
Yes. Thank you. Thank my Lord.
And Bruce Springsteen ...
Can you imagine, is that where the country was? Only she had her arm ... and you see the look in her eyes, it's like, "You know, you silly English, you're going to lynch me." I'm just putting it in perspective; that's where it comes from.
I feel like a lot of this record is about the love / hate relationship you have with fame, certainly that first song, the title track.
"Holy Grail", it is about recognizing that you are dancing with this drug, you know, and that people have lost their lives behind it, you know, this thing of fame, and where to draw the line and how to maintain a sense from within you. We look at all the people who came before us who are no longer here with us, you know, who have been in this dance with fame. And it's just me really thinking out loud and vocalizing and hopefully dealing with it somehow. It is like my therapy.
Um, Obama.
Good...
It is a total trolling concern.
And I think it's also weird acting like people don't care about violence in cities or affecting black communities in the United States. I think it is a very important issue, especially in local politics, where criminal problems are really dealt with. But it really is just an effort to change the subject.
It is also the case, and this goes back to our other argument, one of the things Republicans have been able to do is cut budgets, so there are far fewer police officers in every city in the United States. And social workers, and other people who could take a preventive situation. And also, by the way, that's why unemployment is too high; We've created jobs in the private sector, but Republican priorities have cut more than a million jobs in the public sector, and that's police and others. So they've caused that kind of problem by denying cities the resources they could use to try to fix the problem.
Let me finish this point because I want to scare you a little bit: it's going to be a problem that no police can solve, because, you know, once you have that kind of oppression, you know, and that gap is widening, something is bound to go to happen.
I agree with that, but that doesn't mean I don't need a police officer anytime soon, and I totally disagree: Stop-and-Frisk is an abuse of people's rights, but the African Americans I speak to, and that includes those in Congress, they don't want less police, they want better police. But they want more surveillance. It's like Bill said, "Oh, the ambulance came too fast because you were in a white neighborhood; a sad joke with some truth. So denying them resources is the problem, the notion that because some police have misbehaved , they want fewer police officers. I don't know any significant percentage in the African American community ...
They deserve to get out of there. Public housing was a temporary stop, right?
Hahaha
I think it is also important to remember: crime continues to fall. We have had a massive improvement.
Local police budgets are not increasing; They are being shrunk. If you work locally, if you work with police chiefs, and people want the services of the police. Yes, you have to improve them, but in Los Angeles ...

Third Eye Blind and Kelly Clarkson were also on the show. I thought that was the strangest pairing, but I soon realized that is what I have always professed. NO BLACK or WHITE music just GOOD or BAD music ... It's stupid that you like things that aren't like you, and that applies outside of music ... If you're African American, you can have a Jewish friend. Wait, does Lyor have any Israeli mixed with her Jewish earl? (Sure they are paranoid, but so are black people after they have smoked marijuana, jaaaaa, plus the JEW and BLUEprint are the SAME.)
I think ... Two things. Roc-a-fella Records. Um, building the brand and the label. And also, the ... Jay-Z brand. To say: “I have resisted the storm. I am not just a rapper. I'm ... a CEO, I'm an artist, um, I've done it ... I have a vodka company, I have a clothing company ... Um ... I have, uh, 47 employees ... um, um. .. Roc-a-fella Records. And I'm not stopping here. I have an S-Dot Carter shoe coming out, uh ... I'm in, I'm doing the first Showtime special in fifteen years. "Um ... Jay, I don't think Jay is over.

Channi ne ta khanne diyan galiyan vi shaaniya
Mundeya a bach ke rahi
It's big pimpin ', wasting Gs
Feel me uh-huh uhh, uh-huh
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah
You know I threw them away, I caught them, I love them, I left them
Divorce it and divide your dollars
Not for nothing, it never happens; I'll be forever mackin '
Watch them now, big pimpin 'on B-L-A-D
Wow, my bad, that's "my stage"
The hoes begin to point, they say, "There it goes!"
And if you lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
But when the shit heats up, the Glock starts to explode like ozone
Blow with the damn Jigga Man, fool!
We're big pimpin 'on B-L-A-D
Everyone wants a ball
We're big pimpin 'on B-L-A-D
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
But still sitting on the blades, drinking that Ray
Take them off the hood, make them look good
With clusters of diamonds I'm freezing
Until I need a what, until I need to beat it, then it's
Just because you have good sex, I'm going to break bread
I give my heart to a woman
I'll be forever macking
Ch ch ch ch
Let's ride
It's just that man Jigga B. Sigel Memphis Bleek
We are doing
Spending cheese we make
We are doing
But I'm still sitting on BLADES hitting on crays
And we, big, big, pimpin 'on LEAVES
Bounce
Bounce
Bounce
I love it, I love it
You all are a little weak, you all have to bounce right now
Beautiful beautiful. Ok, now we are 7 years old.
Let's describe a certain female
(Bitch) you like my style and you smell my cologne
Punch with paper, it will be hit and slip
And not the way you dribble or ball or draw letters
You're a (Bitch), No ma, you're a (Bitch)
Sisters give up the ass, bitches give up the ass
Bitches don't give a shit, they want to see your friend
I love my sisters, I don't love no bitch
I'm from a crack in the wall, a fighter with my back against the wall
I grew up on Lexington Ave, my stockings very high
They had the best meat patties and cocoa bread
I played at the Albee Square Mall around the time I was getting high
Brownsville, where warriors come out to play
Mom is going to pray
Wolves are at work
And we have big weapons like Samoa's
To see a music band
Would you be the savior of the broken?
"Because one day I will leave you
At 10 pounds, when I was born I gave him no pain
I made up the birth when I got here
She knows my purpose was not purpose
He said, "Will you defeat them?
I have my pimp game
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game.
I'm a scammer now
Supposedly knowing that no one paid Jaz Wack's ass
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Goodbye to the game, all the loot, the adrenaline
Your blood boils you on the spot, knowing that the cops could rush
And you in a drop, you are so easy to touch
Except the first and the fifteenth, more or less
And "trust" is a word you rarely hear from us
Maybe you will love me when I fade to black
My father took me to the city
"Because one day I will leave you
No more reasonable doubts, I have proven to be the most deluded MC
Something is wrong with your motor skills because you don't move me
I paint pictures beautifully but niggas is myopic
I kill the track relaxed, almost until it's a sin
I have twenty bags, son, better burn that shit
The bricks that make money fast see me
I am the X as Malcolm
It's like living with your friend who's on crack
In fact, my blacks know my style as hoes in El Dorado
Anything but the main gun I don't trust
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
Great with the nigga huh, from main screech
Triple your cash with your hide and seek shooter
My peeps fucked on the streets keep on guessing
She hit me with a felion, a young kitty
Even holding snowballs and I'm not talking about gloves
Snippet lyrics
-A nigga gets excited about dice games
When I pass your territory with the raised rhythm
Apply to a different school and wait until you qualify
If she confuses you for-
Hi nigga, I was in Oakland, Oakland like Brooklyn
They showed me so much love when I was down there that I had to get hyphy on this
Please have respect like you talk to your mom
As you can see we talk quite often (chatterbox!)
The ROC Boys in the building
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
Wait, I have to keep it real
This is chess, know the difference between the king and the pawn
Yes, what if you change a few words?
I have Creole C.O. bitches for my niggas
You know what the offer is
That's fine with me that's where they made me
I turn my work in the pot so I can spend my bread
Gucci sneaks to keep my outfit together
Can't you say I came from the drug game?
I ran contraband they sponsored
I'm not talking about it, I'm living it
Follow your course and you will understand
Federals like rappers
GIVES. you want to accuse me
When I'm done, I'll be a man
So let the champagne burst
Don't waste your time fighting life
Blue Magic, that's a brand
("JAY-Z won't give me money")
Do they mention the name JAY-Z?
Give me a little more music in the headphones
Let's do this (let's do it right this time)
Got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
I set the trap just to see how he reacted, and now
And I'm sorry miss Rosie Pérez
H-O-V-A
H-O-V-A
Can't you see it's fake, the rap version of T.D. Jakes
I put dollars in mine, ask Columbine
Call me this misogynist
Because you don't understand it doesn't mean it's nice
And I'm going to let karma get to Jaz-O, whoa
I came back before you had a chance to miss me
You are an actor, you are not who you are represented
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob - listen, God, you're a flea
Feel my pain and my agony, nigga
I won't rest until you're on one knee
You want war, so this war is going to be, nigga
Until you're on one knee
Got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
Sit me down now, listen!
Hootie cared, changed my diapers
Valencia's boyfriend Volvo made me move
Jaz made me believe this shit was real
Oh I can't forget my man in Maryland
And your son too, there's nothing I won't do
New rap patrolling the city, follow my teams
Your time is coming: you are a blow away
And if you think I say, innocent if I say?
Everything I feed, everything I read
I have poison in my pen, thank goodness for Lulu
I'm crazy, you ever leave me, I might have to wear a gray gray
Spell for us to stay together
Faceless
Maison Margiela hugging
More than ever my niggas are going to have to stay together, do you feel me?
Already ahead of your end, abroad, hitting Fela, can you feel me?
We we family
All the boys from the favelas around me, do you feel me?
Bismillah, all the gods around me.
Mexicans are not building shit walls around me
Because we are family
I feel like ali
More concerned about Trump than anyone abroad, do you feel me?
We'll put a little '95 there, you know what I say?
We are going to take you back to school, very quickly
We have to adjust the game, put it back where it's supposed to be
What kind of jewelry to copy? You could rule this shit
Manolo Blahnik or Jimmy Choo's for your girl
If you want her on the stand
Did errands for the bosses
Hehehehe, hehehehe
It's history baby
I train in spring in winter, in early December
I'm catching my second wind the second the first wind ends
Push my money (push up), I'm in good shape dunny (woo!)
As a personal trainer, I teach coke to stretch
I wear Roc sweatshirts, all white sneakers
So all you niggas better squat, I drop your rep set
Lyrical exercise, you niggas are not tired right?
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy ...
We don't fight underdeveloped muscles
It doesn't matter how many pounds you bring
What are you betting on, Biggs?
No one is snitchin or anything; you know our team is tight
Sandy pastel face ass nigga (fuck off)
Ayo, Jay, word
Shit, I'm not up front
We keep our pockets completely busted
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches out of air in Aspen
Throwing his ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Beijing
Money burning like noses for the drug dealing apostles, huh?
Because I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with jerk
Tropical leaves where I got some keys
Said we were trash, so fuck the college
I drop the trail, even the acapella
Yes bring it if you think you can hang up
Yes bring it if you think you can hang up
Yes bring it if you think you can hang up
And if not then let me do my thing
Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, Spanish wisdom
High post like Hakeem, I have a lot to leave
Brooklyn to Queens, I have to keep my steam
Money makes the world go round, so I did something to spend
Two point two pounds
Wear it if you think you can hang up
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Lettuce heroes turn deadly
Absence of malice in my palace
His frequent stops at O.T.B. you are feeding me
Steam an intriguing nigga in wrist action with the sparkles
And if not then let me do my thing
Yes go ahead go ahead
Yes go ahead go ahead
Yes go ahead go ahead
I can't stop the flow when all we know is crime
Speak broken English and sell drugs
Get yourself a pair of shorties that shoot a Glock with ease
And let's start dialing G's, never let Bobbito sell you flour
Never sell a tray on my block, you will need the doc
I can't teach you how to hide, I see I have cash
Before the sun came up we were chasing dollars
First it was capsules, now its fish scales and sales weight
Hiding, staying fashionable, putting cash
Once your clientele moves without you, nothing moves
This shit is deeper than the streets, we are working for the government
A magnet to sell small white crack mints
Putting my butt on the line like a trapeze artist
I have to blow, look at the smoke
Psychologists have said it takes 21 days to create or break a habit. On the 22nd, you have found the way.
Brooklyn, let's go hard
Brooklyn, let's go hard, let's go hard (let's go hard)
Brooklyn, let's go hard, let's go hard
Brooklyn, let's go hard, let's go hard
I'm a Brooklyn boy, maybe it will take me a while to get used to
Like oranges, I'm dangerous
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
I father, I Brooklyn-Dodger them
With no intention of returning tomorrow
Now please tell me, what the fuck is harder than this?
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
I have big cash dreams and a sick death wish
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
It's my turn
We chase niggas around their own ball game
Ball game nigga, it's over for you lame
Fuck all of you
They never told you not to fuck with a man's family? Will they fuck with all of you?
If you're playing, nigga what I'm doing can't be defined
Foreign walks, outside, it's like show business (it's my turn)
Hips and thighs, oh, stay focused
I sound like I'm supposed to sound, see you at Clearport
Manhattan continues to pretend, Brooklyn continues to take it! Yes!
Yeahh! Cheers to all my real niggas in Harlem
It's not about municipalities, it's about niggas and bitches
Jigga ... (Jigga), Bigga ... (Bigga)
Ayo, look at the style and the way that the police sweat us (uh-huh)
Shoot your daughter in the calf muscle (mhm)
Most hated
Can't fade away (uh, what?)
But in the con-trilli, pack the MAC-milli
Squeezed over him, he left them paramedics breathing softly over him
Trying to push 700s, they still haven't
Jay-Z, Big 'Smalls, nigga shit your drawers
(Jigga) Jay-Z
My Bed-Stuy flow is malicious, delicious
Since the 62s, Gemstars, my mother's dishes (uh)
No more sir good guy twist your shit
Easy, friend, the Shoney bitch told me
(Brownsville ...) Won't you stop (nigga!)
("Brooklyn ... Brooklyn ... Brooklyn ...")
Nigga please, like short sleeves I carry arms (um!)
Gutter and I had two points
2 for $ 5 hits, blue tops (uh-huh)
If Fay had twins, she would probably have two Pacs (uh!)
Crystal forever, play the crib in bad weather (uh!)
Mafia. keep cannons on them Marc Buchanans (uh!)
Usually four five, the shell slowly sinks
I'm warning you (Hah, what the fuck?)
(Where are you from?) Brooklyn going to everyone
(Flatbush ...) You don't stop
(Where are you from?) Brooklyn going to everyone
(Clinton Hill ...) Won't you stop (nigga!)
Representing BK to the fullest
Better stop playing with me
I don't need a radio to do my thing
Your SoundScan is falling
You better sell them now
Now I realize that puff paper is not enough
And I know you don't know, but G4 is not cheap
And B she has to mount G3 (no less)
They scream from the peanut gallery
I kill shit until I catch Will Smith
So I'm running Spielberg down (yeah)
Or read about them later, nigga
How does it feel to be an enemy?
I'm in power in a Maybach with the missing towers
I'm considered one of the best because I screw up the worst shit
If he escapes to the street, I will not sleep
I'm disgusting, until one of your peeps rests
And I promise my mom, I'm just trying to keep the peace
Your SoundScan is falling
You better sell them now
You can bounce with me, bounce with me, ge-gi-gi-gi-gi-gi
Ya-yah-yah, ya-ya-yah-yeah bounce off me, bounce off me
Can I hit in the morning without giving you half of my dough?
And worse yet, if I was bankrupt, would you love me?
If I couldn't get you finer things like all diamond rings
If it couldn't flow futuristically, would you?
Do you need a baller to buy and destroy the mall?
Brag, tell your friends what I bought you
To these bitches of all my niggas
To these niggas from all my bitches
Who has no love for blacks without dubbing?
Who does not love hoes, do not receive dough
To these niggas from all my bitches
Now you can bounce with me, uhh
How we will move on your bus pass
Pick it up, I leave it every time it shows up, huh?
I let you meet mom and introduce you to dad
My - Coochie remains in a Gucci name
Who does not love hoes, do not receive dough
Can i get a woop woop
To these bitches of all my niggas
Uhh!
Gi-gi-gi-gi can you bounce on me, bounce on me
If not Boo, you know what, I still fucked you up
Who does not love hoes, do not receive dough
To these niggas from all my bitches
To these bitches of all my niggas
Who has no love for blacks without dubbing?
Wit with me wit with me bounce wit with me, bounce wit with me
Maybe I'll come back 96
Bounce with me with me with me
On the right side, can you bounce with me?
Jigga's death, would you keep rolling?
If we couldn't see the sun rise off the coast of Thailand
Girl, if this is so, I
A kind of despair
You prefer to call me William
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
Long live Las Vegas, see you later at the garbage tables
See you where a G up starts
My team and I commit atrocities as if we had immunity
You guessed it, manifest it
Recruited lieutenants with ridiculous dreams of getting cream
You're playing the games, I'm seeing the thing through
I can follow? I wrote ... Can I continue?
{Laughing}
Does everyone have saying "How is it still so good?"
Sorry Lance I'm just trying to move my dates forward
You should let him out of the cage, if not, fuck him
It's a tug, in my heart, but this time a break is needed
Niggas can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood, everyone is lucky
But I will put a couple of green dollars, I will clean you
No Pulp Fiction, Colt 4-5th and
Black youth blaspheming, bang for me, no religion
Are you all blacks finished?
Don't even hate those who hate me, I got Pac on
And black pistols, stack yours
Can I live for all my chicks?
But they can't lock me up, because my tool is the truth
Yes, I sold drugs to live, that's a fact
My mind has been through hell, my neighborhood is the center of crime
And all I see is a life cycle that repeats
Hello to you fags, that's my block to burn
I know heads get pissed off and I knew it all
One thing that's screwed up is the bad drug that I can't pump
Mix it with the raw, bubble it, copy faster
What do you want black? What do you want black?
Trying to win with Timbs construction myself
Check check
I'm making short-term goals when the weather folds
Just save the skins and put ice on the gold
Cold with enough bail money to free a big Willie
Spree shopping, police in threes
Deuce's fever is fully charged, ah yeah
50 Gs for the trash shooter, niggas can't fade me
I'm leaning on any nigga who steps in
I'm in the south picking up the best game
Screaming through the sunroof, money is not a thang
Going down for life, it's true, you better learn
I have big hoes in expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What do you not know?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, because you can't touch the hustle
Drinking Remy on the rocks, my crew has something to do
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
In my charge reading screaming
Thief, as long as I breathe
Baby one day you will be a star
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have time
Can i kick it (If you can!)
Too many women give these niggas too many opportunities
Rocked too many rhymes, breastfed too many nines
I don't follow any guide because so many niggas travel on mine
Ha, what the fuck
Can i kick it (If you can!)
Without all eight, right, maybe you could test my weight, right
Feeling sarcastic, "Look at him, still sleeping"
You're never ready, petty minds forever stay petty
(Without a doubt, without a doubt)
Well it's definitely the bomb! But you know I want to tell you something, I know you've had a lot of trouble with the law
Good
It's called reasonable doubt
Her name is Mary J. Blige.
(What I'm ready)
I'm making short-term goals when the weather folds
Deuce's fever is fully charged, ah yeah
I am one of the best players who did it.
Maria!
(Jay Z baby)
Baby one day you will be a star
Last seen out of the state where I drop my slingshot
I did extensive with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
(Why wouldn't you?)
(I tried to get a walnut and he got a walnut and what)
Le Tigre, Pa, you are too anxious
All we blacks have is sports and entertainment, until even
Thief, as long as I breathe
Can't hit the way a player eats
I'm pulling this time
(Let's take them to the top, let's take them to the top)
But until then lately, am I the one who is crazy?
(We are in Harlem now, we are going to the Bronx in em)
If you know the song, sing
In this dance
(They love that, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. Mary J Blige)
It's okay. We could be at 8, we closed, we closed. Alright, I got you Mommy, let's slow down once)
Ohh, uuuuuuahyeah, uuuuuuooooooh
(Jay-Z, ha ha, Meli'sa Morgan)
My name is like an oath
Now everyone can swear to Jay
And the only thing worse than getting old is not getting old
And I hope you shine
Seen many wrinkles and enough memories to last two lives
To give you a piece of my mind
watch this
If you skate at night towards the light, then trust something
Love the way you behave and beg
I came back with six bags fighting
I can't really hit the hustle (ha)
For this fake black rap business, you know liars
Some of them aren't even rapping for chips
Like a rap star in front of the club
(Cause I can't hit the hustle, the hustle)
We are about to change this game here
I'm left without fear
I'm pulling this time
Moan, turn those screams into screams as we focus as a varsity team
I came back with six bags fighting
I don't want romance, I just want the chance
In this rap business with fake niggas, you know liars
These types of rap can flip, but some don't even rap for chips
What part of the game is this?
It started with four jacks, it ended with Gold Ac's
On the weight of me through you, fuck you
But that's my cash, I understand you hurry
Oh oh oh oh
Lustin 'for creamin' - bitches with big butts
When I'm locked up begging you for porn movies
Sneak in, help a nigga pass the time
Tell everyone; 'Pac left him forever
And give you my love and cry with you
Until I was there to touch the sky
You and I are busy, throwing your dick on the ground
See us, kissing the tongue, I was really with it
Imagine paying for the pussy when the cock is free
Hi, where are my niggas? Tell these hoes
Before paying; I masturbate, word to Moses
Visions of you sitting there sweaty and wet
Because that's the way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have time
Me, all of you niggas having lunch, hitting the clock
Drinking Remy on the rocks, my crew has something to do
However, it is a pity what you are not: who?
My dad knew exactly what he did when he did me
I have the US Open, Jigga advantage
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh?
All we blacks have is sports and entertainment, until even
Ha, man, you know man, I'm just dealing with that money
Uhh, I talk about jewelry and I spit diamonds: all cherry
Dreams of caviar and silk, my voice is linen
I have the Gray Poupon, you have been warned
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath while I
You know the black and white porcelain in the brain cabinet
No you know that's a laid back man
(It's not hotter than that baby)
The star player, the golden bar cape
It can be a fork and can trigger its roots
You know the world can see how false you are, bruh
How can you see the difference between you and me?
'Round friends who kill their friends
Memories can sneak down my cheek
Ready for it, take a deep breath, fill the void
I'm ready for earth, ready for the truth
In my dreams, in my dreams (Ugh)
Do you think he wanted teachers with his teachers?
Ready for it, take a deep breath, fill the void
Still itching for tears, they try to see you
Hoping I can touch what I see
East side nigga with your feet up
Rap locked for three summers, poker faces with aces under
Hitting shit, almost a crime, get Cochran
The same goes for the lame hoes, cocaine rapper
Delegate this, men only give facelifts
Odorless and tasteless, the cause of death has no trace
I know you want to see me lost
Team Roc sweatshirt and ice water
You all niggas are local but that goes without saying
Raised in the rapture, my torture flows
Well-known men at home, all my friends tolerate sin
Put a part through your dome like the Omen, foamin '
* Niggas * is cartoon, fully developed image styles
No * motherfuckers * I hope I fail, and I have to provoke the frail
Geah, there you have it
(Sexy, sexy) I know they missed the bounce
Where are my hustlers, where are my reinforcements?
I need the space to say what I want, now alone
Back it up like a U-Haul truck
He and the Phar-real boy make beautiful music
Ma, are you crazy? Just go
(What do you want me to do?)
Haha! Sexy sexy ha ha! Sexy sexy
Haha!
Let's go to my hotel, because this is not going well
Either that BBC shit or it's probably tailor-made
Haha! (Your boy is back, uh-huh, uh, uh)
Sigel-Sigel in the house! Uh-huh, sick bastard (yeah)
Every time you see Jiggaman, I'm shooting in dubbing
In the Yamaha platinum, I got the engine firing
Sigel: Desert Eagle, dawg, who else but me?
Roc Airs, Roc-Wears, Scarves and White T-shirts
Hit the Roscoe until dawn; Also, I stay silly
Club shit or drug shit, I blow shit, I got shit
Get an ounce, get a forest, everyone shine
I still bust, more or less, still bloated, BITCH!
Spray directly into your brain; by the way, this is Hov
Sigel locks Philly, Brooklyn is me
To do it again! (Uh huh)
I have no time to lose (check it out)
You're gay Nigga, Jay straight like Indian hair
And kill the holmes ice grill
We left the stage to the left, we jumped in his Lexus
.. I can suggest that it is
Many long-legged girls in short dresses
Go dance, go grind one
Quick question: why are you here?
My office hours from 9 to 5, why don't you call me there?
There are so many hoes here
I understand you have problems but I really don't care
.. go find something to do
You need to be easy, ahh
Heh, what you need to do is ...
Stop spitting in my face and go talk to them hoes here
But I reach and bury niggas sixty feet deep
I'm a thief like you, I took like you
COME AND PICK ME UP!
{* the bell rings *} COME AND GET ME! Ka-ka-ka-COME AND RECEIVE ME! ..
I heard over the clock, Bentley's hardtop
I remember a year ago I almost lost this job
The quiet killer behavior of them college cats
How are they going to hit me, take off my jewelry?
Well, today I have news for all the fools, hey ...
COME AND PICK ME UP...
I made them relate to your fight, I told them about your hustle
I was hoping to hear, "Jay, if it wasn't for you ..."
Got shots to hit, come on and get me nigga
I have to protect what is mine
I keep a bump on my ankle, one on my hip
Got shots to hit, come on and get me nigga
I have shots to give, COME AND HAVE ME ...
No, part of this, come get me black
I have shots to give, COME AND HAVE ME ...
Location: Marcy, Brooklyn
He likes the style and the profile, I think he wants to make fun
He likes the way I walk, he sees my money talking
I see your hunger pains, I know your blood boils
He wants to run with me, I know this boy will be loyal
I see myself in his eyes, I moved from Levi's
In game and add a couple of dollar signs to my name
And chasing crackheads across the block for my pay
Time to climb (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Time to go upstairs (lift my chest and booty)
Haha, I like your style (Nah, I like your style)
Here's a you ', A G? I travel with you for free
I want long-term riches and bitches
(Bass?) Yes, the only way to explode
Then you play your cards, then he through the deal, I understand
Time to go upstairs (lift my chest and booty)
Time to climb (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Time to go upstairs (lift my chest and booty)
Uh-huh uh yeah, gi-gi-geyeah
All the game tighter now
Moving one brick a week
Matching with the crocodile shirt, softer than my next door neighbors
These young niggas think I fell out of the loop
Time to change (what?), No more seconds in line
Time to change (what?), No more seconds in line
Yeah you're done (uhh), you risked your life (uhh)
Oh God, don't let it control you all
Any nigga trying to hurt Jay, I feel sorry for you
Give it a year, you'll be sitting in a million or two
I'm done (I went up), I risked your life (uhh)
Time to change (change), no more seconds in line
Yes, you're done, risk your life
The next week two O's left
Leaving your mouth sideways like some novice niggas
What you niggas say nuttin
Reporting to my live niggas like me WHAT
We could stack dough up to the sky
Do you think you get some dough for my community chest?
Blaow blaow two to your chest
Ya cheap niggas like Baltic Ave
I wanna borrow from the bank, nigga what you think
The money from the trip to Peru flew in six coins
Taj Mahal shoots money with orange chips
Long Dick Money All In Bitch Money
Been OG for so long
Where I need a turtle neck to balance my check
And a couple of isotoners to rock my rings
Flip twice, rip that crew and then I'll drop my thang
Jay-Z, Rock Jockey, check it out:
Because all that matters is money
When the beast screams "kill me"
It gets worse, if you don't mind
For my sick thoughts like a nurse
I'm leaving boys and men
The best observe
Used to having a lot
So mass - I blow a lot
I was plotting and plotting mainly
Dreaming alive, but look what he got me ...
Always keep a smile when you want me to frown
They found no weapons, just a drawing of herbs
It's a new day, hit KD
Uncle said I will never sell a million records
about 6 minutes, you'll see me again
Look at me, these niggas tried to shit on me
Make them fear me is my only job
Look at me, these niggas tried to shit on me
Look at me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to erase me from their history
Don't care who you are
Makes the whole city warm like fiddy shots at idiots
Show him I have more and then take the shit he has, Biatch!
My big stack, free hands and a six; vivid packed
For each of you, you can all eat this chrome
There's that futuristic shit, bitch
These cats never touched anything, they will never touch anything
And there is nothing that changes that, dead or alive
Any bad feeling that harbors all of you can blame the environment
She said to me: "Fight in your other life, never renew your story"
Shit from '89, Hawaiian Sophie
GS he fucks Yukon GMC trucks
Slugs ease pain in the brain when bullies squeeze
It's murder
Introduction Salsa motherfucker crank this shit
Thoughts of hating sober and intoxicated minds are taking over
Thoughts that this sport will feed you
Freeze my kneecap, can you believe that?
The rappers broke down trying to keep up with me
You know this nigga: Jay-Z, Shawn Carter
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
So sick of niggas
I'm here to tell blacks that all is not well
One day you're crossing on your 7
'About to start bitchin', right?
And now they are not sane and they are not playing, that is evident
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm looking for dead presidents to represent me (Whose ...)
Presidents to represent me (get money!)
At the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
Factions on the other side would love to kill me
I saw your life slip, this is a minor setback
Murder is difficult to digest, it is a slow process
I had brushes nearby, not to mention
Partner, I'm still spending '88 money, what?
Presidents to represent me (get money!)
All sneaky thieves and player haters can shine
But until then, I keep the brilliant cut diamonds shining
I will tell you half the story; the rest you fill
I spend Japanese yen, I attend big events
"Insufficient dollars make sense, as you ride in the bank
I'm out for the presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm looking for dead presidents to represent me (whose ...)
Mic-macheted your flow
Pay 580 per hit, better think I have 1160 to show
Naked without your gun, we take everything you brought
Presidential dead, politics as always: BLAOW!
Presidents dead to represent me (whose ...)
Presidents dead to represent me (whose ...)
I'm out for the presidents to represent me (get money!)

Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Once the neon light hits the Top Dawg logo
Look at my wrists hanging
Look at me, friends hang out
You know my name, baby, it's not strange
So awkward when I park it
If you try to fuck, baby, do your thang
So chill out, grab your bitch 'cause life's too short
Pocket full of dubbing
Baby here's my number
Baby I'm a gamer, go hit me
Sometimes i did the same
Abusing my resentful power
I found myself screaming in the hotel room
Lucifer was everywhere
Until I found my safe haven
Making me realize what my base was
In the dead homies
Turn this shit on! Sounwave turn this shit black
To Pimp a Butterfly, another classic CD
My diligence just pretends to write your compliment
Nigga, we'll be fine
I admit that you're looking at me because of the pay cut
What Mac-11 even explodes on bass?
Boys and girls, I think I went crazy
Nigga, when our pride was low
Hey? We'll be fine
I don't think about it, I deposit every zero
If I have it, then you know you have it, baby, I can reach you
My rights, my mistakes; I write until I'm right with God
Looking at the world like, "Where are we going?"
But we will be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Dark nights in my prayers
I found myself screaming in the hotel room
So I went to look for answers
I suggest you stay in the house at night
No, I am not Wesley Snipes.
It's been that way since first grade
Strong behavior was getting paid
Thirteen was ready to shoot
I get four shots like a weirdo, oh he knows
You want meat with your boy
LAPD can't stop us
Rockets shoot down helicopters
Pop shots yeah we kill niggas
In the real black
Comes with a [?] For grilling niggas
Trying to bother me so I have to think twice
And when I go I [?] Your white carpet stained

Do not judge! Do not judge me! Now my house has a peak in the valley
Do not judge me! Won't you tell a friend? You are going to see
Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
Ayy, do you know who you're talking to?
Glide like fallen curtains
Or I kill them with diamonds
Or hold on like fifteen hundred
Make you kill the best
I saw it all, I did it all, I felt more pain
Everything I say is from an angel.
Ask for a piece of me, you took it from me
Laughing at the bank like "A-ha!"
Huh, he does (that's how God feels)
Flex on swole like "A-ha!"
(This is how God feels)
Huh, he does (that's how God feels)
This is how God feels
Ah! Ah!
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Where was the influence you are talking about?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached it
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Internal cleaning
No you're not shit you say you love them
I know you don't mean it
You were desert, where were your antennas again?
Where was your presence?
You are not friend
Where were your antennas?
Oh oh oh ohh ohh ohh
They say if you're scared go to church
I'm going to hit the gas with you
Now baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
You looked me in the eye about four or five times
Roses are red, violets are blue
I remember what you said too, you said
I usually don't do this
Lucy don't worry
Lucy just wants your trust and loyalty
Lucy go get it, Lucy is not shy, Lucy in front
I'm going to hit the gas with you
Because I love you)

Smoking, drinking that potion, you can see me deviating
Go DJ, because that's my DJ Dave

I better think I'm going to shoot until all of you disappear
Now you know I'm going, harder than most
I'm in that shit shit, take your bitch, save your ho
And I don't give a shit, if I hit, while she explodes
As much as a referee blows a whistle
Super glue grip, I never slip
She likes "Damn, how do you do that?"
Oh yes i am what people need
Go to DJ, because that's me, because that's me, because that's my
Fuck a gun, let niggas feel the K, man
Thinking of you, face in the bathroom
You wanna witness the liveliest nigga out there
So come visit me, you have to pay the entrance
I have the streets in a frenzy, guys on the streets, they praise me
Don't try to crawl, I have semis and I think they'll be emptied
Mixing the juice with the Remy made me feel so damn drunk
Go DJ, because that's my DJ Dave
This is your season, baby
Trapped within your desire to shoot stray bullets
I should ask a choir, "What do you need?
Sing a song that makes me have faith?
But I know I'm used to just a couple looking for trouble
All I see are strobe lights, blinding me in retrospect
You had finally made the decision to hold me against my will
I can never tell the difference and rate a cop on the bill
I heard them speak: "He's probably young, but I know he's depressed
You don't care, you know we'll never respect
You hired me as a victim, I silently wait for a change
An adult candy, I lost it, I feel like there's nothing to lose
"This city m.A.A.d that I run, my nigga"
Uh, warriors and Conans
Seen a fair-skinned black with a brain burst
Joey packed all nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine
With the sliding door, what happens?
Picking up the damn bomb
That's what mom said when we were eating that free lunch
You killed my cousin in '94, fuck the truce
When we're in traffic and it's tragic, that shit ain't no threat
You move backwards if you suggest you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a helicopter and have a speed dial doctor I guess
It seems that the whole city is against me
"Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Wake up your punk ass!
How do we do it
In fact, I was fired because all my friends inspired me
I was making adjustments the next weekend we parted
I made an alliance that promised to see you bleed
Cluck heads up and down the block and shit
Lark, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
Loc yeah that's great
A couple of passes on the hood lately
Crew, I'm going to kill, the street life I long for
With a basketball and some Now & Laters to eat
And it's safe to say that our next generation may be able to sleep
And the price on your head, tithes are probably going to projects
Compton, USA USA Turned me into an angel in angel powder what
The saga continues
(?)
A new day, we have to get ahead of schedule
Ghetto fox in the headlines, I leave them
Multiple, most love it
I tried to play like the paramedics were coming
It is a new day
Why (?)
Brings for new life
Oho, you ended up fucking baby
Is the S.W.A.T team as aggressive as a mental problem? make extreme coolant red on top of my gun
New hundred spoke
New tray six
New 2pac
As a new day begins, the saga continues
The moral is to do everything possible not to collide with the best of him.
New hundred spoke
New tray six
LOL
These motha muckas plot all kinds of shit behind your back
And I drank a whole gallon of laxatives by accident just to shit on you, it's been
But now I'm here, GQ, man of the year
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Sorry for my residence
As we go
But now we have a big whip, parked on the block
We'll be fine
I admit that you're looking at me because of the pay cut
Schemin ', and let me tell you about my life
Tell the other gangsters silence for the record
We got hurt before
When our pride was low
We'll be fine
I don't think about it, I deposit every zero
Digging in my pocket, there's not a profit big enough to feed you
I don't talk about it, I know about it, every day I do sequels
I don't talk about it, about it, every day I see
Come back and chat, I catch your back for all of you
God
Turn off the engine and then accelerate in a Wraith
How come I can long?
Snort on what I want
Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God
At the end of the Park section
Until your son jumps into your arms
The only time I go to bed in a cabin is when I sleep in it.
I do bench press with this rap material, I have it closed as handcuffs
I threw away the key
To define crack laws
They don't obey, they're not nice, they're just fine
Just inspiration: something you never had
I take out the rocket and take you off like a scab
Nine or 10 labels like what I was hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
But the money was closing my door, I couldn't open it
Money on the passenger side, now who are you shooting with?
I hope you have nine lives, it's not Nas or Jigga
Screaming, "Fuck the world" with a capital F
So keep your shit on par if you represent the West
So where do I go now?
I am the bishop, I am the pastor, I am the god MC
I've been hungry, I think a nigger needs three stomachs
Each line is made to measure, hella paid, count that money, in various ways
Okay, I squeeze the juice out of a rapper and just crush this track
People like "What the hell happened and where's Wayne?"
Got it in the lock like a Low Jack
You better go back, you better crawl where you come from
Like a kind of bottle, get a hole, where you swallow food
Get a model, I bet she swallows, who? Me
On your side son of a bitch, son of a bitch on the side, ride a son of a bitch, die a son of a bitch
Open a nearby store as a retail location
Bitch, that's no lie, tell the truth
K Dizzle, the Big Sizzle, turns rhythms into stoves, burns
Dig, I like it, love it a lot
Where are you going we should be growing up now
It's just a bed for me
So if my letters don't reach you, I hope these letters are synchronized
Where we go? Why are we slowing down?
Now dead to me, missing and forgotten, I'm out of place
Where we go? Why are we slowing down?
Or follow vanity because that means I'm following evil
We all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Wouldn't you know how to act or act?
It is only part of life and if your vision is impaired you will probably lose everything tonight.
I matched my money
Land of scandalous, every corner has a burning candle
Each stop sign has a hollow point
Tell your boyfriend to do it like this
So it's fair for your boy to talk shit, disgusting
Tell them we relax if your boyfriend harasses you
West Coast's New Best Kept Secret
Chronic smoke coming out of my throat haha
Shit, ay, ay, heh-heh, fuck it, I'm going in
In a Porsche Box, stashbox, I got a new Glock
I'm running into your house, then I ask, "Where's the money, boy?"
You picked a bad time to be home today, stupid
I'm ruthless, I'm Eazy-E, I'm Snoop, shit
Guess who is back? Fresh new fitted, turned
We will have your best rapper send
Your records turn us on and wax you, ha
We are the classics of the west coast, you better pay tribute
You want trouble The kings of the shootings
Yes Yes Yes
They play with the word gangster until some turn to lead
Until the ambulance comes pressing on the chest
All gone, only me and my niggas left
And if all of you were built for war
And when I say hard body, friend, not in a physical
Either you were born with him or real niggas around real kids
You are not living it because you put it in sentences
And you're not giving it if it's ten percent, it has to be one hundred
Spray your coupe and smoke on it like Chris Tucker
We lift something from the trunk that has a support foot
Either you crawl now or you lie down
Think about it, I'll just give you a minute
You can see the fire burning like my Lamborghini tires
Wear them for a minute, sell them next week
That is a good profit, you are not thinking about logic
Teach you niggas a lesson or two
We batman and robin
Gone in my fast car
Surround the block twice
What do we tell them? I love you
I only know they cost 3,000
Motherfucker, I'm dancing
No son of a bitch I'm getting stuck on them
But I act like a donkey
When you see them what you say to them (Hello, enemy, Hello, enemy)
Carry the whole city on my back
And can be cared for every day without an internal maid
Bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism.
Then it becomes crack and then it invests between us blacks just one message
Just a Tec for soo-woop deviation, izuzu then blap blap blap
Say it like I'm nigga, say it like I'm home boy
Pac is rapping, Gregory playing, people sing, bells ring
He witnessed poverty
Bathe me with the will that never dried up
I tell you to put aside your worries and friendly doubts
She has been miserable, she has been living in prison
Tell me you're ready to change
Say just in time
Running junkie, I'm out of your passion
Fool of her for trying to play my vanity
And this is high risk. I risk everything for a couple of snakes.
I never felt more alive than dying
Say just in time
I heard you spend all your time baby (Ohhhhhh)
At least one black has a baby penny (At least one black has it)
Baby, my vice, she made me drive without headlights (is that true?)
She said I have a plan, I have a plan for you
Tell me what you want me to change, hell I'm still drinking the same
Strolling through the city, big taxi
I'm in London, please don't ask me
I don't know when I will return to Cali
I said I'm going through town, big cab
Out in London don't ask me
For the valley girls or the hoochie girls
I don't know, I don't like it if your wife is his dog
They all put three fingers in the air
Stand up for something or die in the morning
Visions of Martin Luther looking at me
Adult men should never bite their tongues
This is physical and mental, I won't sweeten it
I don't want a plastic nation, I'm afraid like a Haitian
I mean the shit is that Huey Newton is getting stupid
Raise your hands by HiiiPoWeR
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Just call the fuck HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
We've been depressed for a long time but it's okay, na-na-na
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So you can see exactly where the government shot me
Terrifying, so fucking terrifying
Try to stay above water, that's why we avoid the marina
All real smokers understand me H.O.C
All real smokers understand me H.O.C
Shit that makes you bend down to cover the shit
I drop jewels as my nuts fell out of my underpants
I go to study sessions and I feel like a nerd
I did not know my eyes cause low genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
I bet you think this sucks I wrote
(No) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
Look, today everyone thinks they are great bosses
That's the kind of lines that I'm talking about
(No) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
Probably in your neighborhood, fucking your street, nigga
He said "Don't hit him hard because he will hurt you"
I bet you think this sucks I wrote
I remember you were in conflict
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Or maybe because A-1 was my foundation
A war based on apartheid and discrimination.
Doesn't mean I can't respect you like a black man
If I can fuck her in front of all these passengers
And a Comptown equipped
Back on this bitch, on the back of that bitch
I call bitch bitch, hoe, hoe, woman, woman
I never did anything but break the ground on the asphalt
As a child I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
Evil as 80 worshiped in a pool of fire with demons holding hands
The king of diamonds with diamonds, I never ask
She is calling the task force, I killed him, someone handcuffed him
When your niggas has been poor? You will never jump in my lane
You play like a bad sport, your feet on the board
Hol 'up (Hol' up), hol 'up (Hol' up)
They'll probably think I'm Osama
Bir dolar için kaza kuklalığı, biliyorum onunla tanışmak için can atıyorsun
Bekle
Birisi
Ayağa Kalksın
Bu işi böyle yaptığın sürece zenci, kaybetmek ihtimal bile değil

Hello, oh kızı stüdyodan in ali

Eğer onu bütün bu yolcular karşısında becerebilseydim
Beni muhtemelen Osama Bin Ladin sanarlardı
Every time I call, it goes to voicemail
I've been A-1 from day one, you niggas boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
I came in this game, you got your fangs in this game
You weren't wearing a chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
50 nigga salute, at Compton Zoo, with the extras
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
14 years later going hard, like we used to do with dead homies
It is nothing new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one do you rule?
Your house boy, your block where you are from, boo boo
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rapping
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory is gone from
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop who can push the button
"K. Period, what's wrong? I heard they opened Pandora's box"
I've been A-1 from day one, niggas boo boo-
Abusing my resentful power
The resentment that turned into a deep depression.
But that didn't stop the survivors' guilt
But while my loved ones were fighting a continuous war
I was entering a new one
Can't you see me, we crawl down the alley
I'm in, celebrities in love
This is another word, your mom
She made long hairs for them, but doesn't wear high heels
I mean, she has the shadows
It's like me, it's like Jay Z, Pac and Biggie
That like me, it's like rappers don't know where I'm from
My eyes are wide open like deer in front of
I come from Compton, I spit straight heart
Tiny Toon Adventures, Dennis the Menace
I'm a threat, I spit, I break the world of Guinness
When I'm flowing, you never know, I need another word
LeBron, Wade, no, they can't be defeats.
I stay in the shade, I'm in the dark, even though I'm hot
I come from Compton, (?)
-number of a rap artist
Damn I'm the hardest
Tell them lies or tell them the facts
But you hate it, cause I'm your favorite girl
Run in your class while you do your standards
Frustration (seeing you dance)
How many drinks would it take you to go with me?
You look good we came to the party
Passionate (it's what I'm making you feel)
But I don't want to waste my time
You look good we came to the party
This is the olympiad
It's your time to own it, I see it in you baby
Throw them aside, let me slide up
Or waste your time, or waste your time
Baby it's alright baby it's alright yeah
Ok oh yes
I don't want to waste time, oh no
Than? More power to you if you decide you could be ___ tonight
The parasites in my stomach keep me feeling, you guys
"20 at the pump 6", Marcelo dirty called me Dumbo
20 years ago I can't forget
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
A piece of crack I wanted, I knew I was smoking
He asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
I said "beat it up"
I said I didn't have it and closed the door.
He's looking at me, his eyes followed me without a laser
I never understood someone begging for goods
Asking for brochures, taking it if they could
Staring at me longer until he finally asked
Tell me; How much does a dollar cost?
So i'll tell you like i said to the last bum
I'm picturing Denzel but looking at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad emotion, your trick is mediocre
Tears of a clown, I guess I'm not all that I should be
Dave
Have your gun with you, cause the niggas will try you
Uh
Tell the truth, bitch, nobody, and that's real
I'm the only one who fucks me
Me, so put your album back on the shelf
A nigga tried to taste my gangsta
I pulled out a gun and helped her
Also, the boy married to rap, old cats need to renew your vows
Sit down, practice your verbs and nouns
Cause I'm about to make progress on my words
I am the best you heard today, without a doubt
Since then, oh yes, intelligence
10.9.8
Have you ever been under hypnosis, I mean literally
Can you imagine spending a couple of minutes without knowing what happened?
You got up in the morning, you showered
Call some bitches, want them done in an hour
You tried to maneuver all the way to the call box
But what I love the most is how you put it
Wait!
You know what that means, I'm done with you
Goodbye!
With a dove-skin bitch lying next to me
Wow, I'm amazed how you niggas talk about being married to the game, they didn't make a vow.
Shoot your whip, fuck your tire, leave your car flat
I don't write it
Off the top like a psychic
So supernatural K..dot come see me on Sci-Fi
So please build your catalog before you remove your cattle
This saddle on a red horse that is a red Porsche
Or don't listen to me and meet the criminal henchmen
Welcome to the wild side
If I quit this season, I'm still the best, funk
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
Bitch, sit down (Hol 'up, hol' up, lil 'bitch)
Be humble (Hol 'up, hol' up)
Sit down (Hol 'up, hol' up, lil ', hol' up, lil 'bitch)
Be humble (Lil 'bitch, hol' up, bitch)

Ayy, this shit is too crazy, ayy, don't surprise me, ayy
Sit down (Hol 'up, hol' up, hol 'up, hol' up)
Come here, this is for you, go up
When you look at me, tell me what you see.
(I love myself)
They want to say that it is a war outside, bomb in the street
And a bottle full of grease and a model in the scheme, huh
I lower these cold faces, I publish pe-f-fo-fum
The sky could fall, the wind could cry now
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the police head
Baby what about you, come on
How many times does the city make promises to me?
(I love myself) Huh (my heart fell apart) one, two, three
I went to war last night (night, night, night, night)
And it is evident that I am moving at a meteorite speed
Finna meets a building, puts my body ...
(Argument off stage)
We could save that shit, this for the children, brother
Not really, answer the question: how many niggas did we lose brother?
In dead friends Charlie P you know that brother
It's command, right, it's command
And I say this because I love you niggas man
I love all my niggas brother
All my niggas listen, listen to this:
I retraced my steps about what they never taught me
History books overlook the word and hide it
Black stars can come and catch me
Watchin 'TV (Watchin' TV)
I love myself
Raise your head and keep moving? (Keep moving?)
Everyone lacks confidence
How many times was my potential anonymous?
How many times does the city make promises to me?
So I promise this, huh?
Uh, dream of the peace of reality
I love myself
I love myself
Down, down the deep valley (Down, down the deep valley)
It's a real Compton thing right now
You know what I'm talking?
Last night I went to war with an automatic weapon
I'm gonna do it until I get it right, war last night
I could, I could never take the initiative, I could never shake and weave
The negative is letting them annihilate me
Money on the roof, put my body on the street
Seen enough, make everyone scream "I love myself"
I lost my head
Appetite for the feeling that I can hardly describe
I could be your lawyer
Kendrick Lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a Spartan
Marching on Rosecrans in Compton
I'm on point as point
The way he separated the soldiers, then brought the shooters together
My unborn son and grandson will live in royalty
Well I've had this world since I was born
Feel the hunger of the good boy
The Crips became strong, the Pirus became stronger.
And if you say no, you can offend me
He was alone for so long
He prolonged his entire career, but now he is here.
The definition of what's great
Uh, I used to want to be like Michael Jordan
I thought I had come to the NBA and made a fortune.
501s, Louis Letterman jacket
You know that Compton ghetto shit
But I'm from '87, with a thousand dimes
Fucking all my high school teachers
And I don't like it if the ass is thin
Friends say I'm the real one
Bitch, I do this!
The definition of what's great
Boy I thought you knew this
Uh, then give me fifty foot champion
I drop a record and then raise the crime rate
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch I do this
Hating his girlfriend just so he can fuck
I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
Confuse them as a Rubix cube when I roll
When I leave you, you ain't got no paper or a ***, nigga
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Fedora on top, the black Abraham Lincoln
Missionary Kama Sutra, fuck shit on top
I'm still serving, on my tip TIP
The definition of what's great
Nigga's booty wavy, the chauffeur got me to share the car
So when it comes to stunting, bitch I do
We will be shining blue and brown and we have that Gucci gold
Hoes choose, blacks hate, we don't stumble, we keep our balance
Boy I thought you knew this
Boy I thought you knew this
Chuck deuces, then drop one, drop music and I won
The tables change, let's say you earn rights to be the God MC
Boy I thought you knew this
I'm K. Dot, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, I said Philly
Where are my gangstas? Where are my dime?
9 out of 10 times half of you will die in this fight
I feel like Muhammad Ali at his best
I'm trying to see a better way, I still feel hate
They just kick the door like they have permission
I wish I was sitting in the booth doing the chorus or something like that
Without assumptions, I know I'm nice.
That nigga, Colon Powell
I'm a mindless thug with book intelligence
We gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession.
Exclamation, put it in quotes
The rapper of the rapper, the MC of the MC
I said cheese
Better pray this helicopter jams like a radio solo, man
Police radio signals say an 187 lands on your corner
Ask me what I have accomplished
If you don't give a shit, put your hands up
This is the hardest shit you've ever heard of LA so far
And I'm so far from being a download, but I'll never reject them
Until the day I hit you with a gun until everyone piss you off
Enough, I'm listening to the comments
Critics call me conscious
Proof ... that ignorance is happiness
You are one hundred percent behind me
Like the speaker who spoke when they didn't speak
I'm afraid of you but I will fight with you
You introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers, children and babies drive me crazy, I wonder
One of my biggest fears is waking up at 4 in the morning and hearing that you met one of my colleagues.
You son of a bitch and I wish you never existed
Let me continue this letter saying I don't like you
And all I say is a prayer, "So help me Lord!"
Of knowing that you are eternal
From the land fatal assassins
Sooner or later, I'm tired and tired and my gray hair is not in my favor
Please take it personal
So don't say i don't sympathize
But you can hardly get curious, I'm dead
But I take it from someone and you can probably find me where the wolves parade
Signed and sealed by the living
Cousins in primary, relatives in secondary
That said, each of its rivals
They'll kill you if you kill me, it turns deep black
So if you ask what am i doing
I'm not a gangster, I'm not a murderer, I'm just your average Joe (you know that)
I was walking from the centenary
Well aware that they had blue on their hats
I have never seen so many weapons in my life
I was paranoid like a demon in the night, but I needed revenge
You are my brother as a fraternity, and that's just to remind you. "
I'm not a gangster, I'm not a murderer, I'm just your average Joe (come on)
So there you have it
A real gangster is dead or in jail
So many motherfuckers want to knock me down
Uh, when you look at me, tell me, what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the police head
(I love myself)
Raise your head and keep moving (keep moving)
Or let paranoia haunt you? (It follows you)
Peace to the fashion police, I carry my heart
In my sleeve, let the track begin
How many times was my potential anonymous?
And a bottle full of lean and a model in an outline
Blowing steam on the face of the beast
The strong in me, I still smile
(I love myself)
(I love myself)
(Fi-fie-fo-fum, fi-fie-fo-fum)
(My heart undone, my heart undone)
(The world is a ghetto with big weapons and posters)
I love myself
Glory to the feeling of the invisible saint
Seen enough, make everyone scream, "I love myself!"
I must have misread what the good book said
Ay, ay, keep me, it's a jungle inside
Give me again until the well runs dry
In a woman, is it in money or in humanity?
Where are you front to back
Maybe you're on a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day
He is the immaculate verbal killer.
No challenger can compete, their children and weak, harmful
Give me a hundred grams, for each master of ceremonies I knelt
"Oh, do you have the juice?" I squeeze you without juice
Been the truth since "Snoop and Tha Pound" was fucking by Ruthless
Lyrical cyclops, paper laser and fraudulent friends.
I swear to God, can you song lyrics in a jar?
Explosive, cinematic, smoking
Like the barrel of this TEC pointed at your neck
At the Avalon exchange meeting, "What a fool was he?"
You are a piece of false and useless verses browse this
Thinking of living without the past and the present
Exactly 10 minutes, letting my mind explore
What if B.I.G. it was never big
But would there be more Bloods sets than Crips?
Los Angeles, Orange County, the valley and back to the bay
Imagine if Mike Concepción walked alone
Or would he have lost his life on the streets?
What if the Rick Highway was never a kingpin
These rappers ass upside down
Imagine seeing your mother cry, tears of happiness
Knowing her son safe, and she won't lose him for this madness
She has a fat ass with an amazing mind
Now isn't that true love?
I tell him to kill Cupid and give love to my crew
Tell them you couldn't bury with two cups
Dad needs his courage or faces eternal extortion
I wrap around the orbit in my Darth Vader
Black Ski Mask Green Leaf Body Bag Pouring Liquor
Both 40 oz poured is like the golden sidewalk in the bird
That's the state's mind, rap niggas meet your destiny
Dave Chapelle these niggas are half baked
I won't let any MC go to waste
No I can't lose, comfortable on top
I'm below zero, I put your career in freeze
Delete it as an unwanted movie scene
You are afraid, right?
Fucking failure!
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I'm not proud to admit it
Recover
Biting my style, you're positive for salmonella poison
Shit doesn't change until you get up and wash your ass, nigga
"Damn, what am I supposed to do when I watch lame walking?
One more fool waving with a flashy doll
It's a recession, so why the fuck is he in King of Diamonds?
When I see them, put the diets on the floor
Do you remember stealing from the rich and giving it back to the poor?
Shit doesn't change until you get up and wash your ass, nigga
He was a meter and a half, stunned and confused
You can get your boy out of the neighborhood
He took his money from the show, hid it in the mozey wozey
Advise you to buy or copy the worst
I don't make sense since the Rodney King riots
The four pounds decorate your city
Until the reaper comes looking for me, follow me now
Beneath my sheets, lifeless, thinking of death
In addition to a nice chest so your body can sleep
The shit from Hub City is me
Love
You are my friend, I tell you
Pray that the holy water does not dry out
As I look around
So many motherfuckers want to knock me down
But an enemy never drowns me
(Said I have to get up, life is more than suicide)
Everyone lacks confidence, everyone lacks confidence
(Said I have to get up, life is more than suicide)
The sky could fall, the wind could cry now
The strong in me, I still smile
Down, down the deep valley (down, down the deep valley)
Fi-fie-fo-fum (fi-fie-fo-fum) (I love myself)
(I love myself)
But you can do whatever you want when you want, I don't care
I went to war last night
I must have misread what the good book said
Give me again until the well runs dry (i)
I pray that my dick gets bigger like the Eiffel Tower
Start that Maserati and - vroom-vroom! - I'm running
And I beg you niggas are hating, shooters go after Judas
All my life I want money and power
Damn, I got bitches, damn, I got bitches
Damn, I got bitches: wife, girlfriend and lover
I have 25 lighters in my dresser, sir
And I run to ho with a cane
Kill everything from the pussy to a fucking hit-boy punch
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, I win, then the ball to your defeat
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, my city, mobbin 'on the street, screaming:
I respect my mind or I die from the lead rain
I pray that my dick gets bigger like the Eiffel Tower
All my life I want money and power
Kendrick has a dream
Sit still and close your eyes (smoke it)
I used to write rhymes all day and all night
While playing PlayStation, my pencil erased lines
You killed the nigger, I stole a bible, is that a sin?
Give me rings, give me chains, mane
A mansion with marble floors and security codes.
Give me fame and fortune, Trump and me on golf courses
And that's love
When love comes calling, don't look back
Now everyone smokes, because this is the celebration
The pattern shots I take take away my pain
Now I'm just trying to catch the cream
So I without one is like I'm dating
Rapper athlete, killing these niggas, they scream in agony
Half of these niggas ain't half of me
Great depression, I don't know much, all I know are study sessions and how to lift my bars
(?) Usher
Either way I'm stuck on materialistic
Home of the stray bullet that kills the innocent
(Holla) - x4
Dog, I'm on chrome, I gotta be safe in this shit
I don't ride a skateboard, I roll with some grinders
I was a drug dealer, but now I'm a wild spitter
I can't help it, the hood flows through my blood
This gangbang shit must be considered a drug
Everybody doing it now, I see them rap niggas
Every day is a lesson, well they kick me out, the shit made me guess
Two weeks before that, he couldn't pay the rent because he lost his job.
A week earlier he had loaded bullets into that chrome.
Two weeks before that I shot bullets at them and he left
A month before I cursed my mother and then closed the door
Six months before he hit my wife, she hit the floor
The hollow tips missed me and then they hit that kid
I faced, jumped, and looked out the window.
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why
Because I need you
But it's all to ease the pain of this
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow
I feel like you're there
It was the next morning
My shit is so sweet, caramel flavored, no you're not
Skeletons in my closet
And no you can't get up
Halloween, better come with me, I'm sweet
I don't want that to happen, because if so, I could start rapping
Kim Kardashian, Wiz did that ass on
Made of matter, this is the perfect part to talk about Lakers.
All disrespectful, all counterfeiters
And we will keep going
Obama, vote now, house boy, have change
Two fired the stagecoach
Lipstick is suitable to make you demon for more
So seven cars start honking
She gives everything to her dad, but she doesn't know her father.
Look, one block from Lueders Park, I saw the Camino parked
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Luxury girls on Long Beach Boulevard
And it's quite simple, your castle is about to be destroyed
Discover the mannequins that look like lures
What is between his thighs that he would compromise, to his surprise?
She took the ultimatum around the alley and gave him
Although it was connected like a pair of jumping cables
Pointing out all these flashy cars
I saw the park the way
No more K. Dot, my mother had called me Kendrick
Weighing my options, pick up a Bible or a leash?
I never killed a man, I never sold crack
All I did was try to keep my city on the map
I look the devil in the eye and say, "Hell no"
Well i want the world tell me how long does that take
Whatever my pop said, I'm sure I'd listen
You said you made dirt, but I can't dig
Oh-no-oh-oh
And if you are not trying to win, why try?
Now you can hit or give me five
I will be an artist tutor, leave them without an audience
They'll party, I'll steal from their audience
Walking as it is fosse or present from Deus to a terra, mano, você não é merda nenhuma
Você sequer compra pra mim uma roupa pro dia quatro de julho
Eu precise daquela Brazilian Wavy of 28 polegadas, you are jumping
Você é um negro "sem marca", everyone knows disso
My other hand is tied, you are tied
What the hell is he hitting?
We are 10,000 feet above Compton in a private jet, and Kendrick Lamar explains to me what happened to him yesterday when he disappeared. We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided tour, guided by the G-funk-star synthesizer in his neighborhood, where he still lives more or less, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old school High School, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, AWOL left. All day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records who originally signed him, could locate him. Kendrick was gone.
I asked him if this meant things were okay between him and Drake. The pause. "Very cool." Shrugs "And I mean, it would be nice if we weren't."
A month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not great. After Drake's new album was released, he gave a couple of interviews in which he sounded hurt by the "Control" thing: "You can't say that and then see me and say, 'Yeah, man, what's up?' - pretending nothing ever happened. " Apparently in response, during the encryption of the BET Hip-Hop Awards, a few weeks later, Kendrick went free-style: nothing has been the same since they left "Control" / and tucked a sensitive rapper into their clothing. Pijama.
When Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before rolling his eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he is not the hermit type, on the edge of the Nitrio Desert, who sees the vision. He knows what this sounds like.
Much of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his devastated world without parting with him at trial, about somehow gaining control over the chaos in his home: some of his uncles were Crips, and his father allegedly He was a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Chicago. Compton, and for her neighborhood's distorted commitment to teen pride. It is an ethos that extends to your crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can sometimes seem a bit monastic. Kendrick does not smoke weed or drink alcohol. In my time with him, I never saw anyone roll even a jay's thinnest spider leg, nor did I see Kendrick as much as looking at the many, many girls around him. "When I ask OGs why there is so much division in the streets, nobody really knows," he says. "But do you know one thing everyone always mentions? A woman."
Twenty minutes later, Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith, basically Suge Knight of TDE, asked me if I had had a fun day. I said yes and that I was surprised by his discipline. "You guys seem so calm," I said.
Every part of me says forward
I have my hopes again, oh no, not again
And we'll scream without rules, without rules
Look around me and you will see the scene, who to blame?
See my generation is not ashamed, I play the game
How I see it, this is in the future, this is nothing you're used to
Out of your position of power, my frontal collision of the army
Every time I walk in, nothing is more convincing
Every part of me says forward
This is me changing my face because I can be alone and die alone as long as I have pride
The truth will set you free and for me that is the only reason, capisce?
I have my hopes again, oh no, not again
It feels
I don't want you monkeys motherfuckers
Sitting on my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's going on?
When you received the yams ... (What are yams?)
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
And if I have a brown nose for some gold
Now I run the game, I got the whole world talking
When you received the yams ... (What are yams?)
Bill Clinton manipulated with wishes
Twenty-four seven, three sixty-five days multiplied by two
King Kunta, everyone wants to cut off his legs
Bitch, where were you when I was walking?
They're all suicidal, they don't even need my help
Stuck a flag in my city, everyone yells "Compton!"

Life is not shit, but a fat vagina
Now I run the game, I got the whole world talking
King Kunta, lossless black man, oh yeah
Bitch, where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, I got the whole world talking

Young and I are ruthless, twenty-one with twenty-one pistols, shots that are looted from Pac, lyrical cyclops
Lazer-in 'em on paper and fraudulent friends, bitch, you're a bitch in disguise and bitches get ten

Die to him, die to him, live your life, live it well
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
Looking for a victim of an AK-47 of 100 rounds each, each, each
Sometimes I have to

Be different, do different things
Well, it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you're a fucking liar
See the soul of an artist out of control
Now my love life is dying, the family has surgeries
Mom said, "According to everything ...
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
I miss your call four times this afternoon for lack of better words
I had a penny every time you missed better words
I wish a nigga would do it (ah!)
Damn, bitch, hoe, huh
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
Let me tell you when it all started
Many comparisons of Biggie, we all knew them
And his brother designed, put together the music.
Saying that Game was his partner, then I gave him my tape
But he still didn't have a home, Hootie did? In Myself
But we got over it, we heard the beat, we wrote a rap
They signed it months later, Warner Brothers
What the fuck The next thing you know is that we meet Lift Me Up
It was a success
When i hear it
Jump on him for sure, it was to crush
The shit turned sour after Jay-Z left, but they didn't care
See I was young, fast, hot dollah had the streets closed
And all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2Eleven too
That part that I'm going to leave out
Bishop won that game, then had a fight with X.O
We're the last real niggas alive, that's official
The nigga finally told me what he said
That's the only way i know
Wrapped in shit, call me Jeff Goldblum
And California in that idiot shit
Jill Scott on my iPod, while my head rests
That's the only way i know
That's the only way i know how to hold it down
And yes, I know I'm from Compton, Cali
But I don't tie the Chucks or the tan khakis
I'd probably wear them but my cock doesn't fit
Ha ha ha, I like to joke, do you have a sense of humor?
You don't have to ruin your face in front of the children
But my character could never be like them, man
And they respect that, they say I'm a real man
I had to look through a photo album to remind myself
Lying to yourself, about an image
Frankly, I dusted off my shoes with my scarf
The reason they hate is because these motherfuckers aren't me
Look, I give you my life, to mix it in a blender
That's the only way i know
Just let me be me
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
Kendrick Lamar, what are you trying to say?
I just want to be taller than that
Trying to say goodbye to glamorous chains and cars
That means i will be up front
22, like the smallest gun you know
The most determined, but with the smallest funds to show
The negative that you bring, stress, violence
That means I want to be the tallest
Uh
The anonymous bodies on your burner were amazing.
More gangster under the family tree, took them under his wings as KFC
When blacks wake up and become intellectually independent
No federal, state or municipal court will end it.
LOL

All because I'm 21
I am so cool
I'm also bouncing around the club
Cool ziploc

But my floor is marble
On the back of that chrome
See they're all I need
I appear more than I appear when the police explode
You Fruity Pebble, gay with velcro
Mistaking myself for a real bully, this is not a game
Although he's not here yet, motherfuckers still know who's the best
The murderous niggas from Cali don't know how to act and I
By the way you take
It is so and so and so and a
The murderous niggas from Cali don't know how to act and I
Give up, give up, give up, give up, hit
I have a problem, so I'm jumping to your team
Cicada niggas, with their little babies walking with guns
Better step up your game before it's over
Crabby red, fall to the ground, you know he's dead
Bang bang bang bang bang bang
Wash, bang, bang, you know what is good, bang, bang
You are an amateur, they want to call professionally
Like a shadow in the dark, you're a paddle in the boat
I pushed the porch when I was six
Because I go out with my fist raised
The mark of the beast uses your damn barcode
Trapped on the street where it's dark like Harpo
All the niggas tried to take it from me
I had to fight and shit
Are you really trying to attract someone
I'm being myself, my best friend is a BM-dub
I bet I end up on a level with a black belt
Pl-, Plus Q gave me some Kush and some Nuvo
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How strange, my battle scars in general tied me
And it's all because of the horrible
The most unpleasant flows, chlamydia, uh
I'm not afraid to say I need you, oh yeah (Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop)
I write with confidence, my people unite
Bolder lines in rhymes and things
Provoke the blind and bombard demons
The paths that show exactly what it means
From your socks, baby, you're a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders
(Wooh!)
Because I finished the game to the point
I spit the saliva, that's filtering the lava
Graffiti your arm up, you, heebee, jeebee
You treat me, you greet me, you find me with your arms up
Spitting bars to provoke your mind
(Wooh!)
Don't you know baby? (Ooh, woah)
Whenever you need me (When you need me)
When you need me (When you need me)
Just look over your shoulders, honey!

Damn, love or lust
(Another world premiere)
Drinking bubbly, feeling charming, living charming
Just love me
I want to be with you, ayy, I want to be with you
I want to be with you
I know what you need
All the feelings go away, this feeling doesn't dry
This party will not end
If I downplayed my net worth, would you still love me?
Keep it all at a hundred, I don't have you, I don't have anything (Uh, uh)
I want to be with you, ayy, I want to be with you
Just love me, just love me, just love me
I don't want to pressure anyone
Oh by the way, open the door by the way
Your mommy's curves and hips
Remember Gardena, I took the studio camera
Look what you did
I'm like a way out, yeah
I have a ball for my dead friends
You always hold it down
In love and memory, no enemy could separate us.
I love it even if I don't get bigger
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Pushing aliens, flying cars
Bring Derek back, Stunna Deuce
Sunday school wasn't great let's get the bitches on
When I'm in these rhythms
Chad, I promise I'll be back
I am saying
I'm laughing, I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
(Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo
Ba-Ba, bow-bow)
All we have is us
My resume is real enough for two millennia.
I'm hanging on the fence again
It's been a bad bitch before the cash came
I'm set, a hundred carats in my name
You can take care of it when I leave it out
There is no other love like the one I know
I said I'm angry and I'm excited (fired, fire)
All I want is, all I want is
10-4, no side change
Someone you would slide by?
Someone you would die for?
10-4, no side change
You act suspiciously, you don't ride
God knows I'm dying baby
Right after my admission to the game, I asked him what his name was.
Music Award [?] For all nominees
They promised me to win, he promised to leave
Too much heat to simmer could also overheat
Am I asking too much? Let me put my head inside
Well i never expected
Watch yourself a comedy, fuck off, then roll up some weed
Or maybe some kicks and make you ...
Wake up in the morning, thinking about money, kick your feet
Wake up in the morning, thinking about money, kick your feet
Have a good fuck or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang out with friends, get close to your baby mom
Dive into the shower, put on your makeup, tie the fabric
Beats racing like a junkie, I just need you to love me
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl, respect the cat
If it's okay, she said, "It's okay"
I wake up in the morning, my head turns since last night
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
I dropped my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Time passes, things change
Lust turns to fear
I need some water, something came over me
Am I asking too much? Let me put my head inside
You thought I was cute at my point as a widow P
I have that lightness giving them deary that they do what they do
But the driver shot you
This is spoken wisdom while traveling a poem and a mission
Under the biscuits we go to distance

A wall of bullets coming from AK, AR, "Ayy, you duck!"
They say the governor collects all our taxes except
This city m.A.A.d that I run, my nigga
Every time I'm on the street, I hear ...
In fact, I was fired because all my friends inspired me
Projects broke down, gang cartels are dumped
I was directly retouching, the next weekend we reached the equilibrium point
I made allegiance that promised to see you bleed
Kendrick aka "Compton Human Sacrifice"
G-yes, cocaine, grass
So loc, take a strap because yes, it's so real, yes
Would you say that my intelligence is now a great relief?
Constantly drinking and driving
Niggas always acting callous and shit
Once
And life is a bitch, don't hit women so I bit her
Fucking my prestige, until I live with the blues
Through the barbed wire
Tryna escapes the stereotype of the world
See a scar on his eye, boyfriend brutality
Celebrate the same day that she passes
We are, we are (true)
Through, through barbs (cables)
Living on your dreams like Christina uh-Milian
By making good decisions, I gained an independent entrepreneurial mind
And if you say they can't live comfortably
Flows sicker than cancer in Manchester
I make it hot
I go from Compton to Watts to the suburbs of ian-ghettos
Battle Tryna
You can not see me
I i
Does anyone want to see God?
I have to pay, I have to get laid
Bite the sound, I just came and burned
Blewell jeans, Moby Dick seams
Shit, I'm back to the front
Where are you safe
And catch it all like a referee
And never question my shit again
And I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
I don't know why your bitch wants to fuck me
This is HiiiPower, since Eddie Bauer I have been popular
Skating on them, why do you hate them? You should learn from them
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
Man, the game chose me, what should I do?
Out there on my bumper like a city cop
Fuck niggas, crazy pussies
But I know I can tell you about your girl, friend
But I make that pussy pay me
And I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
I have three for these hoes, Wayne told me that ...
I remember stumbling, walking the set
Your choice is over, I guess she keeps going, yeah we do it wrong
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I'm too much for these niggas
Head in the clouds but my vision is fine
Just like I'm Kanye, they think I'm crazy
How can I manage faith and fame?
If you sometimes see that I'm angry
When everything goes wrong, you see something wrong
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Within two bars, you already said I'm hot
They taste my fruits of work
To go against me you must be more than professional
You have to go harder like an erection without protection
And I'll be fucking all these bars
Take this and take that from the machine
Got this money, no caffeine
Apple's software freaked out for the next 10 years. I am Fred Krueger.
Leave them dead inside the sewers
Oh lord please don't let them misunderstand me
Look, I'm acting like an idiot, but I'm not Jack
You can't make that butt feel or flip-flop
I'm too gutta nigga that
With 45 thugs 45 shugs
Chase your butt up, pull your roof
I see you big dogs, all I hear is wow
I could only ...
... snatch your bitch if she has a big appetite
Like a Chevy in quicksand
Pendleton Black Cap (West, West, West)
Isn't it charming how threats became attraction?
Pivotin 'rappers, finish your fraction while you write blue magic
We've been waiting for you
I know everything
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know the universe works mentally
I know the benefits of shit are not for me
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the drug addicts
Just give it to the kids, no gossip about how it was distributed
I know what I know and I know I will never forget
I met a little boy who looked like my features
Run a number about the man and woman who crossed it
Sun shining down on your bills accounts, exhausted
He looked at me and said "Kendrick, you know my language
If you resist, I'll back up fast, go on a flight or two
From the feeling that I can hardly describe, where do you live?
Tell me something, it made me lose my mind, ah!
Jump, jump, jump, jump
From the feeling that I can hardly describe, where do you live?
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your lawyer
Uh, me and my niggas tryin 'to get it, ya bish (Ya bish)
Hit the lick house: tell me, are you ready, bishop? (Ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhyming, ya bish (Ya bish)
Everyone will respect the shooter
Nerd
A dollar could fuck your head bitch
Hit that new E-40 after school (long after school)
You know, "Big Ballin 'With My Homies" (My friends)
Gangs sign out the window, ya bish (Ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (A pot of gold)
Through canals and alleys, just to say
Nerd
A dollar could fuck your head bitch
This is how I feel, no
Do you love one of you bucket-head hoes? No way!
Take to the streets and then crack the code? No way!
Do you apply the brakes when you are on patrol? No way!
Imagine Rock up on them projects
Bakin 'YOLA whippin soda'
Pots with cocaine residues
Every day I am in a hurry
What else can a bully do?
If they do, tell the truth
But everything is okay
On the streets with a heater under my overalls
Choose your poison, tell me what are you doing
Through canals and alleys, just to say
K’s Mom: Look, he is as tall as hell. Shit, and he's not even tripping over those damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back!
Then came Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" ("Let Burn")
Park the car, then we start rhyming, ya bish (ya bish)
A dollar could make that lane change
This is how I feel, no
Hit that new E-40 after school (long after school)
Another victim in the war, ya bish (ya bish)
Gangs sign out the window, ya bish (ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold)
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
Money Trees is the perfect place for shade
This is how I feel
Do you love one of you bucket-head hoes? No way!
Take to the streets and then crack the code? No way!
But for now I guess this bag will work (this bag will work)
They told money the root of all evil (that's all evil)
He hugged the devil the moment he saw them
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
Money Trees is the perfect place for shade
Uh, my niggas and I tryna get it, ya bish (ya bish)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my brothers (tell my brothers)
And I've been in a rush all day
This way, that way
Money Trees is the perfect place for shade
And this is how I feel, no, no
This is how I feel, no
A dollar can turn into a million and we are all rich
Back to reality, poor, ya bish (ya bish)
Said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (ya bish)
Gangs sign out the window, ya bish (ya bish)
Choose your poison, tell me what are you doing
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I've been in a rush all day
This is how I feel, no, no
Be the last to get this dough? No way!
Do you apply the brakes when you are on patrol? No way!
Even if you're doing crime ya bish (ya bish)
Dreams of living life like rappers do (like rappers do)
And I've been in a rush all day
A dollar could say fuck the niggas you came with
This is how I feel, no, no
Make sure you don't bring your man to my concert
Nigga, I'm Compton
They often remember the old days, Hardaway / Alonzo
Artist you are a novice that I am recording in a spaceship
Closed-minded niggas get clotheslines I guess
I have the keys to his pad like I'm about to write and shit
Nigga, I'm Compton
I am convinced that we are already in hell, passes the forceful demon
If you walk with a mac van, throw a bus up your ass!
Fuck you and fuck you fucking niggas
It's not a countdown, fuck with us
And your bitch be my promo
They are like oh no, wait, he's about to take all the cake
Nigga we made men and cavemen, living in the stone age
Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ...
I feel like
Crashing a little shawty
Lowering my window and hitting the road
No it's not friday
Thinking that my music doesn't stick like some nunchucks
I'm not bragging or bragging, I'm not a person, I'm a dragon
I'm so far from life that I can OD
So to speak, niggas that ain't close at hand
I'm not cool, but change how I feel about myself today
Fuck the government, the law, the jails
Fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitchin
Whether you screw me or not
Fuck, keeping it real
I'm a K-dot to keep it
Some people say I'm rude, but I don't care if she says he or they
Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ... Today ...
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Let these words be your Earth and your moon, consume each message
Won't you look to your left and right? Be sure to ask your friends
Is your smile permanent? Is it your vote for life?
Would you know where the sermon is if it died on the next line?
Would you judge me a drug addict or would you see me as K. Lamar?
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
Even if you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, how much are you dependent?
Revenge on your mind when mentioned
You want to love like Nelson, you want to be like Nelson
You wanna walk in their shoes, but your peace rarely
That's not like Nelson: I want you to love me like Nelson
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
As I lead this army, I make room for mistakes and depression.
"I remember you were in conflict
But that didn't stop the survivor's guilt
Just because you were wearing a different gang color than mine
If I respect you, we unify and prevent the enemy from killing us
The ground will open up and swallow the evil
Right
They could eat the rich, you know what I mean?
Do you look like someone rich?
I changed everything, I realized my destiny.
I became a millionaire, I made millions for many people
I made millions for these film companies
And through your different ways of success
And it was happening to me for a reason
So no problem, you know
Shit, I like to think that every opportunity I've had, threatened with resistance, has met resistance
And I want to leave everything "
There's nothing but confusion, so I wanted to ask you
I think America thinks we were just playing
And it's going to play a little more, but
The only hope we have left is music and vibrations
Describing my world, he says:
While consuming your environment
One thing he noticed is how much the world avoids it
And discover a way to improve it for your own benefits
Already surrounded by this crazy city
That institutionalizes it
When they get trapped inside these walls, certain ideas take root, like
The result?
They are one and the same "
Get my career right
How should i
So don't blame me if I hurry like I'm broke
Because all my life I've been bankrupt
Bubble Kush in the trunk, helicopters in the front seat
So far from life, that bitch I could OD
Die twice and return the same black
I am a great king behind the black tint
I'm in the studio
Get my career right
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
First-class steering wheel and arrest
And my records show, not even in the Guinness
Open to criticism, there really is no room for criticism
Cooking the flow
How should i
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
No matter the cost
They say, "Who the fuck with you if you're the MC god?"
I don't have to study law
All day all night
Cooking the flow
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
The cliff of the unknown
I said my name is Kendrick, Lamar
Fuck a stage name
The only thing I can identify with in this business
Weighing my options, pick up a bible or strap
I'm trying to find some dreams, everyone wants me to follow the trends
Why do we kill our brothers, why do we hurt our mothers?
We should stick together because we are all we have
We all have
The bullet penetrated his leg, bone of the femur
Niggas would rather steal than think of a fair plan
But every time I turn around you take it away from me
We hate each other, we hurt ourselves
That's why today, blacks are going to love each other
Still don't praise him, thoughtless black pride
My people don't want me
Martin and Malcolm those guys paved the way
Shit needs to stop today
To be better people, think about it
But now we run away from our brothers who support them.
Let's leave this shit behind you
Actually, envy and hate must stop
My people don't want me
We hate each other, we hurt ourselves
We all have a man
We all have
We just raise our guns like championship cigars
Mom hold the porch drinking OE from a straw
I remember it all, the early days of Compton
If they shoot you in the bleeding heart
Oh
Before the warm temperature warms up
I am the future of the new west for you visitors
They don't care about other niggas
I'm talking in particular
I'm igloo cold with it
And you don't look like a zombie and I don't see cells
I sink niggas blackships, he won't sail
And I had that state of mind since twelve
I threw away the key, my awesomeness is on, she loves my air conditioner
I push the coupe like at high speed
I'm Mike Jordan at his best, Issac Hayes.
Study my trade, ignorant, I do it without a pen and notebook
About crack, but never about it
I'm real with this rap, I'm just talking about the facts
So put your whole package together, I'm going to take them off the map
Easy shit, hard to do, easy for me and hard for you
Try to study some cool things, then maybe you will be where I am
Your composition is not great, your mediocre mixtapes
Recycle the same appointments, the flow is not changing
You've feared your whole life, there's no TV show
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
Uhh, and that scares me
Nigga tells me that I'm a Peruvian drug trafficker
This is crack co-caine, I'm Kurt Co-bain
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my crack.
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
You pussies are not shit but a venereal disease
Z is in K.Dot? Uh-uh better wake up
Cuddle up like Big Worm when I fall
That's Pookie in New Jack headlong with a Cyclops
I guess I'm the blood sacrifice of the party
So, my bad if I put you in rehab
Aw buddy, you're about to fuck OD brother
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all the time
For you to wear it, it was early in the morning '
Of beauty, of wit, of colors in the tone of her skin.
I love your smile, you can do it without style
It's the beauty in it, but when the makeup happens
I don't see it, all I see is a blur
I say beautiful and how long it took
For you to wear it, it was early in the morning '
Of the beauty, the intensity of the colors in the tone of my skin.
I feel like it's not enough
It was that he had a black eye. To be continued ... 11
You don't have to get drunk to have fun
I love the way you put it in your eyes
You don't have to get drunk to have fun
Without makeup today, without makeup today
I said I'm a damn monster
Everything appeared, then it appeared in Tracy Veronica's jaw
I could trip over a pride of lions
Or your living debt, all soft as a giant pet
My flow wet the ceiling, I spat until I felt my breath
Who is sinking my damn chest? She fucking better
Where I will dissect them like a fucking frog straight
Why did you destroy my incredible incredible flow with irreputable?
Bitch I've been doing before niggas screw it up
Pay cash when your chain is lost
The goal flowed, I'm somewhere blown up
Cheerin 'for the raging beats
I was learning by gaining knowledge
Proposition, getting money
Drop a nigga, rush a nigga
Bada Bing for the ding a ling
Feed the weak that is Wing Stop
Hi, look at our patent, huh?
You all ain't nice niggas, you're alright
Do you study my craft, ignorant? I can do it without a pen and a notebook
It's inspiration, something they have never had
If my pockets are something you're trying to grab, look, I pull out a rocket and peel you off, old news
Do we really fuck with President Carter?
My answer is that I can't get away from the bosses
Money in front of me, I couldn't open the door
I am so far ahead of my time. I got people within 5 years pressing rewind
Where are the true artists? If it is not a good image you draw, do not bring it to the architect
Your composition is not great, your mixtape is mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, you're not
Don't compare me to them, it's like Jaws vs. Nemo
A gorilla to a chimpanzee, Jordan vs. Kukoc
Before committing suicide
Walk on them, circle the block
Guns drawn, explosion! You son of a bitch, bang!
Chief physician, knee pads
The curtains close on that Maybach
Street attended, for having been living on minimum wages
I wrap rappers on stretchers
I love breakfast, lunch and dinner
Making numbers like an accountant
You wonder like a knife, how much money am I counting
Verbal mass destruction, do you want it? Then call me
Yeah right. This son of a bitch.
I hear you.
Man, Malcolm, shut your mouth. Let's go in here, get the money, get out. Simple like that.
What the fuck, man?
People can be killed. Yes. Here we go. Yes. Yes. Than? Than? Than? Than? Throw it up. Uh, we're about to murder this shit. Kill this. I murder that. Yes. Assassinate that and this. Ha, we're killing this bitch. We are killing this bitch. We are killing it. Fuck it. Stand up, niggas. He is a unemployed son of a bitch. They haven't seen any shit like this.
I have these cops running towards me because I hit the back of the damn police car. It was not my fault. I'm ready to kick it with K-Dot and they're cute, man, and these cops sweat me for hitting the ass of the car, damn it. I told them I hit my ass. I don't give a shit if it's a fly.
This is a special award for rap music. This is what brought me to the stage. This led me to travel around the world, support my family and all that. Most importantly, it showed me a true definition of what it was to be an artist.
Weezy was on it, bruddah?
Listen to me?
.38 Special, Grab It, Let It Have You, Where It's Safe, We're Hungry
Where the killers posted on the corner like a letter stamp
I put my hand on the bible
I swear to God if I lie then I'll probably die tomorrow
I'm here, I'm not running even if the Iraqis were behind me
Back against the wall, I'm applauding you quickly
I wonder if you can understand or bear the explosion of my anger
Starving every day, look at my face where the bowl is
Bowl on my face, I walk as my mouth holds it
21 gun salute
Cut them 7 ways, the funeral is held for 6 in 5 days, you know I'm going for
For a hacking of the streets and my odyssey
Because my cousin is a blood
Good boy
City of M.A.A.D
Thinking of the good times before meeting Jay
You were like "no no no", I was like 12 years old
They say hello (ay) .. Hello (ay)
Until I saw the video with the ring in your hand
I just bought the Sasha Fierce CD
She tells me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect
I said "So? I'm only 500 million away, there's still hope!"
And I didn't laugh when you broke your ass on stage
I would have stolen the award just to show that I love you
Now I tell everyone that Nas had killed him in "ether"
See you
They say hello (ay) .. Hello (ay)
I hope you still have a chance
Maybe if I sabotage your man
And push it towards a dancer, hopefully they will close their lips
So this marriage ended with
But if I'm done with Macy Gray, this plan will never work
Make the ruler apologize, you're not ruling the shit
Dick tightly vixens the movie and narrowed squinting eyes
Without a condom, it's a good pussy
Corn bread will break under pressure if caught
Back against the nearest wall, my back came back with back aches, whoa
Your beach is not allowed, I'm teasing your play towels
I move the crowd like Artest and they
It has to be a sin. Hm. so Lord forgive me I'm a sinner
I show fools I'm nasty like tofu I wish a
Motherfucker would hurt your whole career
Last month I was six hours inside the session
Good
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
This is that shit that makes real niggas grab your cock
Two-door regals, El Caminos, and two more.
Trace your ... without the ... coach
Ladies press, I bet your dog is watching, west coast, what's up?
Gangsta, gangsta you don't stop
And you don't, and you don't and you don't
Jay Rock, SchoolBoy, Top Dog Entertainment
Who can blame me
This is the freestyle of the top of the dome.
And you know that Big Boi is my home
And you do it, and you do it, and you do it and you do it
Jumped out of the service station, a homeless man with 100,000
He begged and begged
Tell me how much does a dollar cost?
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
They want to know the question
K.Dot, all stressed
This is a freestyle on top of the dome.
Big Boy city, you know my home
You can't see us, it's TDE
Because you don't deserve it if you don't
Please consider that the best agree
The number one ringmaster
You thought I was taming myself, at the point like a widow's beak
They say the number one ringmaster you better believe
Because you will be disabled
For the best of what I know, you hate it
But I still need you all to change the beat
Because my words always compete with the best
Boy we run rap boy this is Top Dawg
But this is not a strong arm, friend, it's just a freestyle
Out of the brain, boy, you know I'm going wild
From the bottom of the ground from Adidas and Run DMC
Deep cover on incognito tip
They say he writes my bars, forget it
I've been writing for Kendrick for a long time
From a little friend, I said "yes, yes, you"
I said "calm down a bit, brother"
But this is the way I want to instill in you
First let me write down what you're going to say
So he just sat in class
He was looking at me and he said, "Do I have a pass?
Then suddenly it came to me.
Don't stop there because I think [?] "
When the guy comes with a contract
But I said "wait, let me see that"
I said "ok he wants this he wants these points
You are my Lil Partna, how old are you on the scene?
I said it's okay, go on, and suddenly
So I came back and he was still in class
I said TDE, the real Macoy
I can't forget Jay Rock, I can't forget the schoolboy
And so I gathered the entire crew, but from the bottom
Uh, I see everyone wants to play gansta now, huh
You have to respect it
Seeing myself apart from him could plead the fifth amendment
Nigga hard head, all you need is an instant
Let's say you break your gun, but you never touch it
You say your man is dumb, I think he's smoking it, buddy
But you can call me a fly because your boy is crazy
Pussy flies, so all the girls think I'm the shit
I have it to spend, but still I never buy shit from them
Better watch your bitch
Something like a light switch
Be god damn
Possess 76 as a Philadelphian
And the shots start to come
It is real
You see me on the streets man
It's real black
You have to respect it
It is real
Still affiliated
Are you going to live on your knees or die on your feet?
It's fire on the street, fire on my Swisher
I've never seen a crop circle
Can you hear these screams?
Three four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch fucks the prison
God forbid, the friend got wet, so we tried to soak him
In a system destined to disintegrate (Ooh!)
Who did not play like children?
And on another note
Life is a bottleneck, life is a bottleneck
Ready to go, ready to go
I wrote this because I was ordered
For example:
Are you going to beg the fifth or honk your horn?
Do you know what all things have in common?
You know they can't control us
You will leave knowing that you represent something that is greater than all of us
This is me
I am a sinner who will probably sin again
I can feel your energy two planets away
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Look into my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
I can feel the changes
Wear it over my sleeve in a movie
I can admit that it looked like yours
You can see that my city found me
I have my drink, I have my music
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
And don't compromise the feeling we love
The feeling of feeling lower emotions
Rather a seasonal name
I can feel that the new people around me just want to be famous
With all disrespect, let me tell you this
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you do best
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Lord forgive me! Lord forgive me!
Sometimes i need to be alone
I have my drink, I have my music
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I can say I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
When the color blind is hanging with you?
I can admit that it looked like yours
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel that the new people around me just want to be famous
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy two planets away
I have my drink, I have my music
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axes.
The feeling of feeling lower emotions
So put me on stage, for me that's amazing
Sometimes i need to be alone
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
You haven't heard the coast like this in a long time
Three in the air, I can see that you're in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
I'll take your girlfriend and put her on a pedestal
Get out the door and yell he's alive
I say trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
You don't know how much I had to give to come alive
Look into my soul
Look inside your soul and you can discover that it never exists
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life
You don't know what pain is
Another mistake living deep in my heart
I can admit that it looked like yours
Why does every creation of this bother you?
I can feel the changes
You can see that my city found me
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy two planets away
I would share it but today I'm screaming
You're trying to keep it private and you only sign what the radio does
And I'm looking beyond you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axes.
You live in a world, you live behind the mirror
It is much more credible, give me a feasible profit
Instead of a season name, I'll tell people that this is something you can blame
I'm an escape and then I hide every lock
I can feel that the new people around me just want to be famous
So put me on stage, for me that's amazing
To you that's a quick checkup
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I would share it but today I'm screaming
Three in the air, I can see that you're in sync
I am a sinner who will probably sin again
Things that I do not understand
I always knew that life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you are painless for me
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axes.
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Instead of a season name, I'll tell people that this is something you can blame
About yourselves you can stay trapped in a box
I'm going to go out and then hide each lock
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I would share it but today I'm screaming
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch don't kill my vibe
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Trinidad Jame $ in four weeks
You guys keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
You look at my hat and you see thorns there
And when the water resides, you're Bobby Boucher
I am a sinner who will probably sin again
Things that I do not understand
I have my drink, I have my music
Up in the clouds, my husband and I
It's a million dollars, baby, Hilary Swank
I've been on my wave for like 20 years straight
And still be straight (still be straight)
I am the highest, the highest title, number one
Kill my vibe, that's your damn funeral
I ministered this generation by far
I'm the 'best' at Globetrotters because I didn't drop the ball
I would write a 16 to put a black on the big screen
Cardio lap, I was running for my dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here black
Lil 'ole image I don't give a shit about what a nigga has to say
Nigga, you will never be Jay, you will never be Nas, you will never be Snoop or Dre
So many detergent washes
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Bitch I'm at the club with friends tell me what's good
Okay, so what are these niggas doing with the catastrophic K-Dot?
Talk that shit go to the bathroom, walk that shit
Bitch, I'm at the club, friends doing indo
Beyonce, 2 Halle's and 3 Keyshia Cole's
So I say "What's wrong? What's wrong? Nigga, you made it"
So I say "What's wrong? What's wrong? Nigga, you made it"
So I say "What's up? What's up? Nigga, I hate it"
Making my conscience ask me
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the only leader who anticipated brighter mornings.
Really making it possible to swim
Graduated with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
That we were just backing down
Determination, ambition, more dedication and wisdom.
Now watch that black boy fly
Black boy ...
A Buick had passed and hit him when I mowed the lawn.
Compton made you believe that success was not real
Be honest, none of us knew about a record deal
A tall black jumped with Jordans and a white tank top
Black boy flies, watch that black boy fly
Regardless of where you stay, keep your head and keep marching
Like every time I walked to the corner, their weapons exploded
(Black boy flies, watch that black boy fly)
What is it about, is it money or skill?
Maybe it's both and I got large amounts, it's real
Run under cover, my lineage is proven
I'm tied up today, my gun is off my waist today
I'm in the white house doing my best
I merge jazz fusion with trap music
I mix the black soul with some rock and roll
They never locked me up, I'm David Blaine, all your hoes
Oh yeah, let's go there, my DNA is DMT, I'm so weird
My youngest was wilder than nolia
Running this shit with four pairs, son of my bitch, I could demolish
I deport them to their graves, corporations extort them
I'm taking off endorphins, I'm a powerful alien morphine
My glow is quite beautiful, a hundred bills for the doorman
So pay the man for his performance, rest all my clothes
The story of your life here.
Hoochie, coochie, trance pussies
And the casualties around me, don't make me demonstrate
Defer my patience for power and earn royalty payments
The rampage had been my favorite, King Kunta the biggest fucking
(Why am I going easy?)
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the late.
The vision of the King, Black Panther, King Kendrick, everyone salutes the king!
Are you an activist? What are your city's plans?
Are you a king or are you kidding me? Are you a king or do you pose?
Because the king does not cry, the king does not die
KING! KING! KING! KING! KING!
Ready state
HOV, I've been ready
Because I don't have to think with a light bulb on
And that was before
He doesn't wear the same clothes as you
Every time I take off
Pandemonium when I take off
You made my record sales fall short
My answer is that it's not my fault
Blame god
I know patience is virtue
Bulletproof under that black tent, you can't shoot through the shit
I'm being myself
Mom is going to clean it up or fix it
All you need is a little season
Blame god
Uh-uh, fuck that (fuck that)
You have a high tolerance when your age does not exist
So I order someone to bring him Vicodin
And you feel like nobody can relate
Man none of our lives is trapped
Yes, its president is black, she is also black
Two pills and a half weight, nigga, fuck it
When the Nuvo begins to choke his body and I know
She looked at me, then she looked at him
Because we were born in the 80s, that crazy A.D.H.D. "
12 bottles in the case, black, fuck it
Whoa, whoa-whoa
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'mushroom, blow', dro, hoes, whatever you want
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
So after watching your fight for a while
You have lost ... your life. "
Oh please i don't like
I am the best in LA. In Los Angeles
Everything is copastetico. Hip-hop no longer faces Armageddon
OMG I'm the best rapper under 25 you can underline it
Shawn Kemp, Robert Parish, John Salley his entire career on the bench
What it means consecutive championships
Weight on my shoulder, Perry fridge
T Owens with Jeff García throwing the pigskin
Maneuver as Warrick Dunn
I'm having a little fun, have something with me
I'm a star kickin 'niggas from the field and man from the court
Or knock him out at the stadium, hey, wait a minute
You could say ... ay
Just let me dial once
I'd go for a week betting I'd be missed more than a Nolan Ryan pitch
After this you will applaud him
If not, fuck it, I'm having fun
Homie, I'm a blood sport ...
This is what kings do, talk on paper and skate
This is what kings do, throw the family first, it's real
This is what kings do, thinking of flying the [?]
This is what kings do, breaking down plans with speeches
This is what kings do, make sure mom is right yeah
Whether you sell buttons or select cakes
All Pharaohs in Camaros flexin 'S5 (Uhuh)
I, I, I, I, ayo
Ya-yah, ya-yah
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Yes Yes Yes Yes
This is what kings do, throw the family first, it's real
This is what kings do, make sure mom is right yeah
This is how a king moves
Blood on my hands and it looks like candy
That's exactly what it sounds like
Get some ambition, why are you bored?
Blacks like gossip like bitches
Everyone wants a ball, holla on broads in the mall
If he gets up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with all of you
(Counterfeiting industry) I can't fuck with all of you
And I closed it with a kiss (a kiss)
Arrive on time
D.E.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
D.E.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
K-Dot, I'm claustrophobic, don't put me in the box with you niggas
Improve your game
I take 99.9% of your fans
Put a bullet in you, tell a doctor to take it out
Until we load the ammunition and drop the bomb
Torch in hand, yeah, I'm running
Make them like Paul Bunyan, ax on him
I'm talking about golden bullets and black suits
And I'm like spitting cousin, bye
You don't listen to me
I'm just chasing my death
The application of your knowledge is me
For trying to test my patience as nurses
Put your brain in your lady's purses, crazy niggas
Until we load the ammunition and drop the bomb
I tell you I'm one up
It took me too many moons to fuck this new bunch
They call me and tell me I have to crawl before I walk
Like I'm Derrick Rose
I move the crowd like Artest and they
Listen to it, you need label authorization just to turn
Injury your entire career
She calls my dick antidepressant
None of you niggas stressful
Picking popping
Until the fingers twisted
You monkeys never make sense
Cooperate, go home and see your daughters copulate
Tear your ass, then congratulations
K. Dot
... I wonder if there is only one frame
Honey, just take it easy
For you…
Hello, what's up doctor?
You held the gun, she was giving birth
Hear my tears all in my songs
Let my life be lost in this cabin
And I run it (Yeah! Hit!)
That's ironic
This shit makes a nigga just wanna write
And that's a pact that I made in every tribe
I bet I put some new tires on lightning
Living at the bottom of the food chain.
A new name, you want stripes, and you're a similar zebra
I hope that another murder does not make you sleepy like a nun
That's a mistake you can smell it in the air
And all really doomed
That's why I'm opening the door for you back, motherfuckers
I looked in the mirror and realized I had something to prove.
You told me: "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
And I execute it (Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit!)
And I run it (Yeah! Hit!)
Let my life be lost in this cabin
Even with a piss pot
Discounts never equal a check
Drama all in the cut, hit the curtains
Emerging in everyone's corner (Dash for it)
Get a toe tag when you play tag
With a new task (Workgroup)
Everyone wants to know my life
I've been running this shit ever since (I asked)
For a baby to be like you, I wonder what that is worth
Friends, enemies all the same
Yes, I do not have a microphone
Just another player with a lot of play
For the record, he used to make a lot of humps when he was little.
No, this really is a Sounwave song.
So I really don't have to steal anything, all I have to do is kill him
When you press the record button, let the paralytic feel it
Made of stuff where are my niggas?
I'm in one, I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good boy, crazy evil city in my heart
Malcolm X's mental state, if I raise the crime rate
I repeated Kanye's "Touch the Sky"
But I'll look beyond that I'm trying to touch God
In 2010, I try tryball, nigga!
Like shooting jumps in the mall, nigga!
That's an Ab-Soul quote
I guess since you laugh, that's the end goal
Searching for seven continents achieving great things
I'm not tripping, I'm just tipping fo-fo
You'll never know when I'm gone (twice)
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
I don't care and Quik went to the same school
Like a self-made nigga, I don't need a maid, nigga
They can make me so much bigger
I have my back against the wall and a .45, a dog smokes, Chris Tucker
Hoes tell me I have a big ego
To put you on time, it's time to reveal the real thing
And your career is as fragile as Winehouse's.
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
And if I die before waking up, I pray to be in outer space
I have to look, I mean wow
One by one, you must have won
Living in the city of the unknown
I brag her, I do stunts with her
You gotta be an odyssey from heaven and higher
The way she talked dirty she did it, she threw my ass
As a quarterback, Mr. McNabb
She introduced me to her friend Teairra Mari
Well watch Mari sleep a nigga
I came faster than a NASCAR turning back
In the back of my bucket I was not using any mattress
Now we can all be famous cousins
And if I fuck, I swear I won't say anything else
I'm sitting, take it for what it's worth
I'll give you a job, since 106 didn't work
Outside
I promise, just take off your clothes, no one will know
Ciara gave a nigga the goodies they love tonight
Like a Voltron, I couldn't keep my pants on
Saying "this is just one thing"
Remember that time in your house
Remember when Nelly was downstairs
We all have a good time
And if I screw, I swear I won't say anything
I promise, I swear I won't say anything else
Oh ho ho ho ho ho
Ridin 'with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild and reckless is how we live life
Pray we get to twenty one (one, one, one)
Oh we hit twenty one (one, one, one)
Kızlar ve erkekler ile takılıyoruz ve kafamız iyi
İstediğimiz tek şey iyi zaman geçirmek
Dua et ki 21'imize ulaşalım
İstediğimiz tek şey iyi zaman geçirmek
Su şeyi kindar bir şekilde yapmayı öğrenmiş genç adam
Kızlar ve erkekler ile takılıyoruz ve kafamız iyi
In time you will learn that it is about you
But the belligerent children we live with
Twice baby tell me you love me
Cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
Because I know that she is unfaithful
Selfish as I want to be and every time you're under me
Now that's the maximum
Cause I've been drinking too much, thinking too much
We have not kept in touch
Lord forgive my sins
She said I found the root of everything wrong
And every time I'm under you, me too
A highway, an accelerator and tranquility.
Twice baby tell me you love me
Look at all the shit I've been through
Mom, take this damn block off
It never happened, and I go through withdrawals
Ask you if you give me your rent for
K. Dot wrote to me saying that Marcus was killed
Men lie, wo, women
Look at all the shit I've been through
That's the date the day I remove the block
He got up and they put me in those police cars
I was running, chasing dreams to be the best
You had taught me that the same day I won
God's will, say a prayer for me mom
Dante, if I get stressed about removing the block
Who is your protection? GOD
No it's not negligence i just accepted
'Member every night I cried
Men lie, wo, women lie
Pouring halos on enemies, killing insecure niggas
BIG old man, new Pac, OMG he's alive, rapping
Bombs in your intellect
So I'm crazy, yeah, I [?] My fucking crazy
That's not an Escalade, it's a damn armored truck
Could it be [?] In Houston
And I know black helicopters on the roof.
Let's say you want to clean my dirty clothes
I got this jumping like a kangaroo
My life is full of excitement
Sneak (dissin ')
Let Willie Lynch's theory be reversed a million times with ...
You like it i love it
You like it i love it
You like it i love it
(Where's friend Rapsody?
Keep your head up, when did you stop loving your
I need a paradox for the pair of documents they instructed
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose twice
I'm not talking Jay, I'm not talking Bey
Carefree barefoot babies
Teen Gun Toters Who Don't Play Fair, Should I Get Out of the Car?
Fix his forensic glasses would have told him that Kendrick had killed him
And master being the master at dodging your honor
I'm still laughing at the critics talking, I can see them gag
It's the murder hat 'and I'm the captain at the birth of this gangsta rap
Crumpled khaki, crime on the rise in Rosecrans black
I know this is how Compton works
And that's a fact
I must report that we import the narcotics you purchased.
Then he talked about it when the crack hit the speakers, the music business
Perfected by niggas who manifested music to live
So tell the gangster to drop his set
Flying back to my city cause I'll always be on hold
Now we can all celebrate
The harsh realities in which we had our music translated
Who knows where you stay
I make them holla "
Blaze only
Give me that '94 Puff shit, Ali
Mos Def, word for each autopsy
But I really am as rude as Marshall Mathers
Of course it's a contradiction, what the hell do you think life is?
I looked in the mirror and said I can't be like all of you
And the dust and shells come out of that gun
'equivalent crimes by prison sentence'
No one prevents this war
Safe as the edges of each ocean, now let's explore
This is very extra necessary
Reg calls them Jabberjaw, she's going to jump and jog
Just to read my twitter blog
And for you bloggers who say I'm weak
You all don't price shit
Bring the water to a boil and just get a jar or something like that
Let me put on the gloves
If you want to learn to cook in the drug business
Find the most expensive chickens
I recommend that you pay
17.5 no
Drop four thousand
But friend if it is not
However, that's another story
250 grams of coca cola, 150 grams of soft drink
Until it starts to harden, slowing down
Work should come out on top
As soon as the razor arrives at work, you are happy
How ironic ... hmm
You're too professional with that man
Uh, oh, you know what it is
Bell tip, (come on)
Fuck with mine
We live righteously, we don't give a shit about your opinion
Where Eazy was pitching, Dre was pitching 6'4
I'm trying to tell you about
Rollin 'says gangsta rights
A young weapon but not like your young Chris and Neef
But when you see them please be quick
Could you contain them
But there is no way you can stop them
At the same time, I hope the system doesn't block them
From Rosecrans to Central, Compton Centennial
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights, dude, that's Compton's life
Your door in the morning woke you up like roosters
A nightmare on my street, Fred Krueger where I live
Even adolescence will shoot you on that paper
We get + Vapors + like Biz Markie but I'm still used to it
From Rose Crest to downtown, Compton's Anthemia
We come back, that's for my people, it's official
I'm from Hub City, yeah, that Compton court building
Little Caesar for five bucks, mom bought at Food-4-Less
Hood in every corner, stop gas and go crazy
Rest in peace 4 Folded, rest in peace Mausberg
Even though I know it's chaos, my heart will live forever
Where dreams come true
Compton, Compton
(Verse 2)
Taking you back to Y.E.T was just guessing
Pull me just to plant me a ball 8
Fuck it, even though I'm here, I've always been here
Cali Love video, said what I said, yes
Eazy paved the way, Lil Eazy was about to make it ...
Word to the county building forever I do it to ...
(Chorus)
That pussy bewitched me
Walk with these
Do
That pussy bewitched me
I am your neighbor (I am your neighbor)
And I'd like to welcome you to Good Kid, m.A.A.d city (Good Kid, m.A.A.d city)
So grab your cartoons and cereal (and sing)
Sing along to the children, sing along
When we grow up, we go find ourselves a million
Golden Ballroom, AK-47 dancing
Then they make the decision to take the wrong turn
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow like Coltrane, blow like Coltrane, yeah
All the ghetto boys say "that's my car" (Yes, oh)
All the ghetto girls say "that's my car" (Yes, oh)
Couple stole televisions and a seat belt for my safety (Uh-huh)
Looking out the window, notice all the essentials.
From a block party that stops for a second, then rekindles
I heard that from a block away, he probably had credentials
Hello Mi-Miister Miyagi, I love you Kenwood woofers
The murder was the tune, you should know what the chorus is
You were with your dad on Bullis Road
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow like Coltrane, blow like Coltrane
Blow like Coltrane, blow like Coltrane
I shoot like I know Big but I'm huge
So go tell them I killed him, you fucking informant
I'm on air with him like a new pair of Jordan
Walking to the church bishop said he lost his Bible this time
Those are the images that I give when I pick up a rhyme ...
Jay Rock motherfuckers you know what comes after that
Watts City, Baby of the East
Now I'm in deep space when I write, no pen or pad on my mind when I write
You can't make me, this game is like an ocean catching a black floating on top like a ship ... Rock!
Kendrick Lamar, Rock and Tone put you back in your seat
I'm back in this piece
Join the cause or hit the hills when disaster strikes
The passion in me
Ali, you are thirsty on Twitter!
You boo-boo!
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say it's the key to my blessings, and if I speak well
Money flows like water, I'll just wait on the dock
Always screaming who doesn't like it and who he kicks it with
To the car he drove last year or who fucks with whom
I'm trying to surround myself with people who inspire me
To do what T-A-K-E only to reach T-O-P
Because every time you come
Shut your mouth ... scary ass
You'll be screaming that whoop-de-whoop, bla-zay-blah
He says, she says
Come to my house just to talk about your own people
Because every time you come
Say "Shut up!"
You get off, you're weak
What is HiiiPoWeR?
What we are about to do is raise the level of expectations.
You don't have to be rich
It was given by God, but now I am God, I hate to intervene
I'm writing you a letter like that of the police K-9
Can you hear me? I'm a damn problem, fucking
And they tell them that K-Dot did the following
But of course I am a short fuse ready to blow
Go to the head and lower your gun, we can go face to face
Tick-tock, boom when you babies give me some room
A breath of fresh air, DJBooth.net and Dot
My life is likely to see great efforts
When she wears a tight belt
In time it will come
Do I have to run in your place and start exploding?
Better yet, steal the closest Nix check cashing
Then come home
Go out and get it
See I'm trying to get the shit I write
The engine appears in this old school run tonight!
You know you're the best boy, you have to keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep it inside
About to explode, and I'm going to burst whoever's in my way
Loyalty, I have royalty in my DNA
Cocaine room, I have war and peace inside my DNA
Reality, I just kill shit because it's in my DNA
I have millions, I have wealth accumulated in my DNA
I darkened, I turned evil, that rot inside my DNA
Yeah that's it again the sound on the engine is like a bird
The problem is, all that silly shit inside your DNA
I wish I had been fed sorry
And the pessimists never hit my nerves
This is my inheritance, everything I inherited
tell me something
Dodging bullets, reaping what you sow
And stacking the images, living on the go
Only the Lord knows I've been hammering
The phone is never on, I don't speak
You're not shit without a ticket on your plate
Love let's talk about love
Is it something and everything you expected?
All the stars are closer
But you can't bring me the truth
Fuck you and all your expectations
Oh, are you important?
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams let me know
Or does the feeling haunt you? (Den)
All the stars are closer
I have, I have, I have
Eyes wide open
Standing ovation and celebration for our DNA.
Demons who like to dance slow
Bloody Jordans and Popeye's
Remembering Zion
Tigers, bears and lions in every jungle that I am
I'm hurt nigga don't do me
I watched him as he brought a fifth of Henny to his head in memory of his brother.
Clinchin 'his fist in an angry shit
I did my best to make him deny
The corners become monuments for the dead.
Rest in peace, the yellow tape blocks the streets
A baby mom screaming at the police
But you don't understand
Can you imagine we're just a bunch of niggas, but the picture here is an untold story
Babies of the late 80s weren't born crazy, we were raised that way
Complete chaos when we stop taking X and St. Ides pills
He returned fifteen minutes later.
"We saw some niggas slipping and I just started clapping
I love you nigga, be sure to hit me tomorrow
I got up, I went to Rite-Aid
Hoping the pharmacy department had the right help
I bought it and left
(The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh ay)
It's a revolving door
All my life
Fucking, right?
What if a dream were reality and reality was a dream?
And as complicated as it seems, if the things we imagine really happened.
Well, scratches mom's lottery tickets knowing it's just a fairy tale
Every time you're coming in, it feels like the devil is holding a pen
It's not a game, it's nothing to play with
That means what I'm thinking is correct
Hit, repeat the beat for a minute
Moment of silence for J. Dilla, on the way home
If dreams were reality
The only way to escape poverty.
I suggest you go back and hit rewind
Deep in my thoughts like Patrick Ewing in the painting
Look what I brought to my state that they can't bring: the industry needs a solution
We just love to hate each other who fight for greatness
Take that blue pill and then we start seeing spaceships
Knock each other down, crab in a bucket effect
The materialistic things we buy now don't mean anything later when the dream begins
Traveling without direction, the victim aimlessly
The streets mowed it down, I can't get past that
What happened in Manhattan happens all the time.
In the hood, conspiracy to cover up the crime
I wrote it in my mind as a letter to the President.
The same stage looks at us like some educated apes
What if a dream were reality and reality was a dream?
Get it with the Glocks
K-dot is hot
You don't have to tell me, I know I'm the shit
I am faithful to what I represent
How to learn your lesson?
Get it with the Glocks
For my niggas that taste good
K-dot is hot
In fact, you should take four b
For my niggas who hate fighting
Get it with the Glocks
Quickly push your dome like a hot comb
Now who's fucking with me? Me and that weapon we were born Siamese twins
I swear that in the vocal booth is where I will take my last breath
You sit and look at the little boy with my stacks of money
For my niggas that taste good
K-dot is hot
You don't have to tell me, I know I'm the shit
(Exercise for me, exercise for me)
Swinging swords like he's training with a Spartan
I drop a real gem like a Martin, fool
There is no trial for a plaintiff
But I have been away from home. since '03
I'm J-A-Y, Rock to be exact
Niggas said gardens, Watts on the map
All my life in the ghetto on the side of peace nigga
Niggas don't box, they buy more guns
Don't sleep don't sleep
My daddy told me that every day
Then reality begins to settle down
I am married to the streets and have never had a wedding.
Guns in the closet for niggas starting to stumble
Stay home when helicopters spit out
Crash them like thunder
Honey, I told you so many times
Just to remind you, baby
God save you Maria and marijuana, times are hard
Might be upset, infomercials and not sleep
Look, once inside the Nickerson Garden projects
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
A four year old boy telling his babysitter that he needed her
Fifteen, scraping her quarter jeans
But the witnesses could not prove it
With a curly top and a hole in the teeth.
Hustlin 'on the side with a nine to five to freak out
Thought you would get on the good side of these niggas
Two extra cookies, Anthony liked it and then let it slide
One curse at a time
Inside the recording studios where they get their benefits
Efil 'nivres eb dluoc gwaD poT, ykcuD dellik ynohtnA fi esuaceB

Ha ha ha, Lady G, Whaddup?
Apparently you are nothing more than mannequins of the industry
And rhyming like Rakim in '89
I don't want to pack a nine just a mind full of wisdom
Don't load my vision
And my hip hop doesn't stop as I sway
I have a buzz like a photo from Palmer Sun
And women fall in love while falling in love with my crotch
Do you hear the difference? I'm great like that
The reality in my bones is the DNA of life.
I'm looking at all of them like a fastball: attack!
I'm comfortable enough to go and relax with a Huxtable
For those who say it is great: but the irony is that I could hold the bottom of an iron with the palm of my hand
I say so much, so little action, don't talk like a mime throwing gang posters
I am a jaguar; you're just a new cat now back off
Aiming at the top like an AR aimed at your neck
Nipsy got street cred, Jay Rock got street cred
We are not what you think and think we are back
I need them all to feel me
Does no one pray for me?
You know, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Here we go!
So no one prays for me, I'm in your head, ayy
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I stop, I go out, I go out, I make it look sexy
A rich imaginary nigga, ayy
We are fine, we let the A1 fly
Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checking me heavy because I'm going, yeah, I'm going, yeah
None of you fucking with the flow, yeah, the flow, yeah
You know this will never be a tie, just look at his laces
Mr. one to five, that's the only logic
Damn everyone if you don't (Yuh)
Because it's all in your eyes, most of you tell lies
Most of you don't fade, most of you have been warned
If I gotta slap a nigga I'll make him look sexy
It is the only one, the largest in the world, the Kid Capri
Nah, take me out of my element

Bad trips like "Yah!"
Homie, you fucked up
But if God has us, then we'll be fine
We'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Uh, and when I wake up
Which MAC-11 even explodes with the bass?
You wouldn't know
Looking at the world like, "Where are we going?"
Motherfucker, you can live in the mall
I can see evil, I can say it, I know it's illegal
I don't talk about it, I know about it, every day I do sequels
I rap, I black on the track, so rest assured
Nigga, we'll be fine
I didn't want to destroy myself
Lucy's ills were all around me.
Kobe really retires
Back to Kobe, fallaway pull up
Oh! What a way to end!
Never meaningless could never mean less
That's what you mean right now
Jack to Jeanie
I make sure that you do
The off-glass buzzer on D-Wade
The helicopter
The range of emotions mixed with you and ourselves is so deep
I don't think anyone can break that bond.
Even your DNA is put into these L.A. concretes, man
Know it's never goodbye
And this from a person who never believed in religion.
I left the church, then I got a call that my friend was killed
What I am going to do
(Don't give up, don't give up ...)
Faith
(Don't give up, don't give up ...)
It's jungle when niggas at the zoo
Cats lying through their teeth, my nigga didn't deserve it
It's wrong to see my faith try to leave me
It's so hard to get it, getting rid of it is easy
I'm trying to get to Cloud 9, that's what my niggas fight
Because you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
I saw people I know pray and catch the Holy Ghost
Woo woo woo (she has a good head)
Woo woo woo (she has a good head)
Tell your girlfriend i hit him
Wee wee wee (that's funny to me)
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
I was in high school
Bamboo earrings
I put it on
Well you know curiosity killed the cat
So as we walk home from school, show me where you live
She went out, she jumped on the phone, girl who did that
So I can get some fame on my tube set
Wee wee wee
I think about when I chased that cat
Maybe get some dome
And then I left
To the next
Let them play the good role and then we make them cake mix
But I will be damned if I give them my brochure
I'm too proud to beg, sorry, left eye
If I don't do it in life, motherfucker I tried
I need, I need
Sick of chasing, your time will soon come
Not your mom, your dad, only you are you
Have you ever felt that nobody understood you more than you?
Very, very far from here
Instead of solving problems
Reaching for the skies, pissing on a cloud
Shitting on a bird's head, higher than a fear
As I fly through the galaxy, pain and agony
Shaping my style on the streets, bring darkness to light
A schoolboy who will soon be a star, Mr. Lamar.
Very, very far from here
I don't think I can find a way to do it on this earth
What's up, family?
Why God, why God do I have to suffer?
Reffus attog I od doG yhw, doG yhW
I hit you, who bought you that?
You stole it, I hit you if you say the game is broken
With tears in her eyes, running away from Poo Poo and Prentice
It is better that the pizza is not wasted, it eats everything
It is better that this television is not noisy if you have it on
I will die prolifically because I don't know that Demarcus was snorting
I'm going to die at these parties at home, fucking bitches
I'll probably die trying to calm two friends arguing
If I could shake the fear away, I'd roll that motherfucker up
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
My newly discovered life magnified me all
Fear of spending money, made me sleep from hall to hall
The shitty guy will make me turn around and just kill something
I practiced running out of fear, I guess I had good luck
Inside fourteen tracks, made on wax
And I can't carry these feelings with me, so I hope they disperse
God damn us all
So until we go back to these commandments
Because he said he will punish us
They are the true children of Israel
That man punishes his son, so the Lord, your God, punishes you
God bless you
(No one prays for me)
I feel that you can be the problem
And fuck you if you get offended
There is no one praying
I am a legend, I feel that you are all peasants
I don't feel your presence
I feel that your feeling is not mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
The darkest hours, I lost it
Fill the banks with dollars
Fill the graves with parents
Fill the shit babies
I feel like this must be the feeling of where Pac was
The feeling is toxic, I feel like I'm boxing hell
Sponsors, industry promises.
Niggas, bitches, honkies, cookies, Compton
I feel like saying something, I feel like taking something
I need a nigga baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
Fuck you nigga don't call me anymore
Eat your leftovers and raw meat
This dick is not free
Too bad the fool who made prosper how beautiful there is in you
The juice from the tits and pussy lips kept me nasty
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
My check with less support left me idle
Dusty, damned, disgusted, forced with
The choice is devastated, the horseman beheaded
Now my dick is not free
You know the stress continues, now your children reap the mistakes you made
Are you celebrating me as an artist or just as a prophet?
Snippet 3 lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
But remember, he knows the Bible too
Now baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of order.
But you and me pushing daisies if I (love you)
When I turned twenty-six, I said, "Oh shit."
I'm Lucy, I heard prayers on your first album, really
I want you to know that Lucy caught you
Now baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Smoking, drinking that potion, you can see me deviating
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
I didn't want to destroy myself
Lucy's ills were all around me.
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Lucy is going to get your mom out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion as promised
It's not that easy
Lucy you don't care, because at the end of the day you will chase me
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
Jesus takes the wheel [inaudible]
Homie you in one
But if God has us
Then we will be fine
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Schemin ', and let me tell you about my life
Everything I sow, then comes my karma
Tell the world that I know it's too late
You wouldn't know
Hitta, and we hate po-po
My knees go weak and my gun could explode
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Whatever, look, my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Look, you can live in the mall
I don't think about it, I deposit every zero
We'll be fine
Hey? We'll be fine
Mixing hen with similar my mom knew I had a problem
I am an innovator C-O-M-P-T-O, energizing
You know
I'm not trying to entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend will like
She says she loves it when it sounds like this
She had a long day and I also know that she wants to let off steam
This shit that my girlfriend will like
I'm playing shit, my girlfriend will like it
I even threw him a jumper just to play it safe
How many i fucked
I'm not trying to entertain you other hoes tonight
I'm playing something that my girlfriend will like
I told you that my girlfriend will like it
(Verse 3: Ab-Soul)
Kendrick I have you
Kodak moment every time we're in sync
I wrote shit that my girlfriend will like
Niggas with chains and white t-shirt
Baby, tell the truth, yeah, you know that ...
Make it 1X-Tall, crisp with cotton fashion
(Is it correct? Is it correct?) We have it running
ARCO station in Avalon, a relative hit me when it happened
Platinum FUBU jeans with rubber bands tied at the bottom.
Could take the green Larry Bird on special occasions
The bounce then throws up, a rare gem, you duck
This is not for you, so what?
Kendrick:
Coming out of the top of the dome
Kendrick:
Troi Breeze:
I grew up on it like it was a tree with you
I try to get out of that energy, I know you feel my "inner G"
They don't want to shoot back
Make noise for my nigga
Make noise for Troi Breeze
I've been looking for that correct one
I found her
Shout me his number and he said be sure to call, oh
A friend of mine said you have a good baby pussy
Can i try baby Because I'm curious, curious
I said I need it baby because I'm very curious, curious
A friend of mine said that you are good company
I have to have it baby
I can be your lover, be your friend
Do it your way like a custom made shoe when you need it
Or maybe like a Burger King chain
And if it goes well, we can make you a change
So please tell me that you accept my proposal
Hallelujah, K. I won't do you
Sharing war stories with the deceased, I'm brain dead
On fire make a rapper burn his soul
Number one, city in my rearview mirror
With the bomb, the punks jump to be defeated
Charge then aim
There is no judgment for the plaintiff
(Fuck a hook)
(Fuck a hook)
(Damn, genius)
They hydroplan, hoping to get their big break
In a stolen Cavalier like me I took LeBron
(Psss) Now that's an Ab-Soul stretch
Call me Dolomite, no, I take that
I found out it's gay like a happy day or the way you rap
(Curse)
And yes, I like to fuck, I have a damn problem
I love bad bitches, that's my damn problem
And yes, I like to fuck, I have a damn problem
Or maybe white on white, Ku and Klux
I have mine but one is not a dollar
And yes, I like to fuck, I have a damn problem
I love bad bitches, that's my damn problem
I love bad bitches, that's my damn problem
And yes, I like to fuck, I have a damn problem
Let's say she is from the neighborhood but now lives in the valley
I got your girl on my line, world on my line
That doesn't mean shit to me
Yes hypnotize, it caught my body but it released my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? No one will win that war
My details will be retailers, man, I have a lot in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines.
They are leaving work and want to see Kendrick
Everyone please hold your wallets
That is dazzling and roasted, oh my
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, damn
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, knock it out when you take it off
I'm not an activist, I'm not Einstein before the calculation
I'm just a messenger, yeah, I know life is a bitch, make the best of it
Put 3 on top, they realize we're up, HiiiPower
Demons trying to kick the addiction of sucking glass dicks
Vivid images go against any fantasy you can imagine
My innocence would eventually see an obstacle
I heard it on the bed in my bunk.
Her red eyes is smoking marijuana mixing the two eleven
Beyond the streets and stay to be on the honor roll "
Raps backpacks with gats
And they want stripes so they shoot the bikes and you know
He tried to launch his flame, but I bent down and stabbed him.
That's a metaphor for any rapper who wants it
You probably think I'm dumb like it's the most real shit I wrote
I look at them four walls and I rap like I'm mad at God
And of course when that took its course
Assassins in sight, privacy obviously lost
And the fraudulent piracy of the streets in my odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed
I walked down the street without heat
And I find beef when I'm just vegan
Reekin 'the scent of a saint, a sinner, smells and then begins to squeeze
I'm really from the sect, though (Bomb, bomb)
And whether or not it is, I still need to know
Where are you from, where are you staying or where is your grandmother staying
I saw them from afar and then I saw a piece of my jaw
When you listen to amazed people
Like "damn it, he did it"
My friends are not alarmed
I guess this is the part where my heart
A cloak and some superpowers can't save me
I do my things (bomb)
Of an officer, he decided for you
Like the colors pink and yellow in Wesley Snipes
Revenge of hatred is what I'm facing
Yeah look buddy i gang bang
When you hear the next shot, you know that L.A.P.D. is the biggest gang (Pump)
I do my things (bomb)
I'm really from the sect, though (Bomb, bomb)
Where are you from, where are you staying or where is your grandmother staying
Where are you from, where are you staying or where is your grandmother staying
Yes. How do I sound out there Ali? Good? Then good
I had to hide the bottle because there was a mixture with Hennessy and soda
Every time we went up we were sober
I could have lost our lives to the hood rats
We were stupid as shit but luckily for us we were lucky
Size 5 Jordans, sports Rolex and wants to fight with everyone he meets
She said "No", he said "Oh yes
Rosecrans and what? She said, "It doesn't matter, I just know I'm lame
She said, "Yes, Daddy, can I get you out?
If you come, be sure to bring a drink
And that she did, that Friday was where she lived
But he didn't give a shit because he wanted to fuck that bitch right now
I walked around the house, with my rubber boots on
I kissed that bitch on the mouth and then I walked to the door
Get your ass killed, bitch! How?
Hoes hoes, scandalous hoes
He was not born, Boys in the Hood the movie made him think that everything was fine
Never withdraw if you don't use it
That's how he killed his bitch!
Yes
Him like a trombone I'm so impressed and um
So come on, you got the one with the drum
Boss man, pimp stro, pimp stro
I can let go of my money when the wind blows
And make the bitches understand me like 10 fo
Niggas it's simple, like instrumentals
Come to the beach and find
All I need you to do is shut up and ride
I had a Lammy at school
Now i have yesterday's food on me
That was very rude, friend
500 degrees this time biotch
Man, I have weed, pills, pistols, all crack
Bitch niggas, where are your hearts?
You won't be doing stunts like us
I'm about to close it from summer to fall and back
And the wheels of my car you have all that
It's not October 31, but we've masked ourselves, and guess what
And hot mom because you wake up in that white thang
Me in my building with 20 bricks on the roof
And all my people wear chrome: we are monsters, man
Baby Blue Mercedes Coupe - I have it bulletproof
Make me shoot my duke 80 on your damn ceiling
Bitch, hit, bitch, hit
Take them to church
Mom don't cry
Grandpa is gone and Grandma is not coming home today
But
Although I'm under the gun I'm aiming for the sun
So i sold that
So I held dat
Vaseline it and send it in gel packs
I failed what the teacher used to scream
But my mom knew her baby was cooler.
But you can bless me with it (Bless me on my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But you can bless me with it (Bless me on my chest)
My mom Mia doesn't raise Fredo
Do you have to make that thing flow like a?
The face blows, the gats
Photogenic, we expose a rat
I'm dodging the county boys with their bats
Ball with me
This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with it (hit me in the face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
I'm where the G's are
We like "where are the G's?"
C Notes no B Floors, you understand me
As fast as the wind blew, they too left
Probably shouldn't talk like that
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Because I kill them with the current, I kill them with the current)
Sleep on me, I hope you die while you sleep
Honking my horn so be careful of the beep (be careful of the beep)
I come from the city of God (God)
I made it and I'm still coming back
Don't talk to me unless you're talking about paper
And you don't come back with that paper
It started in the back, bitch
But now I'm winning, it's clear
For real
And my nastiest hoes are clean as shit
Come wet the party and whoever
Repetition, that's the definition
I really travel like a pilgrim, nigga
Going zagga zow out of zagga xans
My bitches sleep next to my bitch's house
So every party is a pajama party
He showed her more than love, she just shrugged
Just let it bleed and ignore the blood
Good bust like shit, every bullet hit
That's a muscle car, it made me look amateur
All these rings, call me buttons
To hold; cloudy, cloudy water, yes
Floating purple ribbons, yeah
I'm cursed, but I'm still religious, damn
Why do you hate skinny damn
Purple, purple rivers
Curse
New feet
Fuck you bitch
In Aspen
Great lights, "Action"
Money on the mattress
You know I am a boss; chilling out chilling out
You little niggas, so you ain't on my stand
Light a new L
I'm acting brand new (new)
Your camera has never seen such a beautiful photo
It's probably because my game is tight fixodent
I'm fucking every bad bitch twice
I hope you bring a gun to the fight
Aight?
Do you think you're cool
New feet
New scent
Put out the cockroach
Fuck you bitch
I'm acting brand new (yeah)
Sitting low in the seats
But I ride like this because I'm hotter than the others
I promise, the flows don't stop
I bet you hide under your blankets
New car
New feet

Su Weezy Wee, Mannie Fresh and Unplugged
We had those bitches addicted like it was a drug
Give me a big sweet Spanish ho, black from Puerto Rico
Freak ho, specializing in giving me deep throat
Aww shit, I like Jamians and Hatians
Niggas can't stand it when they jerk and make me rape them
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
Looking for the best penny for wine and dinner
Put the pickle in the middle, make it move for all of you
It may be small, but that dick is not small at all
As cheeky, he turns like Trina, "Da Baddest Bitch"
Wait, wait a minute, relax, stop
Look, I'm getting a little bold, won't you bring a friend?
I really just want you to break me
I really just want you to break me
Girls are like school, and I cut them like old people
Glocks like the police, bombs like Finas
Church, like a choir and a couple of old priests.
Test the heat and I'm going to put the toaster in your kidney (Uh-huh)
Then I stop at a Bentley, the top open like a fireplace (Damn it!)
Candy slab, paint dripping like clap (that's disgusting)
The way I lean bothers me if I stay still (wait)
Your bitch under my sheets, I heard she was an undercover woman
Your girl like a movie, she will come soon
A couple of screws are missing, you don't want to play with it
Don't play, ho, you know my name ho
Duh, nuh, nuh
Bricks in the beat, huh
Ladies and gentlemen, people with jobs, people without jobs.
Middle class, upper class, upper class, all that
Who, Weezy F, reverend, preaches about me?
Ragout seats, twenty the shoe
Boo, you and I have a lot to do
And I sleep with the sharks, shawty, in that water, water
Weezy the Don, friend, read between the lines
Or better yet, the army, you will need them for me.
Sleeping with women who sleep with the Hornets
Uh, get off, uh, get off on Pac's young footprints
The best rapper alive since the best rapper retired
The whole brown paper bag (Uh-Oh)
All brown all brown - Fi-Fi-Fill (Haha) even with more
I have that paper bag full of paper, bag full of kush
Those bitches sign up for me, tell them I'm with Swizz Swizzy
They call me Wizzy Fizzy, holla back, now I'm busy
Look at my car collection, yeah, look at my tires, ho
I have a helicopter with a drum and an ice cream one
16 years with a new one, Jag bitch!
Get up in the air
I'm from the ghetto so give me my pesos
You have a cock, then you book
I woke up in a new punani
I got some shit built up, I keep it inside
Wait, all the shit aside
I'm at the finish line, your heart is racing
Don't stop, pop that won't stop
Drinking fool, inflating a J
Strange, always strange ...
She is sucking me, I am rummaging through her brain
That wet pussy, I call it rain
I keep it a hundred, you do the same
It's safe to say it's a uniform exchange ...
Do not give information
I give that vagina to Dasani
Young Money
Man I feel like a gang star
Percocets and Addies, looking for shit I can give
All these damn bitches plotting, why can't they let me live?
When my album releases these bitches, she's going to cry in the car
All your men out here lying, you had to die to train
Although I'm here living, I'm living here
Slimes around here twinnin 'though
I am the Queen (Acts), I am all that is missing
I've been that bitch since the ice cream with the sparks
Yes Yes Yes Yes
I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Pop X with my exotic dancer
I put her face down on the pillow, about to suffocate her ass
Oh I have a Draco on the couch, an Eggo in the toaster
Take you down at the Walmart
Like a red stain on clean snow
And we walk with bloody fangs
Play hungry games; mmm-delicious, man
Hit the steering, knocking down picture frames and other stuff
Vomiting east like stomach aches
Pop X with my exotic dancer
Change your whip, put it in a Mercedes
Now she yells' Rest in peace for Uber
That's sick shit
Don't look for donations
I start humpin 'as soon as I wake up
Trash in your trunk, I hope my trunk can fit
The TEK on my thigh and my aim so good
Fuck you with a real nigga get killed
Pussy feels like vacation
Eat like I'm starving
I used to be in them heat games
With better seats than Pat Riley
Pop that Ollie, Tunechi
Wine head, she is eating grapes
Hating blacks, be hungry
No flowers were sent, but we fucked in the Rolls
Royce - trick!
Now they are angry, I told them they were
Most women face it, but who do you blame?

Drop Maybach, clean like Ajax

Hoody follows me, that's my big dog
I said, "I'm jogging right now," he said, "Okay, I'll pray."
And all the niggas I'm with, fight that gun game
One hundred dollars for a helicopter, that's a shot
I'm on the highway to heaven, highway to heaven
Wifey calls me, I answer: "Hello, honey"
I said, "I'll be back soon and call my thugs if I'm late."
"I love you"
Betting a hundred K on Green Bay
My Benz and my Wraith begin to feel betrayed
I'm about to have a little D'ussé with my steak
I said, "I'm jogging right now," he said, "Okay, I'll pray."
I have Hoody following me, that's my big dog
* Like five days *
For the right price, I can even get you Kanye

"I love you"
Mule
But now I have an actress stuck to my hip
You can roll the credits, and Shawty is my fetish
You know I like them fast and Shawty is the last number on my board
A couple cries a couple, I know you lying, lines
Pair of land, and we have our partner in
I wish they could all be California girls
California ca ca California
Man I wish they could be Californa girls
Uhh but Shawty is worth the range
And we say we will fight this until round 13
And in that box is a ring ... a ring
From my area codes I got them all from 213 310 323
As soon as we find her heart trapped, she's beautiful, I'm falling
But b4 everything ends, just remember, I'm dah uhh

Respect me for who I am: seventeen, head-bustin '

Now when a nigga runs
Just for the simple fact that I'm a hot boy, ...
The scene goes crazy, and everyone is going to die

They call me an assassin (Assassin!)
They call me busta head, Cash Money nigga (Killer!)
Than?
Niggas bitchin 'and I gotta carry the (cannon)
Listen carefully, I have duct tape and string
A hand on my money, a hand on my friend
Bullets like birds, you can hear them hoes buzzing
A short omelette egg
And tell him to "catch up" like mayonnaise
I'm the sickest nigga doing it, I bet you baby
Some niggas cry wolf, I'm in that dry kush
Yes, have a few words with him (Cannon)
Yes, tell my motherfucker (Cannon)
Hit him with four pounds and sink it, heat it up, then leave it stinking
You fools, better call General Motors, I will
Until I throw them in the wok like chicken, General Tso, uh-oh!
My good watch, Helen Keller, niggas
Throw it out the Range window with the rifle
The tracks burn the streets like a truck makes the gas
My outfit makes ladies say your man is too flying
Oils imported from Iran and Dubai
Yes, I am posted with the great friend (Cannon)
We got niggas that were caught on Pac hitting our shit
A good dough when on the mound your sauce
Just a cigarette, stuffed with Tropicana
If I'm not in the list above, black, the statistics are wrong
Good afternoon New Orleans
Nikk and Lil Weezy
Fallback because I do this here
Great light, green shoots, it's what I burn
A paper hunter until my thigh burns
The foot gets the steppin, yeah, bitch walks like ...
When all the lights go down
Should I vomit the deuce or shake the deuce?
Man I need some Krazy Glue
At least the bills are paid, the kids are safe
Do you want to get away? No i'm here to stay
I am choosing a partner, she is replaced
The heart was built to break
You can't break what can't be broken (Uhh)
(It can't be broken)
You wait, while he lies, then turn right and forgive
Until you get back with him, he doesn't change (I can't help but wait)
Until you see it with me, it's not the same (I can't help but wait)
You should have the latest, wallets, bracelets and watches.
And I don't want to come between you and your man, no
Put it together, you can do better
Sleep is the cousin, what a damn family photo
No matter who buys, I'm a celebration
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna
Bundle of six feet, seven feet, eight feet
(I'm going to go back to ...)
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
Glass half empty, half full, I will spill you
Try me and hit a wall; gardener
If these black animals, then I'll have a mink soon
Tell them bitches I'm saying put my name on the wall
Paper chasin ', tell that paper, "Look, I'm right behind you"
Get some Dramamine
Tease me, and you'll be all over the flo 'like Luda
I scream to ratchet for backing up on behalf of my shooter
I already told these shit niggas so many times
To feed them, in my routine, I got a little love
‘Because there is no peace on my side, bitch
Evil empire
I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just trying to hit it, hit it like I can't fail
I'm just trying to hit him, hit him like he couldn't
And I don't need no hook for this shit
I'm just trying to hit him, hit him like he couldn't
Ah ah ah ah ah

I do it very well, she calls me author
Shawty shawty, you can be hit like Brittany literally
Can't no nigga do it like me
This is
Rock ice like me
Advice when I walk, insults when I speak
Bitch, catch the? Quick
Good morning new york
I am getting bread in fear in Jamaica
Nicki, since I've been rapping, this is what I learned
All these other niggas pussy, like dry sperm (fuck it)
And I play this shit like Tom Hearns
Old southern habits, I spill it, spill it
I didn't stop, I was getting pretty, I have to diddy bop
Moms made dinner and then pots went to my popsicles
Lit up at 15, ooh, cotton mouth
Ooh, and I'm not coming down
I intended to write my mistakes, but was too busy to write them down
When your crew fishes, your body is found
Oh lord, I returned my mansion to the White House
I made a movie with Forest Whittaker, I understood my lines
My flow is like a shoe with the soles out, Dr. Scholl's test
Protruding extended clip, reloads rounds
Sex with a bitch, a deep stroke, oh, I was so excited
Next to the bitch there is a pile of coke, the mouth of your hoes
Mine falls, swallows the child without food
That means it has no teeth, holy cow, slow it down
I've never been a fan of knowing the vows
Everything I have in this world
It's a gun and a promise
Yes i'm from new orleans
Zero tolerance
Don't slip, you could fall and break your ass
There are no snakes in the Carter
Tell the gardener to cut the grass
I hear them, but they speak under masks
Chalk is for art only, buddy
I'm mounting repairs for them
It's better than paperless
You have to walk
I have to fly that paper
I have to know that
Photophobia
There are no Kodak moments
No, I'm not even in the school yearbook.
You better play by ear
I want the whole enchilada
And I don't have to get them
I say "what is really good?"
I make her say my name in capital letters
I'm smoking that black Bill Bixby
That wet pussy turned into a Gremlin
I kill them hoes
She grabs that dick with 2 hands
Like I'm about to pray for it
Fuck you and who gave birth to you
She opened her mouth: source of water
When I'm on the scene I'm on that inclination
Bitch, I put my foot up your ass: karate
Smoke that weed, let's go
Nina shut up, that bitch was silent
Top of the gun there is a scope
I just bought my girl a Ferrari Spider
I'm a black fact: Makaveli
I'm the fucking resolution like January 1st
I'm tired as hell but my cock is not
Smoking in that sticky bag
Get off that cooler motherfucker than some Certs
Uuh! Who the hell is Stevie J?
Just make sure my pillow is fluffy
Riding with them the chops, not the girls
I follow, I keep pimp
And they love the way I hang out with the team
Who do you think you are damn wit?

Homie I'm going hard

Squad Property Partner, Some Young Cats on a Mafia Budget
The way a black man lives is incredible and I'm going around something that you've never seen before and that it's better to see your baby mom before I stopped doing it!
In the kitchen trying to make a turn from 20 to 100 (yeah)
The boy returns, Carter yes
We in Miami stop at the teasers (yeah)
We're in a new shit that you niggas can't find us

And when they hear that new weezy, all the dough boys go crazy
And he jumped into this game on a roll
Nigga cooking this raw drug
I'm where the danger is nigga where eye contact will make you a natural meat bitch
And I had a g4 ice cream loaded with niggas bitches Stunna Islands that same night

Round of applause, make a round of applause

That's the word for my mother, she worries if I'm going to go home
Number one junior stunner! Hallelujah! fuck you! I wish I had never met you! PEACE!
I have a murder order in the magazine on my lap
My hustle is turning into a ravine
I touch them with every mannequin, my bag is full of money
You pass my mouth, I hang you on your balcony
Take a risk, put on this jumpsuit like a hooded bapes
I heard them all, merkem all with those four dirty
Handguns, one smooth, go ahead, bleed out
Chorus
You gotta suck your dick, if you wanna touch chips
Yes, and I'm sorry for the wait too
Boop!
Cash Money is an army, I am a one man army (yeah)
Now i don't want trouble
Tell whoever counts I'm in a hundred
I'm drinking, I tip a glass, nigga
I told myself to save myself
I need a head test (I need a head test)
I found the needle in the haystack, I put the thread
I tried to re-sew the wound, but I bled out
Yes, it is compensation for the conversation (no more conversation)
Sir, this game is a vampire (woo!)
Fuck that nigga, I'm knocked out
I'm still in the building
Takin 'over, Lord, I'm takin' over
And this that I'm sorry 4 the wait 2 (sorry for the wait)
Fuck these enemies, raise your board if you skate too
But I graduated from that shit, now I hate school
And now I'm taking, now I'm taking (taking)
You may have to slander again until the wait is over
If so then I have baking soda, I have baking soda ...
Come here and maybe you can get some sheets
Fresh (fresh) 6 pineapples
Baby, I'm brainstorming, call me a floodhead
And when you're really rich, then asparagus is delicious
And I'm on the streets with that, I'm on the streets with that
I'm in the bank trying to collect
Okay
I have a pillowcase full of guns
And let them feel that bass pump, haha
These niggas are crazy that man M-14 leaves you physically screwed
Haha, these niggas are ducks, well you can call me Scrooge
I'm going with a gun like a Nintendo, they're soft
They niggas fall when the wind blows
Where my niggas are, is playing it in raw weather baby
Come on, nigga Come on, it's time to do it nigga
I got niggas to be in that area in that wound
Oh it's a game, but it's a game of life and death
You lose and cannot continue if your dome is checked
Get into that water and get wet
I think you can fuck with me, your thoughts will get angry
Nigga Come on, Nigga Come on Wodie!
Give me the guns, I'm ready to blow a nigga
Imma Uptown Stunna, what the hell do you think
And you can take that to vegillity boy
100 rounds brought down the entire block
Mac uzi achine with a strap around my shoulder
But if I open my trunk, it could trigger a damn explosion
I have a sawn tec and I'm about to hit your brain
Nigga Come on, Nigga Come on Wodie!
You don't have to trample wodie, here I come nigga!
That's all I ask for, baby
Hey now if you rock with weezy
And I don't treat you like a souffle?
For granted, because of course (Yes)
My love for you is real (Ohh)
Yes
Yes let me catch my breath
Then you will have to settle for less
And I'm not Elliott Ness
I'm not saying this to shake you (saying) (haha)
Everything is fine when we make love (We are fine)
All I ask is that you don't take our love
My love for you is real (Ohh)
It's funny how that song hasn't aged yet
For us so let's project
If I have one
Thank you Mister West
I'm out
I see you with your palms on your pants
I'm a heavy smoker and a little drinker, yes!
I spin it on my finger (yeah) I'm a critical thinker (yeah)
We are in the belly of the beast, yeah
If this real nigga business then unemployed niggas
He jumped into the celly, called Makaveli
He looked at himself in the mirror and said: "You are a sick black man"
But I, I, look at me, I have the world in my hands
Life is a bet, better check the extent of the point
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need medicine
I'm fucking ready so I come prepared
I spin it on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a heavy smoker and a little drinker
I know your name ...
They love me ... and compete for their love
Uhhm, the competition is different these days
That kind of things
This is just to clarify the fact that I'm a damn mack
Elegant as I want to be born to be hustla, I'll be rich until I'm gone
I bet I'll reap this when I'm gone defeat this while I'm here
I'm a man for another man for a bitch I'm a pimp in the whip I'm a hundred thousand
And everyone saw you and she's not a bitch
But nigga ain't slipping 'cause I'll kill a punk bitch Word Up!
I'm a damn man, so respect me as one or the technician knows your son
You want to be me and you don't even understand me
And it advances a little because of the pine
My niggas call me little Russell Crowe for my beautiful mind
Got Streets in the building Gotti in the building
Shit, I must have been 7 in 8
And coming from the kitchen was an echo of all the bass
So I stop being lazy and I got creative
And all that pot is for me
But does its water help your garden grow ... no
Yes, I know it was crazy
Without seeds
So she can't eat
I lived the numb life
It made a lot of sense for me to run
Since I was little, since I was little, I took my gun
Because blacks are crazy
You should be proud of me
And my temperature is rising
Somebody shower me
But she just says "Baby", she just calls me "Baby"
M.-O.-E
Time is money, so I spent it all trying to ask for more
They say beef is the sport of a poor man
This is a checkup, now who do I write it to?
You can cut your head off with a saw, yeehaw
Money on bitches and above the law
And if the bitch steals, I know where her mom lives
25 lighters in the dresser, yes sir
Already boy Paul Wall
I know that they are on your side too
No, both in the trunk
You don't want my niggas crawling through you hooood (through you hoood)
If you're not like that (you know)
(Verse 2, Paul Wall)
Catch you short, run and hide
Hitting their legs and wrinkling
Then I hit the place with a bad bitch
I get hot, like Alonso
In a low post, I'm in the box
This flow got you out of character
I should have known you would cross me
I should have known you would cross me
My legs don't stretch out more than your wings, nigga
These niggas tryna be hoes
What happened to that boy and I'm not Pusha T?
Me and Future have a food fight
I should have known you'd cross me (Yeah who?)
I should have known you would cross me (I congratulate them)
I should have known you would cross me (I say goodbye)
I should have known you'd cross me (yeah)
(You are not built like this)
They say I'm not a rapper, I'm a trapper
I'm going to fuck your bitch in your crib, look at the kids later
I don't know, I should have known that she really doesn't love me
I should have known that she just wants to fuck me
I screwed up, don't judge me
Some of the niggas closest to me don't come
I should have known you would cross me
I don't cry for that
And I hardly fall asleep anyway
Yes
Now is the time to stop
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
If you understand?
If you can't bear it
Fake guys, please see that she doesn't date one
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
I take a pill to not feel the pain just to tell you this shit
By the hood!
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
So I'm flossing and if you run through me cross your mind you've lost your mind
How strong am I?
But the niggas wanna take out the darkness on I
Imagine, let the whole bottles explode
Straighten and neck
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
I lost my pop when I was 14
Pulling my nephews
Shit
And if you see a tear that doesn't mean I'm afraid, baby, I'm just a man and
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
Ro, D.I, my nigga Trill Real is coming to the hospital
I appreciate the step forward in the office
But you know that presidents don't cry, right?
Because this rap is real ... you know?
I hope you're not too tired to cry
Listens
I lost some friends and the pain still affects us.
And those fucking ass police dogs, teeth still clenched
I remember well, Beezy rolls the L
But now they all rap, my niggas, so now I must make it happen
Because even though we couldn't, the Lord saved him
He was a boy from the east, and so was Wesy West
So if I cry don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped the beat
So much shit just sit in this mind of mine
I smoke back to back
And fuck a man with a badge
Man you thought they killed corn bread
And the complaint continues
Or my late grandmother, Mrs. Mercedes Carter
The old man hurried until his heart stopped
But black would still not be a father to me.
But look how I finished, I hope you are happy for me
You are listening to the future Wee-z and F. Baby
I don't have high expectations, I just wait for my money
All my niggas are dancing, that's how this shit should be
I stop on my darling and put my dick in and go
I will put that dick in your stomach
You took the bitch out of the reservoir
I only answer when my niggas call
Hello how are you nigga
In nothing but a strap and I'm in my drawers
I mean, can I dance?
Started from below, nigga
I could take some shots, I could hit the grass
But the niggas spread their hands and I don't read palms
But I'm as DC as fat shoes
I wet the party so I have a swimsuit
Keep talking that shit you're talking about
You've never been over all that ... go back
Let them sleep on that, it's nothing to decipher
Nigga ... how do you want it huh coke or dog food?
All these niggas want war but run away from me ... Crack!
I'm on the streets, rushing, getting black money
Nigga got some more jewelry, we were making money
Nigga ... yeah we ride wood grain and mink
And that pussy shit they do
I'm getting cake like I'm Jewish
I made her work, twerkin and slurp my snake
I swear my mom trusts my job
So I give you these hoes that work
That's why it cost you to be killed
Man, I swear to God, I'm not nervous, uh-uh
And if black people think it's a game
She about to blow me up, like a signing bonus
She got a nigga but he ain't my bitch
If he twisted, I'll relax him
But I swear to God he heard it, yeah
I have no problem with this bitch and that's for sure
She went to ride this dick like the Kentucky Derby
I got a bad bitch, she Persian, call her AK when she's dripping
I have no worries like Tunechi
I want to hold hands and then watch movies
I'm doomed make a nigga lose it
Girl, I swear to God, I'm not nervous, uh-uh
I swear to God I'm not nervous
Fuck with Tunechi, you'll end up missing
She put Lil Tunechi in her booty, in italics
My bitch is thrown like me through her
Cut like a blender, chopper like thick
Shooting out the window saying Young Money motherfucker
My niggas are like Freddikets, my life is the theme
Make you feel in your chest, like breast cancer
I don't give a shit if you're in the cut
Shoot him in the back, just to get his back back
Stylin on you, I download this volume on you
You are so good that your body needs a bodyguard
I have whitney enough to
Yeah that funky monkey
Low
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Then I get to the money, from Monday to Sunday
The black that rhythms with the black C-O-O-L, Cool
Give, give, give, give, give, give, give
Weezy F Baby, F ya ladies so fast so fast
Yes, Mayne, police, pop, chop and slang where the police don't drop a thang
Corpses behind me, the cops will never find me
Arm & Hammer Clean on my way to the honeycomb
No luck, no help and we're the fucking future
And the main character dies in the end, usually
Hustler by law, support when I can
Smell my shit as I step off the stand
Nuts at my feet with my heart in my hand
Excuse my G, but I'm unique
If they stop me, bitch, I'll make time
So I must be smart, get bread or stay behind
Bitch I'm in that pattern fuck me bad and kill me
I have a silencer on the gun, that bitch goes "pu"
You don't want that friend
Life is full of options and your bitch chose (Nigga)
You know where I'm going, (bitch) I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!
I have a silencer on the gun, that bitch goes "pu"
Got-Got a disgusting swagga, my bitches too
Just a gangsta from the third room, dirty state, high rank
I spend because we are earning
Five stars, money and power!
Built on solid shit, the bad bitch was born rich
Spider (Shit), marble full of bricks
Bitch I'm in that pattern fuck me bad and kill me
Bitch I'm from New Orleans
And I come from Hollygrove
That bitch is wild like a safari
If you are afraid go see the deacon
And if I get into that pussy
I don't drink champagne, my stomach hurts
"Good night" these niggas, you look like these niggas
Hit it, look it up, hurry up
But bitches come with funny love
It's ashes to ashes, dust to dust
We don't wear masks, because it must be us
I'm a warlord for these damn boys
The policemen stopped and vomited
You all little niggas little time
It's still a time of war, a time of war, a time of war
Pull up, "Brrt", skrrt
The fireballs are reflected in the frames of the images.
The end of the world will come soon, I miss it
My astronaut helmet shifted a bit, full of lipstick
Leave a message in the dust just for me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
If I don't see it, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yes, yes, yes, yes)
On the dark side of the moon (Yes, yes, yes, yes)
Chrome in the monster
I'm taller than the solar
System
In myself, I'm playing
They bitches after me
She rode my dick
Fuck your balance
Yes i have soul all of you
Go back up, stretch it out and flip it over
Go back up, stretch it out and flip it over
Go back up, stretch it out and flip it over
I bet I serve them as my name Pete Sampras
But I hold my head up like my nose is bleeding
Hollygrove 17, I won't leave you
As a Muslim I am calm
The engineer is recording a storm
My hunger is formed
But the third time a charm
Holla
Now when I pass, you may see an extra shadow
They tell me "don't be fooled or shut up"
So until the day they drop my box, dammit
I'm going to ride with my Glocks up
I'm hitchhiking on the highway of life
It is very cold
You never do anything for a brotha like me
You sold me a dream of 40 acres and a mule
Engines flooded, suspensions in poor condition
Bullets start to break through the walls
She got that booty from hitting him fast in the car
I have the Jones soda with the drink
The party does not explode if we are not in it
Lame, then see if Tune, Jay Jones, Hoody or Mack want them
I'm in the club but I'm in the cut
They have cameras here like Oprah's here
Since I was a child, I heard gunshots, mothers cried, all the fucking soldiers listen
Abracadabra, abracadabra!
Copperfield, I just broke a seal
Don't ruin my account, pop two and I'm leaving
I'm waking up, I'm spending those Cali things, that massacre
I'm magical with chemicals and sensational stuff, Metallica
We come and go in traffic with that Macklemore
I walk on water, I float in the air, I'm there, I'm on your face
Wait, abracadabra, the data doesn't matter
Copperfield, I just broke a seal
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mule! Voila!
Mom, nanny, I'm doing my check
Music is art, Basquiat, niggas are square, hopscotch
I have not jumped Bungee, err, I have not been to Mount Everest, err, remove it, I have probably been to Mount Everest. Probably flew over him, probably passed and just squirmed, you mean? That's real shit, real shit, real shit. Hello to my friends, they will let you know that the slime has sat down and probably ate with the president, and whoever the president was at the time, I don't remember, don't you mean? But I do remember Obama saying my name in a speech and yelling Obama. But still, what haven't I done yet ... launch Carter 5
Money ain't shit, bitches ain't either
You know I'm in that grass, don't cut the sprinklers
And your main girl is a ho, I go to Wayne's world in his throat
My older brother is Mack Maine, so much grass that I have grass stains.
You chase her, I tell her, come in
Gas on my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy is good, I want to see her again
Yeah i'm from college park and i got you broad with me
All my gangsta niggas, all my freaks bitches
Man I'm on another shit, I want another bitch
Come on make millions with me
Because I carry, and I hit myself
Please say baby
Please, darling, please say baby
If you ever doubt me, you could do better
Ready for drama as Knots Landing's hoe
You don't need websites to know what bling-bling is for
Because I'm a clean monster and mom, she scares me
Holla to me in a fucking shit
Cash, young money that is more cash
Chyea, chyea, this is a dedication to the streets.
It's Gangsta Grillz, you bastards.
He didn't even see me with the gun in the shade
Pick up that pussy
Naw let him lie down
Out of my hip, empty clip like a muthfucka
I already smell it
I don't care what you know
And I hope your ass drowns when you suck my dick
It's like fixing broken cars, what tools will I use?
Look, I know what is what, who is who and who you are
I write with the light of the lamp on my nightstand
But still, I want to see more than my sight can
And yes, the relationship begins to feel like a chore
I am writing this letter to you, I hope everything is great
But I'm not trying to expose, I'm just trying to expand
Anne, I'm trying to stay out of the girls pants ... but I can't
This is more than a rap, it's more of an oath
And I know you're wondering what this letter is for
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
And sometimes I wish I wasn't him but I'm
But it's like you make me feel like I'm part of the family
With you is where my art can, Anne
Yes
Under the streetlights
But I still find my way, and when I do I keep going, and I'm
A black with stripes
Correct me if I'm wrong
That is why I have weapons and my weapons have children
And I'll be with them niggas
And none of them broke
And let your mom cope
Or else you're dying in court, mannnnn
Where the president is the enemy
So excuse my expression
All the time we just try
And did I mention without mentioning
Give me light, and I will shine
My job is to survive
So Lord, keep me in your eyes
I'm trying to say
Some soft, some stepped on, but we continue
And I slept with work many nights
If I crash, just lift my brain
And if they do, then I'm the nigga that you blame
And say honor to him, a bitch on his face
And whip the state like I whip the yay
Weezy, baby, that's what you say bitch
Travel while you're full and my clip is going to be empty
When stomachs are emptied, anything is tempting.
To stay, then they made us evacuate
Niggas doing anything, like, God will understand
But please understand us, niggas with mansions of lost money
Water to the attic, there the hiding places go
No cut, tell life: "So what?"
The grass slowed down, we can't even roll
Damn, make a dent in the money too
The end of the world is coming and my city is the proof, damn
And I'm going to die through these bars, believe me
I'm depressed for the cause even
I am a leader, I, the son of Jacida
Hello, mom says "don't let them see your page".
Do not let them copy you from your paper, let them see you well
"As long as you invest in something", I am invested in it
Nigga comes to me hard
I'm just trying to do my part as Cass, smart as Taz
And blacks hate me like rage
So don't be mad when you see me at Maybach or Rolls
Sitting so far with the seat, I'm in the trunk with the coke
I spit blood on a clue, call me Dracula mass
Buck: Do you remember when the bullet caught my brother?
Who do you think made that boy come out so cold?
If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be
Bugatti, new boo
Yes Yes Yes Yes
And see through the scammer and now he's a dying man
Be on the lookout for the spy camera
That a damn rock band under a rock, man
With some rock playing
You screamed "Suu whoop" and the gangsters loved you (Yeah yeah)
I'm going to Mars in this bitch, watch me orbit and shit
Be late as shit, you get sweet and spicy
In the spotlight too long, it should be darker than this
Fuck the white flag
I have no love for girls, I bend down and dodge
I grab them from their behinds and everything
Come on take it down, catch the wall
Tear that bitch dick, start buggin 'and
You gotta get your ass back with that, act like an ass with that
You gotta bend your ass with it, act like an ass with it
So when I'm talking I'm crawling and I come looking for something else
Number 1 Stunna, baby, he raised me
Always get the clique, make you fuck everyone
I have to go back to your wits, act like an idiot
Undress, show me something
See me, lil wayne, i put that dick, the babes can't even walk, they can't even sit
Clean your mouth and let me hit now
That rum made me feel really good
This Lil nigga has a lot of sex, so slowly, take off the Prada dress
Where the hot girls like that nasty shit
Make them act like an idiot with that, get your ass back with that
You know why I come here
Call me the iPod King
Call me what the fuck you want
Bang bang ... used to shoot you
The shiny black coupe at night looks like a leprechaun
She won't give Wayne that pussy, I'm so grateful alone
Shoot you if you block it, leave an awkward nigga
Damn, excuse me ma'am but I'm the man
And I scattered the motherfucker down all the blinds in your room
I roll up the sheet, fixing the slow leak from the game
I say I might miss you, but lil 'FeFe gon' hit you
Fuck the niggas and make friends buddy!
More like a change for the better
And this is just a mixtape, damn
You should have a gun for me, yeah (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
So fuck it, I'm going to kill them, fuck it, I'm going to kill them
You should have a gun for me, yeah (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Like Della Reese, I need celery
Drop them in a firestorm, YM riot squad, get fuss
Game of a man, nigga, I'll die alone
I don't bull, I push Pro-V like Pantene
Players jump like a springboard, tangerine
Crocodile Day, Deniers, Mascara Carriers
And my niggas on paper, getting paper like ball players
Rap niggas, forty cal. in front of you (Ugh, ugh)
I feed the niggas like a diner
You should have a gun for me, yeah
And all these niggas are murderers (murderers with you)
I will kill them
At the top, face painted like a clown
Reciting chapter scriptures, Proverbs, Leviticus
And lift your ass on a mission, become a competition
Still drinking Cristal, shaking the lifeline
Since life is a bitch, you lift up the skirts of Jezebels
YM militia, you niggas better retreat
Because I'm going to kill them, I'm going to kill them
And I kill them, I kill them
Same hustle, new money
This shit like pudding, going down
As if gravity knocked me to the ground (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Young
But, let me, just let me prepare them, let me know, uh, so you know that the future will rain, I'm in this rock shit
I know you'll like that shit
And uh just in case you want to know
Oh oh oh
Dreams of f ** king Mrs. Sarah Palin
Hey i make it much bigger than you did
House boy, you trip, fall and break your ass
I can rap fast but I like it slower ... why?
I have some bullets with photos of you
Haha, you really don't want me
Now listen man. This here is dedicated to all the young bastards around the world, especially in my city, the man from New Orleans. I respect how they hold their heads and stand firm after the disaster, you know what I mean. You keep your head up high after the disaster. Not only my city, there are all cities and there are all young people, not all young people, but almost all young people, or there is a young man everywhere who has gone through or has gone through his own disaster, or who is going through his own personal disaster. But not to end, so as not to undermine my city, you know what I mean, we went through a difficult one, and I want, I want the young mother to fuck that she knows that I see them all black. I see them all black. Making money in different cities nigga, getting money in different ways, nigga respect my city nigga respect a New Orleanian when you see him in your mother fuck. Because if they are not black, I will make them respect me
Everybody cross the [?], Everybody cross the Grove
If you don't know what I'm saying
So play this shit again, cause I don't know what I'm saying
The chicks and the people of the slums
I won't lose anymore
(This is dedication!)
Rest in peace!
I carry my mom's concerns
You have probably never been there, so now I dive
And they respect me like a gun, I'm fashionable
I'm the drum major, the drum section waiting
And I'm throwing my Scarlett O'Hara on the channel
Fuck you and you can kill automatically, yeah
I was prescribing medicine, you got your lesson from
Your niggas is an ass that is shit
Like "Oh shit!"
Weezy
I got flies on my new shit
Sit on this dick, feel like you're flying on a pterodactyl
Am I sleeping with the devil?
How the hell should I know?
She says shit I never heard when I thought I heard it all
Like you perfect but not perfect but you have the perfect flaws
She laughed and said "are you crazy" I said "look who's talking"
But I wonder if I leave you, would it still suck?
How the hell should I know if I'm sleeping with the devil?
How the hell should I know?
Oh, how well I know that I'm sleeping with the devil.
Pour a shot of a few and let me spit on this ho
I told that bitch to be cool, like the temperature drops
With your ass right, she says "give me a little more"
I like tall grass but I just trim it and go, I'm in my black shit
I call her wife, she calls me polygamist
Play with pussy, get wet, play with fire, burn yourself, the ceiling
Scream and cry infamy, mentally revive
Looser and tighter hugs, her tongue tied kissing me
I had a little revenge on myself so now I'm sentencing
She also agrees with my demands
I'm a demon with demands, I have demons on demand
The demon of man, you
He took his demon by the hands and asked: "Can we dance?"
She is sleeping very softly, so now they start to enter
A demon with demands
He took his demon by the hands and asked: "Can we dance?"
Demon with demands, demon with demands
I know you hear them scream things
My nigga
But I want to go around the world
Then I could drink your stash
I never think because I know
I'm pointy with your ho
I'm off topic
I'm relaxing, for the moment
And I'm drowning
While you cut your grass
When you have nowhere to go
Dump them by the boats
Until I get a full coin
When is your friend going to join?
I have a friend in the cut with a gun in the groin
I told that bitch don't question me
I'm spaced like asteroids
I'm in love with a beauty
Turn your body, don't be afraid
I say "Oh girl I love you so much"
Oh, oh girl, I love you so much (Psych)
But I don't give a shit about a dog's ass
Stop talking that shit and suck a black dick for an outfit
Oh she broke out at a handstand
And I'm the cameraman
When I can bow you down and do what I told you
You will probably see it on one of my shirts
Super soak a ho, skeet, skeet, skeet, squirt
Hey i'm stoned with the features
Haha, new single, oh, are you single now?
I'm a nigga from the east side, but my friends from uptown
I woke up on a mission, I have 2 women I travel with
We test niggas, so wisely choose who you'll be with
And they can't bite the hand I'm feeding on, I'm holding grenades
Then I'll talk my shit, I'll live my life
I'm going to nail you girl, shit, I did that twice
I'm a nigga on the east side
I've been a beast since I remember
Cut your head off and put it on the front of my car as the emblem
Get them, I got Mike Banger on the beat, I got this banger on display
I just tried a new Lamborghini and got an A
Just give me fellatio
My bitch named Gigi gives me head, I'm like God, grace, fuck
Boy I have people looking for you as a reason uh
Jump that Ferrari Spider for my children in Rikers and all my lives
But I make her say it like Tony the tiger
I have a rifle and I'm on the verge
Probably with my niggas, but my Polynesian bitch
I met this bad little woman, she had curves
Sipped in the middle of the day, I started early
Drop the top of the car, let the tits breathe
Michael Myers, Norman Bates, Charles Manson
Calicoe spat like an Uzi do
Bad bitch on my arm, that's my new lil boo
The pussy is so warm and it's Juicy Fruit
Trampoline with work, I got the block to jump
Wearing lingerie and heels around the house for me
We are drinking that dirty
We are drinking that dirty
We are drinking that dirty, you know
They haven't even heard from you
We put your wig on the shelf
They haven't even heard from you, now they have to look for you
It doesn't seem too good, too good for you
I ain't got no feelings for them niggas, no
This is how we do it
Lamborghini orange as vitamin C
I'm working like a bad bladder, M.O.B
Yeah nigga spitter who did you think it was
Bitches want to hug me in the morning like a cup of coffee
Serious pimping
That Testarossa can have ghosts like I've never seen you
The pioneer-a, I'm here-a, right here-a
Pretty women want this nigga here, like Richard Gere
I shift gear, and turn and disappear
Leaning like a motherfucker, I couldn't even say wassup
I bet I raised your bitch with no game plan
Niggas know I got bread and toast and tartlets
Standing next to heater in summer with oven on
Working that traffic, call me the cross guard
Red rags, where's my where's my B?
I have a bitch named Keisha, she is a real complacent
His girlfriend Lisa met her in Puerto Rico.
I'm not lying to her, the hottest bitch, heater
Yeah I'm a damn eagle, flying and deeper
Run, fool, finna hit
But have Nina Ross yell at me when I'm angry
That is what I trust, I left
He tall yeah I'm three tall
I'm just teaching these guys like DeVry
Hit as producers, eat as you like to produce
Now she can't produce, so you won't need that baby
Because all you really need is Weezy F. Baby
All right, let me vent for a minute
Who's letting these niggas in?
Dammit! Hey, Millz, show them how it's done.
But she brings it all to dad, so it's alright
Part-time runner late at night, she works at Strokers
Ugly little thing, from the house of the Ravens
Tiffany and Emily, my whores in good faith
I have a white girl in Florida named Sasha
And if she's nasty, we do the nasty
And I'm hella fly, and her fool fool friend
And I can't get girls, I make him bring me one for me
Paper chase, fuck money standing still
What do you say, are you or are you not my baby?
Ohh, this feels good, it's alright, Ye
Okay
Shit, I wonder if she knows well if she doesn't know
And you know it's because they probably did it before
I wonder if Tammy knows what I did before
That we did it before we knew they did it before
The day we did it but oh yeah they did it before
Because if she with it, I know she should be with it
That we did it before like we didn't do it before
But we did it before, hehe
Yes, so if you did it before, be a professional
And every time I meet a girl
Because I did it before and she will be stupid
As Busta Rhymes said, she holla "give me a little more"
Shit, I wonder if she knows well if she doesn't know
That we did it before, yes, we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows well if she doesn't know
Wishing everyone didn't know
That they did it before, like they did it, it would be low
Well if you didn't then be cool with that and it flows
How come you're not with him now, but you were with him before?
Shit, I wonder if she knows or if she hadn't
Yes we did it before
Ok put your hands up if you did it before
And now everyone says you did it before
Although it will be different
Because if she knew
Imma Tear Dat Pussy Up like I never did before
Wen I see them, I act like I didn't know
Yes we did it before
Yes we did it before
You know I have to act like I never did before
But she was knocking on the door
Ok, a lot of people don't like to say that Dey did it before
Wishen Dat that everyone didn't know
As if Dey made it down
Well if you didn't
You know you did it before
Oh..Dats Your best friend Yes Yes, kick it, I know
Probably licked it before
Because I did it, I did it before
(Chorus:)
Shit, I wonder if she knows or if she hadn't
Nu Jerzy Devil
So many girls under the time
I have no game, they know my story
I love brainstorming until his nose is runny!
Bring your own girl, I don't care if she's chubby!
I'm a weirdo
In a different outside world with a monster
So that made me a little hot
And what do I do?
I put on my boot and stepped on it
It may sound crazy but I have my head in my mind
Ha! Girl I'm nasty, I do my thing and they come looking for me like Lassie
I'm a weirdo
Slide your body down the pole and let me see you twerk
But on Saturday I'll have the devil lord so struggling
I told the waiter what I wanted
And i'm just eating
Just consider that bologna
In my tuna casserole
You look like nicole
I have faith and soul
Bowl of french fries
Hot and cold
Here's your main course ...
I eat your ass well, never leave a crumb sucka
I've never been a hopper club, I'm a club jumper
For being the best of all
Rappers call me
I'm a party
Carter puts it in order
Order me, it should be an artery
I'm a beast, at least
Now where is my dessert?
Never tip
And I can eat you faster
Feed me rappers or give me a heartbeat
Oh yeah
I hope you die 30 times, nigga murder moms
VIP - Then we'll be niggas hitting red
Don't drink Cristal anymore, just pour it on the white bitch's head
I just shot a video with R. Kelly but No Homo
I really didn't want to, but I fuck with TS and Fat Joe Joe
I'm rolling like stones
We are in Harlem popping
But it's the best!
I make him take a pill
And come fuck the set!
And this is my dedication
And I want to let you know that
Inside all that water
Inside all that dirt, inside all that blood, inside all that pain, inside all those screams
And trust me. I you we
Strength yeah
Fuck off

Fuck you with a hard cock
First of all, the chocolate women.
Wuchu going to do about it?
Jae Millz
Real Flow, Lil 'Mouse
D4 ho
Weezy, dip dip, Wayne set set
And I grab the Tecs, I leave them on the wet water bed
So it is "fuck the world" with protection
My words carry life, like a stretcher
Yes you know young Wayne here
Scholarships is here, Jacksons here, Franklins here, those dead motherfuckers
We got Vegas chips, nigga bet bet
I hope they are ready, because I'm a jet set
And sports car for lunch and pussy for dinner.
It's Weezy Baby, it shines like a brass jumpsuit
Take a pill, then roll again, now we're on the road again
With Santana, we too runners, like Al Qaeda
Hi. Look. What right there? Wait. [blows smoke]. Nigga eating gummy bears and shit. In the study. That album could be coming out. That was Disc 1. Drought 3. It's about being Disc 2.

Look

Chi west side where the shit gets so hood
Real as they come
Pitch black, the clothes
Spank my enemies
My monsters give good head
Hitting a murder bill
Runnin wit hotspitta
We were awake
I have to raise my seed
Now all my dogs in the bin
Looking at my chain like you're looking at a mirror
Me and money is like persimmons and polo shirts
Why am I so high? That's the drug
And you'll be eating bitches
Oh no, Hotspitta Dawg
I curse them and all they say is
"You are very crazy"
Flip your tight cap like Fred Durst
Yes i drink verses and like hooks
President, drive slowly
I'm in shit that didn't even come out of my ass yet
I just clarified that, moment of clarity
I have big chips, you get Alvins
Paint your face red, everyone gets ready
I'm killing this shit, dark, black flow
But I'm not done, uh-uh
No roofing motherfucker! Yes
I'm in the nigga red zone
Wake up in the morning with your black head
Leave the meat on the streets and bring the bread home, nigga
Yes, tell the doctor "Step aside, please"
I'm in the zone like high school
Don't lie bitch, I'm a flyer than a pet canary
Two women praise me as Mary Mary
We would both say
It came before late
I used to
And you used to obey
I have my business together
I wish I could meet
Lie
If it ever was
Out of the highest cloud
yes
Now
She would be a photo
I put it on my mom
We could
Brilliant white ice like Jaleel
Look at me whenever you want, find me, I'm the owner
They are yellow diamonds that look like a refrigerator full of Crowns
Own us, you see through cubic zircons
Hit them with the Glock
Lots of colors in da chain nigga fuck Bape
Yeah bitch, I'm cold like high
Chain on top of the chain man I look like Mr. T
And I got to the docks with the hickory
Pockets full of bank rolls, money while the train smoke
And it comes faster than a fucking black J-Lo
Do my thang, my fucking thang
I do my damn thing
Don't say it nigga, don't do it
I don't because I did (I did)
I rush to lotta bread
No we can't talk
I made it beyond madness
Stack them, back them up
They feel every slug
I pulled out a bag of coke, drizzled just a little
Deck with kings and cut queens
I don't because I did (I did)
I rush to lotta bread
Because I don't move it, I just run it (I run it)
All I write are checks
Homie, I'll be getting bread
Looking like a damn EAST egg
And the gain in the game if I target your brains, the bullets go through it
Look, I'll be labeled the swindler of the scammer
Because I don't move it, I just run it (I run it)
I noticed that the route I chose could bring fortune
(Chorus: x2)
I don't because I did (I did)
Because I don't move it, I just run it (I run it)
Look, and me and Mack only went to the blacks in the same hood, we fell from the same tree, we cut the same wool.
Chea, and I'm as sharp as an image, and I keep hitting it like a damn mother stain
Two twins drink me like guinness, when I finish I say brilliant, when I finish they say Weezy that you killed, I wait for your shit and they say Weezy that you healed him
It's Curren $ y, Weezy F Baby, Mack Maine
Those bitches, who you'll be connected to
And her reply was "do you know who you're fucking with?"
It's Curren $ y, Weezy F Baby, Mack Maine
Because all the ugly bitches stayed in the rain
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit on your lap
She says "I know you probably hear this shit a lot, but you are the shit in my opinion"
She says "Who are you kidding, boy? You like a thick bitch, big booty, big boobs"
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit on your lap
With my hand on your puller, I turn them black again
Okay, I know you haven't had a nice thick bitch in a minute
Just say'
Boy, this here will keep you warm at night
Eat well before taking a flight
I have the feds right now
Then have lunch with you
Lil Wayne: yes, no, elz talk to them
When planes collide
Hurricane Katrina victim in the building
Ok, soldier by day, rider by night
And who am I to try to keep hope alive?
When I see dead babies floating
Man, they want to want to transform the streets we grew up on
Uhh, tower 1 fell, tower 2 fell
Look up and pray to the one above you
What's up on my nigga
Yes, but in the belly of the beast
In the helicopter flying looking down reading signs
And, I've seen tragedy, I've looked him in the eye
Yeah holla five by four until they bury me man
Can you hear me
When the levees broke
You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers.
When the levees broke
What's up in my nigga, the same shit?
Now if I died before time, Lord
Because through us they live
So Katrina hit, and three days later, Fema just arrived.
Or until I'm high and drunk and my car strays off the road, ha
And if I die, I pray for my soul that you keep
And I don't want this world to kill me, but I'm weakening
What's up on my nigga
We keep our heads up after the disaster
Come and be my death volunteer "
But, 4 million, 5 million, 6 million: I am that now
You're on the floor, so get down, bitch
Money on my mind, gun by my side
I'm in the same ass block letting the bell ring
They don't need drugs, no penicillin and I'm the healer
Why would the quarterback give it to you?
I'm rocking like a big pimp
Mushroom bullets hit your body and then spread
Respect them or I'll put you on that highway to heaven
In fact, pussy, you'll have your own lane
Direct flow of Grand Patrón, there is no one to chase me
Four-four, bulldog, fuck you and bite your butt
How I got in that white-eyed Aston
It's black on chrome like Darren McFadden
Yeah and don't compare my loot with
Hey Hey hey!
This is just to clarify the fact that the boy is back! Oh!
If spring ever falls like a rubber band, I know what I'm saying
The police are watching, the streets are talking
Hoes is unfaithful, your family is not great
And I don't join niggas I don't love bitches just money and drugs nigga
I'm a damn man, so respect me as one or the technician knows your son
You want to be me and you don't even understand me
Say ah! Wizzle F Baby fa ya muhfuckin black collar
Y-M-C-M-B without autocorrect
I have a little circle, you never move
He's always been bankrupt, who's rich now?
Money talk nigga, I've never heard shit
Never put yourself, hell no, that's a no-no
Special I'm crushing you, something like Gallagher
Hitting your girl and then I'm gonna pass her
D5!
Nigga, we ain't worried about a thing (D5)
Bring it back, bring it back * record turns around *
Come on friend, you know how it goes
We are just a group of young black people with mass
Young black money
Please many ladies
So please say the, please say the
You only respect the fact that we're the niggas she chose
Listen princess
Then go to the mirror, I look into my eyes
I only remember the moments, call me Kodak
But it is your denial that I must hold against you
You deceived the son of God
But I forgive you
I love my niggas; not homo
I swear I hope everyone gets cheese like Digiorno
I hope Chopper City Records explodes
And me and Skip come back (Skip what!)
Because he is locked up and I am free
It's not difficult when you feel it
Tell the world that they are in danger
All of you for the feeling
All of you for the feeling
Tell the world that they are in danger
Even tell a stranger
Life is not fair, sorry for the feeling
Turn nothing into something
Tell the world that they are in danger
All of you for the feeling
All of you for the feeling
Because your eyes say everything
Two
He introduced me to Diana, fucking Diana with a little girl
And the E is for Ebony, that heavenly pussy
The F is for Felicia, the strange Felicia.
These are my bitches, my alphabet bitches
M is for Melanie, she likes my melodies.
I don't like my baby moms, she's so negative
Or is it for Olivia
And these are my bitches, my alphabet bitches
And the U is for Uma, the assumption of position
It's me, bitch; this shit like ABC, 123, bitch
S-R-Y for the W-A-I-T, bitch
She knows when I go, she's more than a fan
And no one is going to take it away from you, nothing is going to make you miss it
But she will never forget that (just one night [x2])
The next day another city, she will never come with me
Memories that she keeps forever
She got (just one night [x8])
These niggas hate the game, but they can't lock the tray.
And she goes home with him, he sicker than a patient.
Look, I can't be her man, and she can't be my girl
You only have one night [x4]
Yes
Santana see you haha
To get it out of her pussy, put it right in her ass
Since I was with Diamante with Diamonds in her vagiña
And for them niggas from Magnolia, she fucked them all up, Slim!
Speaking of Slim, the F is for fat
And the G for Gabrielle, you can call her Gabby
You have (oh), you have (oh)
H is for my friend in town H Heather
She never says "o" to me, the most she says is "Not here"
J for Joanessa, a little sexy with light eyes
Because she's super good, but she can't take that dick

She gets together with NeCole, whose fucking Olivia, well!

Whoa, I'm in love with that brother

And when they were leaving, she warned me
Lord I feel like Plies (I feel like), that's my little baby (Baby)
Amazing Amy, amazing Amy, my crazy bitch
That bitch will kill me, then she will be famous
That's so amazing
That bitch will kill me, that will be crazy
That crazy bitch, amazing Amy
And this I'm sorry 4 Waiting, Amy
My hook in the water, lil 'mom, she bit you
Waiting for Migos and Wayne to fall
She conspiring on me trying to get some money (cash)
Caucasian, black and Asian you are amazing
Take off! Take off!
(Nah) she's been waiting patiently
(Just wait, just wait, just wait)
And I'm so sorry for the wait, Amy ...
If he goes through a trial, I will miss every Christmas as always, forever
Amazing is love
Oooooo love
Feel like flowers in the morning after very bad weather
Why!
And know
Without suitcase without luggage
Going back like Aaliyah, I'm upset
His good love made me run back
Try to make a left turn, I have to go another route
But I make a U-turn now I'm back in front of your house
Amazing is love
The best DJ in the world (Yes)
I'm going to call this "Real Rap"
Because this rap is real, you know?
Light it up for them
I think we slandered, but we just got beeps
Grindin 'all day like we had sleep insomnia
Living like the videos, write a treatment about us
Trapped in the hood like they pour cement on us
The ghetto bird is still shitting us
The government keeps giving up on us
And that was my nigga, come back with my nigga
Fingerless, I'm exploding
This shit is harder than a bench press
But i will keep going
And that's why it's just a name in a song of mine
So much shit just sit in this mind of mine
Yes, and he fucks a man with a badge
5-0 killed Naudy, good dead boy
Man you would have thought they killed corn bread
Not to mention they were wearing street clothes.
I am ready to shoot like a camera.
Stand still motherfucker
I have to write my will this summer
Or my late grandmother, Miss Mercedes Carter
Or my grandfather, Larry Balsock
The old man hurried until his heart stopped
And all I know about my real Pops is that I had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag
Hopefully, but honestly
Greetings to my nigga Steveland! Rest in peace, pimp
Calm storm in the building
There's a couple of married bitches in the building - they get fucked!

Hello baby, let's make a porn!

Amen! Tell them kids alphabet is a "G" thing
I have a street sweeper ... do you need to clean your street?
Preach! Security violation
Nigga my money out of your reach
Just a way of life
I bought my mom a crib
Let them both meet Tune
Most rappers fall because they don't represent anything
I got a bitch so bad it makes a player nervous
I will pray for them, shorties, trynna, that they raise their dollars
Swag so dumb you probably think I'm trying
Like muthafuck all of you
Like muthafuck all of you
Come into my bitches ring, bitches ding ding
Fear God, fear us seriously
Betta "Let go of my ego!" with some breakfast on the table
And you are the target, oops!

But this gangsta doesn't die like O-Dogg
What did Reid lick?
Fuck me! Fuck me!
I separate your body with them hollow tip biologists
And I'm gonna hold it bitch, yeah, that crown fits
When you're in the water, watch the sharks
Young Carter without dental floss that was so raw ah

Uhahaha!

Music up please
One two Three...
Where the government is watching what you do and say
And you don't know anything about this
Ridin with the drug boy (I am, I am a drug boy with a guitar)
I'm on the way to the next city, riding with the drug boy
My ancestors were slaves in the United States.
I'm on the way to the next city, riding with the drug boy
Where my president is B-L-A-C-K
Turn me up
It's your boy- Weezy F. Baby, the "F" is for "fucked up"
It's just that when these fake dj's
They fuck themselves because they are like
Because if it was a hit, they wouldn't be turning it off
Hehe, so I appreciate all of you niggas

I'm looking at myself in the mirror
I'm crack rock fresh
She hasn't come back since
Ask dem hoes
MMM
I'm a beast, ask dem hoes
Bitch I'm a beast, ask hoes
Ho I'm a dog, ask them about me
It does not fit in my pocket
Hat aside

Like hoes to the point; To hold
New jeans, new everything
Call me Weezy F., bitch
I have a scope in the heat
We don't even have to meet
Ya bitch love me
Ho I'm a dog, ask dem hoes
She watches me shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
Because every time you try to tell me something, you open your mouth, I stick my tongue out
It was then when I said: "Work, work, work
And she made me run 100 times
Sometimes it feels so uncomfortable
She said why didn't you ask me; I said, "Damn it, I didn't think I had to."
Ooh, I like that shit
And she bites that lip, don't fight that dick, girl, girl
There is steam in the air, fog everywhere
Now she has one leg in the air, I'm pulling her hair
She says "Hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah" because I fuck her good
Man she got that job, job, job
So we don't talk so much
It's hot in Miami but you know I keep the best trip
Getting up to the side is suicide
I heard you have a crib in Virginia, in the sand. "
It's not you, you're not a black Robb Report
I don't wear them big chains not mo 'because they sting me
Leave my girl, take the enzo
Then jump that cute bitch like hello
Pull up on that new thang all smooth
Hello how are you mom?
And they say talk about money. Can you tell how i am
I have the Frank Mull and time will tell
Bitch rock star, like a nine inch nail
And she wants to be in the mix like a black-white baby
Weezy also knows which of the girls will want me
Then jump that cute bitch like hello
Hello how are you mom?
I'm very good, I'm very good
Pull up on that new thang all smooth
...cold
.223 that bitch gon 'bop (Bah)
Baby, it's dedicated to you
She said, "Can I go through Tunechi?"
Quickie in my roofless car, break a nut and honk your horn
Acting like some carnivores, after that we eat
I'm not trying to fool my baby and she knows me better
I said, more money, more Prada, and the more the better
I said, "And you will need two"
We never get cold, we're too hot for television, wait
His ex, he so mean, fast food for his vegetarian
No Fugazi CZ, all of you guys really PG, damn
She said I love you Twizzy, I said I love myself too
Lil Twist, drop a four, four, four
She said "Baby you're so crazy and I'm your crazy glue"
I never calm down, I'm too hot for television, wait
Don't I make it look good?
I could never go down
Too hot for television, yeah
Umm, yeah, it's going well these days. I am about to drop a new part. I don't even know if you know what a part is. But I'm about to drop a new part and you'll see the tricks I've learned. And uhh, when I learn some new ones, I'm not going to tell you what they are because if I drop another part, then I already told you what tricks I learned. You're going to be waiting to see those shits. So, you know, that's it. You meet a skater there
I play the Porsche, 918
I mean the Spyder, you don't know what I mean
Go ask your bitch, I bet she knows about Mr. G
So me and G swervin '
I keep the double R, Steve Kerr and I
Amen amen
We put some holes in them niggas, we play golf
A cushion room, I fuck in my bathroom
I'm high all day, I'm high all day, I'm in D'ussé
You all niggas know what time Flav is
I gave G the day off because the parking itself
And they land on your scalp
Mud-Muddy Cup, Muddy-Muddy-Muddy
We want to know who received the money
What do these niggas want to do?
These bitches bring luggage
Yeah then text that man to go fuck himself
So I'm deviating from them niggas
Black hoodie, black kitty to match
Yes, put it in your hat, and Blat!
I keep the standards high like the Canyon
I treat the Grammys like some medallions
I treat the grass like azaleas
You see what I mean, and that's why you look
Even the devil advised me to relax
I'm drinking that dream and smoking that gone
When you reach your peak we'll cut your arms off
Fuck what they think, man, these niggas don't know us
I'm at the front until the fight ends
Even the neighbors are going to feel the vibrations
Clean the gun with my towel
I'm in and outrageous, I'm ripping pages
And then you reformulate it, we stick to the invasions
Death is related, happy to have done it
Are you ready now
Yes i'm going in
Like the Energizer bunny with a battery
O pa-rum-pa-pum-pum, and I'm so young
The judge just a bitch, the jury sucks dick
Carter in the office, take notes when I'm talking
Telling you where to drop the money in the morning.
And look at you pussies pissing in your pants
And my gang goes to Saddam Hussein and launches missiles
I don't know karate, but after the brain, I'll kick you out
The club is like a grocery store, I only get a bitch
And when my roll fell, guess what I did next?
We chop and leave your back on the block
Give 'em hoes and watch the bitches go crazy
If heaven sent it now, she'll give a black hell later
I woke up to a white bitch under white sheets
I stick it directly into his retina (Pssh)
I feel like I slipped and fell on you
I have to be much more careful
I am not a human being and you are a humanitarian
Woke up to niggas that look like me, damn
Beep beep, beep beep, beep beeeeep (That's sick shit)
I've been trying too hard
Wow, wow, I'm a shooting star, yeah
To hide these two horns, damn
Now, be the only compass that I need
I lick her without a tracker, I pick her in a row
Hey, then where are you with that?
Because I can't do it alone, I need an assistant
Some of your friends are fine, sometimes I think you are all dykes
I put my glasses back on
"It is the one that takes you back to you
"It is the one that takes you back to you
David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
The grass is greener on the other side, I never make the grass.
Be a Dora, double R her, treat her like a Ford Explorer
I see no evil, no horror, my bitchy pink eyes, Kamora
David Yurman, Erick Sermon, Pee-wee Herman
Twizzy baby, these bitches swallow babies, talk nurseries
I tried to escape this cock and they quoted me, I had to clean
Move the rock like Russell Westbrook, triples twice the entire season, woah
Tina Turner, buy it furnished, eat Italian food, shop in Paris, drive a German
Tina Turner, buy it furnished, eat Italian food, shop in Paris, drive a German
Black Chyna, Black Mamba, baby mama, Lady Gaga
Hold on, Rihanna, hardball, Sinéad O'Connor, hm
Let's go!
We keep warm with that 504 shit (New Orleans)
Sell iron all the time, and you know it
Look, go back to the garage on the pig
You can't have me, but we can have a message (that's 3)
New Orleans, Louisiana, we love packing gats
Don't tempt me, I'll leave you bent in your Bentley
Yes, it's Ronny, back in the game.
Run tell me you heard me rapping crazy
Sell iron all the time, and you know it
(Mack Maine) Yeah Wayne said it rained on them (I did)
Like, there go 2000 ... (ballin)
Pay your cable bill and try to see the saints
This is a classic like the old school Hirachis.
I appear like a soda, I see that the can falls
You're fucking with the drum major, let me play the hymn
(* bang-bang *, * bang-bang *)
Then I blush and wipe my ass, gunslinger like it happens
I'm not in some other shit, bitch, I'm in some more shit
Call me Master J, bitch, I'm so wrong
Because we would both be Angelina and Brad'n
Shooting through the window of your new Aston
Get out, try to run, now your chest where the bullets crash
I'm never afraid, and I never care
So fuck what they're doing there, I'm doing it here
You're not like me, motherfucker, don't be extravagant
Being broke is a foreign language to me like Spanish
It is the blood bath of the slaughterhouse 504
One man gang, animal, cannibal
I'm aiming and spinning that bitch like Soulja Boy
When I die let me rest with clips
Rambo, I'm going out with my Sylvester shit, bang!
That should be off the bench
She knows what happens today
And she just posted the shit
Tell him i want him to travel
Tell him my arms get skinny
Rick the Ruler Ruler Clip, Polished
So we knock out every tooth you choose
And I can tell that he's lying, that's not a lie
It cost me an arm and a cock
Shopping at Marshall's and shit
In addition to a main account, with crazy amounts
Also, I drank on the road, now I'm hanging out
In addition to my principal in the city, and she came
They said it's not their style
25 million in a nice big mansion
That exorcist told me that my wife is possessive
Adderall just so we can be restless
We are fucking everything, all night, no breakfast
That's sick shit
Dedication 6 yes Lord
Ayo, it's Weezy motherfucker, easy on hate
Bitch, I'm in construction, you just decorate
I can't walk with weapons, I have a guy who has them
I'm ready for whoever the opponent is, nigga
I'm going hard like Rafael Nadal
I see big cheese, niggas blind mice
Still attached to the script, like Nicole Kidman
My words continue, like a teleprompter
And the red flag, like clown lips
How how him? Because the? Because i will be
Moving around the city like an I.V
Like I'm the shit because I'm the shit
And for my unborn, I'm trying to reason with you, so moms
If I'm not with her when you get here, it's already clear
I'm a pause every tear
Bluka Bluka to your face, closed coffin
When he talks, you know what comes out: barreltone
Yes, I have eyes on the sparrow.
I saddled up and got the damn battle
I entered this building with all these knocks
Fuck today, and fuck tonight!
I'm living my life like there's no tonight
I am not worried about you because I am feeling
And now my neck gets jealous and everything
And all I really care about is my bank ho
I met her at first base standing alone
I call her an oral genius, she gives me head sex
CHORUS
Then we told Mr. Third Base that we're going to
Now run around a base
And she's still eating
Now she makes me
She wants Lil Wayne in her face
Then I got to his face
And you know I'm going to drink that liquid that you can't see me saying
I met her at first base standing alone
Gangsta grillz
It's me and Spitta man
Gangsta Grillz, Mack Maine see you
Gangsta grillz
Very fast like Rick
Keep walking, piece by piece
(Gangsta Grillz)
I cook good crack in a pot in a pot in which I got mad
All blacks only talk about all politicians
With the wind against my back I defend in attack
Like I'm 4'6 ", left arm so stiff
I'm about to teach all my bitches that
I come back like an old man
And I'm playing what I say
The loudest mouth of the southern boy
I have a money clip but I like what for
And pulls her seven jeans down, she likes to fuck
I like dividends, could I give them
2005 YM motherfucker
Never trust anyone who can bleed for five days and live
Daddy used to look at me like "Who the hell is this baby?"
I am the son of Satan, I am the son of Satan, I am the son of Satan (I am the son of Satan)
I made the world go round, that's a turn
It has been quite a journey
I'm going to shoot the helicopter like a fisheye camera
Just don't start shooting, I don't feel like arguing
Swag go head to shoe (Yes)
The killers come after you, can you say, "Murder for hire?"
Daddy used to treat my mom like they never made a kid
I'm in every song that I turn on
So bright bust, it's burning
Your diamonds are not right, they are spinning
White cocaine as my lawyer
Fuck me wrong, get me out of my zone
And I'm going to throw the damn snow off your cone, my nigga
I hit the shit out of that black pussy-ass
And I'm going to throw the damn snow off your cone, my nigga
Man it sucks on this bitch
Look at Nina's cock, call that rough sex
Extra fruit nigga on the smoothie ass
Bitch-ass, ho-ass, ass-nigga pussy
We hit the shit out of that black ass-pussy
Hit the shit out of that black-ass pussy
And all these niggas that hate me, kiss my ass, kisses
I still burn money, my toast
Don't open your mouth, I'm a dentist, nigga
Hit the shit out of that black-ass pussy
Fuck me wrong, get me out of my zone
I'll give you a whole bottle in the face, nigga
Young money cash dipset byrdgang
I did it off Apple Street like it was 2300 Jackson Street
But I'll still cut you down and feed the poor
Homie gets in my face, so I'll show you 38s
Watch me skip the beats, benz bentleys and jags
They are the jewelry I wear and the shine of my wrist.
And she rocks her real hair, run your fingers through this shit
And that's my big brother, so don't try to play with me
Yes
So drunk
Blow A Socket I won't stop it
Get the shells and Nuthin less between
U said it's probably all funky
I swear I'll go to the head with all of you, bumpercar
I was in hell and I came back, and I came back well
Black diamonds killing them, black on black crime
Drink it all, I'm dead
So I throw some ice and burp when I'm done, uh
sorry
I heard you got that good, ready for takeoff
Uh, it's Martian and I come for everyone
In case you have cat life, uh
And you have not seen cleaner land, you have not seen the worst
Light that wood, in the shot, take off
Check
Or standing on a stove, sweating, heating a brick
And we keep the hustlin 'slick, and we have clips like bananas
It's Lil Wayne, nigga: bang and bang for triggas
Flood the fast av with quarters and halves, black
Can you smell me
Who wants to fight with them?
Look, we can sweep with them because it deepens with them
And when it comes to drugs, I'm on the street with them
Let my nine millimeters kill your villages
Give me the yay, or else I will put it in your slippers
Spinning the wheel in orange and teal Bentley drop
So I'm going to put that on and get in the truck and hit your block
When you see the bullets my Glock explodes, everyone will eat them
Wayne # 1 Hot Boy, hot as the sun, can you smell me?
Look, we can sweep with them because it deepens with them
And when it comes to drugs, I'm on the street with them
And when they spit, he licks her ass twice like 20 damn dice
I pack the tight clips in them Glocks and turn on your block
While your grandmother looks at Oprah, gather her and tie her
If you want a grudge, chances are slim like Ethiopia
If you want drugs, I have more flavors than Fruitopia
Recognize that it is real and nothing more than that
And when it comes to drugs, I'm on the street with them
Who wants to fight with them?
Who wants to crawl with them?
Man they never let me get on any dog
It's the Tunechi Jr. bitch!
Dad, let me go and bring them once, did you hear me?
Wait!
You know what? It's time for all of you niggas to feel
I drove you crazy for no reason
You know I'm a bloody beast, yeah I'm a bloody gross
If your grass is not mowed, take the mower
Birdman Jr. Junior! Fuck a dog, bitch, I have a cougar
Man these stinky pussies suck, no wonder why he was smelling tuna
Tearing apart all his moms, you could call me a motherfucker
Man, am I about to act like an idiot and this shit here? Just a little provocation
My chain freezes, call my shit under arrest
Damn, I'm just playing with the dog
I have a verse for anyone who wants to talk about the clique
Pick up calls from the boss like where we are
I'm the only one who does the job
I'm that nigga boy, they love me on the streets
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
I took a 223, two Michael Jordans, black
No duct tape, so when I pray I ignore black
Where are the real queens? Yells Capone and Noreaga
Diamonds on my Rollie face can't be exfoliated
It's not what you walk away from, it's what you walk away from
I must be doing something
She doesn't love me like she says she loves me
I had to get him out of the scam
Mothafuck the rest
At work and the bitch fell asleep
I'm the only one who does the job
Stick a couple of kilos to the bitch's stomach
I have the crocodile inside (think daddy)
Slugged in the front (think daddy)
Get up, I'm taking little birds out
Nigga, we are timin ', the cost of my surveillance on your house
I'm a boss man, I watch the south
(Chorus)
(Verse 2 - Lil 'Wayne)
You don't want to play with me, I touch you man
Losing your man in a fight, but you guys don't see me
I played with Martin, call me hustle, man
Oh, I towed many dull tullies, den broke many dun hoopties
Still pounding boots like hammers in tims
Weezy F., Weezy F., Weezy F., Weezy F. Baby
I just bought a plane, I'm about to take that bitch to L.A.
I'm so flying, I think I really fly stealthily
And I feel my belt, and I feel my sneaks
Louis V. shoes with Louis scarf
'About to', about to cum on your lady
Weezy F., Weezy F., Weezy F
Baby hahaha
But I feel my belt, I feel my sneaks because
East side!
You judge what you see in the mirror.
Yes come on you know me man
Watch a soccer game and bet everything on one move
I'm still harassing, baby, yeah I'm still flossing
You look a little salty, have a cold coffee
Although I am a boss and I have papers to fill
Swagger right, check, tight game
And they will tell me R-E-S-P-E-C-T me (Who?)
The best live rapper, the best live rapper
Swagger to the right, check, uh, tight game
Peel and go, kill and cry
No footprints, no plates, no face, no trace
Pete pistol, mammalian ammo, gunslinger, blum-blam!
Pussy niggas, go crazy, just call me ...
The best live rapper, the best live rapper
And you should be afraid, be very afraid
I'm on that money train and that Mac will get you out of the way
No problem, honey, so I got 'em
It's just a victory lap, honey, I'm just jogging
The best son of a bitch yet - Sorry for cursing (Who?)
The best live rapper, the best live rapper
The best live rapper, the best live rapper
The best live rapper, the best live rapper
Anything he can do could do better.
I have all the answers, so call me when why?
Where, who do you think you fly to?
Even if I didn't want to
Yes I'm an animal, listen to me growl
And they run with my words like I'm writing in jeans
Heaven in my plans
I swear that I am important as the evidence I say
I'm just trying to make my alphabets as heavy as possible
I receive accessories and any other additional credit I may
Why? Cause I'm just a standing boy
You only know me but God knows I try
Delayed flow, Special Olympics type
Young, champion, like a lamp I'm in
And no I'm not talking so don't blame
And if this camera shoots me, Lord, save my chains
Listen to that kanye again
And you don't have to call me the best mane
Young Moolah baby ...
And doesn't McCain look like his heart about to fail him?
Forget all my adversaries, inflate the baddest mary
Yes, Katrina made us catch an RV
You know I'm attracted, you attract attention slime
D-boy made them flip like a slime ninjas
Launch your demo, I don't even like your introduction, slime, haha
The crazy Droppa, the rest of you, are lame
Yeah look at your boy in the duffel bag
Reaching around the corner in that pure mint green
Hatian, turn it on, sak pass tou ka te te
Now what? It's my sound
(Now what?)
There is no one else like you
There is no one else like you
Fuck other niggas' cause I'm depressed by my niggas
I know some niggas who think it's Iraq
But let's say that's a thing of the past
But can you imagine the scene after that?
Sir I guess I'm just blinking too fast
Man, fuck with other niggas cause I'm depressed by my niggas
Keep that shit in your shit, or eat that shit, don't spit it out, rrr!
Keep my bad bitch up, keep my main bitch
Your need to make her look up, uh
That's not sauce, that's pudding, huh
Shooting the juries, damn
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Now your good luck looking like you're breaking mirrors
With an ass that shakes with a grip or tickle
And I take a triple, flip, kick, jiu-jitsu
And her man is simple, so I had to tangle her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a second, I'll go to your neck
Yes, cannibalism, becoming an animal in a land of civilians
The one who told me that sometimes
It makes me send text messages to all my enemies and tell them I don't need them
Turn your children into parent electors
Make your bitch a widow and your mother a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap, if you don't die I'll boo you
Niggas prostitution
Just follow the coupe, ho, and I know you know
The power to do it, my pockets is supreme
Mafia Nouveau, I'm the one
True black boss, should model for Hugo
Pow-pow-pow, sounds like a two-door symphony, or opera
Private flight, don't fly too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school stream
And umm, oh you know what I'm going to say Steph Curry, hehe, Steph Curry
I've been doing this shit, nigga, who are you?
Nigga, you don't know shit
They can't stop me
Even if they stopped me
You can get it tonight and all night
Look at me, bitch, look at me
Young money baby yeah we're here
I took her off the hood and put her on the hills
Yes, when I was 14 years old, I told my mom that we will see better days.
And indeed, we did exactly what I said
And when SportsCenter appears, everything stops
C3!
We hit every block and we hit all your men
I work every day and drink when I get up
To hold
I have a recipe
Tie my bitch to the bed frame
Fresh out of the womb, I knew I was a leader
Who keeps the score because I beat them
And I have really big wings
My wingspan as Yao Ming
I saw a mill at fifteen
I have no roofs
Finna falls asleep?
I spent a couple hundred thousand on it
I said you lied to me
She tells me it's my pussy
I say bitch, you just lied to me
And I have really big wings
I put a sip on everything
Vomit blood with my hands
Yes, life is a bitch, but I appreciate it, man.
Go; dark shadows i can't see your enemies
Dress like a skater, ride like Shaun White
Weezy fucks the world, yeah I fuck him till he ovulates
And if they want a war
Just let the melody breathe, yeah
Big crown, lil 'nigga, Bing James (Bing James)
Frozen bust, take a photo, freeze frame (cheese)

Sitting Spike Lee, (Yeah) I've been doing the right thing
Take my dirty money, (Yes) and teach him about hygiene
That banana blip, (blip) point it at the rapper's lip
This ain't shit, (oh no) let's wrap your ass and wrap it fast
Two twin Blickers, lil 'nigga, ying-yang (Huh, huh, huh)
Big crown, lil 'nigga, Bing James (Huh, huh)
When I'm on my wild shit, bodies on that blacktop (Yeah)
All we know is big B, yeah, you know, that's gang gang
Big crown, black, Bing James (missing)
Two twin Blickers, lil 'nigga, ying-yang
Yes, great game (great game)
We enter the room and she laughs foolishly smiling
I'm flipping this girl and I caught her slowly bending
I'm hitting your twist, this is my fool, you hear me
Biznite is your trippin
Than
He, he, what ...
No i'm not the father
No i'm not the father
Hell no, I'm not the father
Hell no, I'm not the father
She took thirty minutes to play me as a little coward
She said she started riding it on the parents of her baby Honda.
She wants him to change it and copy a new Mazda
I tried to touch her thigh, she moved my hand and said ah ah brother
Biznite what is your problem
Than ..
Biznite what is your problem
That
Biznite what is your problem
If your baby is born with braids, I'm not the father
No i'm not the father
She says "oo" it would be very nice and usually I would
I sneak running straight home, I won't be a fool
What have I have why?
No i'm not the father
Hell no, I'm not the father
Hell no, I'm not the father
If your baby comes out saying what ... I'm not the father
You will never be anything more than a biscuit
Hell no, I'm not the father
If your baby throws up "W", I'm not the nigga
HMMMMMMMM-
I'm crazy, I'm sick, not really
A bad pill, all of you sweeter than Advils
As I sit on your girlish bread as your last meal
I exploded before I grew up
I flow like I don't have a head, it doesn't matter
Drought
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Six nigga, Dedication 6, nigga
If we hit him, that oui is not French (not French)
I am antisocial, forgive my dyes (My dyes)
We're all wavy, I'm just on a different wavelength (Yeah)
I see them more like superstars, I'm more like Super Saiyans (Woo)
They try to build a wall, man, my dogs will hate that shit
Yeah we're in the game but we don't play that shit
Facts nigga, trill nigga, tax nigga, still nigga
Nigga, diamonds in my teeth, shining like some pearly whites
Speaking of a war, it's a convo at the bar, wait
Drugs in the Broncos, the fucking horse race begins
Some niggas have the right time, you ask, he says, "Time will tell."
Some niggas think they're icons, some bitches think I care
Lyin 'there, looking like "Aww yeah", lawn chair
What have you been working on in black?
And prolifically working on my album, you dig
You all are funny i'm crazy
If you can't bear the heat, get out of the kitchen
A life to live, never ask for a mulligan
The sun doesn't shine and the weapons don't sleep
I feel like a black republican, the drug money comes
Forget a tongue, she put a lung in it
We don't throw them away, we fire them, dig
You guys have to stand back in the mirror because you can't face yourself
Assholes
Blinded by the light
That I love you in general, like painting clothes
Don't forget that baby is what I tell the pilot
I did overtime, I took the duty of potatoes
I vent, and I don't show recession, money well spent
I never had a pop, so I never had to register
Get ten out, brrraatt, the chest is out
And I'm the type of dime
And I'm walking in the lime light, still like lime
I'm a rude boy, with me dreadlocks
What blood klot?
You don't know we call the Uzi the Oowap
I don't do cops, I don't wap
Amen, Hallelujah
Convertible, I don't make tops
Take a sip and take a pill when the hook drops
Dreadlock rasta, hair like paste
Tunechi rude boy, bad man listen to my shotta
I'm in a two-cup congregation with mud slides (pour)
The weapons clap so loud, they scare you on stage
Last week they ran to my house.
It's been fucking the world, now I want to hug myself
I fix your frown, leave my footprints on your floor stomping
I hate when my hoes come to town without warning
I have my own ups and downs
You little niggas don't do shit, but you make my stomach growl
Circling her pussy I don't fuck
Better buckle up and stay buckled
Take a sip and take a pill when the hook drops
Dreadlock rasta, hair like paste
Tunechi badman, rude boy, Imma shotta
Dreadlock rasta, hair like paste
Tunechi badman, rude boy, Imma shotta
No roofs
The world is made of keys, ounces, and pounds.
I have to cut it, chop it and cook it
And my butter J put me more 'd'
Now i'm going to ride because i got riding on my bloodline
Concrete bleeding
We put together his album, we're so gangsters
I am pumping or with a lot of hay
And oh, I'm just gonna buy a whole house
Just follow the street code
But just to be able to eat
And if you see me getting fat, I'm probably getting rich
Cause I did and I do shit that's better than new shit
I'm a beast, a dog, I see that money, I'm looking for it
Don't check me, go see your bitch
You don't want to get me out of my element
They don't want steam, but I know you want tea.
Is that your bitch? Why does she just fuck with me? Cause I'm playing, MSG (Ballin ')
Roof lost in this whip and I need two kitchens (two)
He won't catch me in any club unless my tool gets in (Ever)
The war is on, that bazooka rise is neutralized
Shoot five times five, see how you divide
Kick a black ass, then give him my shoes to shine
My niggas and the food are fried, the news is lies
They put on a nice costume, your boyfriend is blind
It's bloody mary if you fuck with me
Straight out of the hood, a young thug
Flip that
Discuss the mixed party
Change that from drug to coca, I'm exploding fast
(secret weapons) "I can hear myself but I can't feel myself, I want to feel like a tweet!"
Now my niggas are flying birds
Shit, we just live, we take money, we take baths
Now it's not so nasty
Fuck you, this is the other one
Then wake up the bitch
Breakfast in bed don't forget my english muffin
Dick millimeter dick back and murda
If my girl catches us both in place, she'll confuse us
Pussy niggas talking about all that carelessness, we'll be merk
And yet he understood us so when we told them to interrupt him
Because the gangstas don't speak a word, it will be a war
You niggas jus finalist
That's what they say when they touch me and listen to me on the radio
I'm a pimp for blood, not relationship, you'll be a hunter and I'll replace them
I am a damu blood, my relationship, affiliation, nation soo woo
That's what they tell me
That's what they tell me
Yes i put on my shades
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
And yes, things changed, but I'm still sitting across from them
Turn on that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limiter
I see them all dead meat, and I'm just a butcher
Beach bum, call me Ocean Drive Slim
Belly of the beast until he vomits us, motherfucker
I'm a blunt hit, polo drawers showing
True or false, correct or incorrect
Keep buying shit, keep fucking hoes
Father forgive them because they don't know who they push Lord
I'm just trying to dodge the shots they send to God
Now when you smile everyone should look from the side
And when we are hungry you look like a cake
And whatever you fight, we
You sleep in the field for trying the guy
And if I ask the boy at home, he'll eat your face, yes!
Yeah nigga, I'm telling you, I'll tell you again Shawty
You play hard and I'm gravel like dirt
Yeah nigga, you got some money, nigga
That's the only way
The street keeps calling I have to change my number
She goes beyond the law, shit we could crush tomorrow
Shit, look at marble in a certain light
Who is that? ...
The easy pair of Pradas, three quarters
Why do I feel that my Nikes are the whitest?
I'm sick like hepatitis, we appeal when we are extradited
And you ask why my bitch hung up?
Repo Man, faget you owe something
And I will tell you why you need to vote
I've been
I've been trapped underneath
They know I have that coconut
I'm never with po-po
And it's always low-low
And it's always for the bass-bass
I take care of the poor
I'm sipped, I'm slow [?]
I like when the bitches yell "Go, go, go"
And I maintain a low level of security
Trapped in my pole
Promethazine I go professional, yes I go professional
However, my bitch swallows cum and even bursts a bubble
I'm just like bis
Too much coke shakes the skill
Wake up in the morning, see a real face
Ben Franklin with the blue face
Weezy wrong, naw I'm really fine
All the white diamonds on the front of my teeth.
And I'm as New Orleans as a motherfucker
It's Young Money and we eat, get your own dinner
Make me go in the trunk, get that bone crusher
I have never been afraid, I am not afraid of anything
They like the way I play, they call me Hot Sauce
I have more clips than any movie you have seen
I stop you like I need a gray poupon
I have that heat, fire and warm
I have never been afraid, I am not afraid of anything
You listen to guns like boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
The lyrics of this song have not yet been released. Check back once the song has been released.
I have friends who died young and I miss them, tell the truth
I put diamonds on your face so that when they see me they see you
They invited me, but shit, I got a food ticket
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I did some things that I had to regret
The reaper took the soul of my friend, I feel that he follows me later, oh Lord
How I got out alive, sometimes I wonder
Because we've been going to war since Contra
I'm not used to showing that there is no love because we grew up in that hatred
He tried to rob me, he was smoked for a Rollie, time is up
It was young and cool, but they still smoked it in the wafer.
Feel this shit
I saw some things that I could never forget
The reaper took the soul of my friend, I feel that he follows me later, oh Lord
Oh yes yes
36-24-36
And girl I really need to know what's up
Damn baby you're a hottie
We are on another level now
Because I have a pile for you to lie on like a reclining chair
She in a new V playing with her new seat
You got a cold doll showing the new freeze
Shawty knows that she has a bad body
Shawty knows that she has a bad body
You have a body so bad I could put it on you
Girl that head so good I would have thought you were a genius
Shawty could you have the cover photo
Have you flown shining brighter than a shooting star?
And girl I really need to know what's up
Shawty knows that she has a bad body
Look at your sweetest little thing in the whole world
So don't say don't give me a chance
Shawty knows that she has a bad body
Damn baby you're a hottie
Coming to America as Prince Akeem
I never give a shit, but then I saw
And some pampering so you don't give a shit about the slammer
He's just trying to stay alive, grabbing his hammer
Er'yday wakes up, just vows to do his job
And it doesn't have a Twitter page, but you can follow it
I'm a dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher
Dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher
Dreaming of being the Huxtables, he settled for the Bradys
I caught my first case stealing cookies from ACME (man)
Gas cut, my clothes smelled like kerosene
Dreamcatcher, keep chasing
Dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher
I started thinking about things that I never had
How can you hate me where I come from?
You'd be surprised what niggas do as soon as fame comes
But now I'm getting to that, niggas act like they deserve it
I'm a dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher
And I got that four-door Aston Martin on the road
Black pussy, ahhhh! Back like I never left
Still walk in the building and go crazy with a hundred racks
Boy, I have your favorite singer really trying to fuck tonight (Ha!)
They think I signed up
Because I just bought a new Ferrari (new Ferrari)
And when I win a hundred, I'll buy a new Bugatti
I just called my friend and he says he licked
Where's the cash? Show me where you are hidden
Before I let out at 40 and leave that flat ass
Make a move and this muthafuckin mac squeezin '
I have a hundred killas on my team
I have the oo-wop. trying to get it for my mom
I have another lick, so I have another chrome
So I had to grind like this to shine like this
In the back of the truck with fists clenched at the wrists.
I have a shorty, she tries to bless me like I said, "Achoo"
I have foreign bitches driving, fucking, sucking and swallowing
I screwed up with Mariah
So I bought that new Ferrari, hates to rest in peace
Hate to rest in peace, rest in peace when parking
Double M, yes, that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm the lieutenant
Because my mom needs that money on the bill and my son needs some milk
You fuck, you fuck, you fuck, you smoke
Now I'm hanging that fallen head, I'm riding on Collins
I'm the same black Berks Street with diaper braids closing
The same nigga that appeared and I had to wait for my place
It made me feel like that silly boy when he first touched that brick
Are you ready? Uh uh
I used to pray for times like this, it rhymed like this
And the question of time I spent in shit locked up
From what we started, lil 'nigga, but I have the heart of a lion
Lil nigga, I'm on fire
Frozen like a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm a flyer
You're not talking about my niggas, so what are you talking about?
Gangs move quietly, nigga, and I don't talk much
Wait, wait a minute (minute), did you think it was over? (Whoa)
When I bought that Aston Martin, did you think it was rented? (Yes)
I'm the type that counts a million cash and then I work like I'm bankrupt
Because my mom needs that money on the bill, my son needs some milk
We're young niggas, mobbin '(Mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin '(Whoa)
This two-door Maybach with my seat reclined
If you're not about that murder game, then nigga the fuck, shut up!
With that Puma life on my feet like that little motor that I could
And I'm the king of my city because I still call them shots
Wait, broke nigga got rich (Rich), loves the game like Mitch
Half a milli last week
This motherfucking summer
Fucking all these bitches
Although it continues to explode
My man was reserved with a white stone
Talking jumping from Bentley, jumping on his bikes
Now it's Italian marble, moon walking like Mike doing
Peanut butter jelly on French toast, eating well
Gargle with champagne, everything is wonderful
Now I am, I have neighbors like in 3 states
Do it for the vine, I won't do it
So what you think I did, I went and got it
Back in the day, packing the K
Ay ay
Yes Yes
If you handcuff, you promise I won't do anything to you, say it
You cut from a different fabric, they don't make this material
When you said you need some more time, let yourself get a watch
And if that nigga starts acting he just hits my line instead
Food to think, not at all
You can't even buy a record for low (Oh)
You can't even buy a record for low (Oh)
Tell him to drop it, drop it, drop it and drop it
Stay on my word, I'll be 6 8
Tell him to drop it, drop it, drop it and drop it
I tell him to drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and drop it X 2
She is amazing, so delicious
Model after model, tell her to bring another model
I hit him I crushed them
I tell him to drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it and drop it
Drug money will buy you whatever you want
One hundred squares, I'll buy you whatever you want
And fifty bottles make a movie like Big Willy, yeah
I need a tractor trailer, I need coke in the back
Paradise in the sun, I'm talking about the drug money
Fish scales, I'll buy you whatever you want
A thousand bills ", I'll buy you whatever you want
I eat, shit, sleep and talk cake
I've been on that paper, they know they're all done
I will be turning corners in a Wraith 11
Riding shotty but I have a mac 11
I play NYC and call Karen
She's gonna blow it up for a real nigga
She is going to really blow it ...
I'm gonna fuck the bitch and then tell her to kick rocks
Young Swae Lee, I don't like my athlete
I'm a young black man but my doll and my money are old
Man, I don't hit with these fools, I don't play without hoes
And I didn't go out alone, I think maybe they know
Motivating the still hot hood in the burbs
He spoke directly to the system, they say his power in words
Fuck those niggas
I'm not really stumbling, we have arms like a centipede
Diamonds that shine like a camera, my whip sounds like a monster
Because all this blood dripping, 20 racks I Louboutin it
Mother and cabins, that's where they'll probably find us.
Fuck with a winner, minks in winter
Young nigga, lotta cash, bad bitch, lotta ass
Tell them I'm coming now, tell them I'm a common raccoon
I niggas hating, my niggas dancing
I'm like losing you bitch, losing you bitch
My bitch is patient, your bitch is boring
I fucked her up that Friday night
I have a rubber band in my pocket and I'm talking like this
Face down, ass up
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck
I got all these hoes trynna fuck
When it comes to hoes, man, I got you bitches like I got my town cause I run that shit
She comes trying to catch her breath, I grab her tissue like she's down
K.O.D I'm playing hard, it's me, Sneak and Breed ho
Her pussy good, my cock is golden
I got a nigga coming out of the bottom because I'm deep inside when I dove in
She doesn't even tell a nigga when, you're just gonna leave a drenched nigga
I say we should watch wassup and play, let's see who calls who (aha)
And now you're mad, saying that I treat you badly
Face down, ass up
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck
Look, you know what is crazy
30 degrees outside
Dealing with probation, everyone said I'll be back for sure
There's jack boys down
No man with the big bag, just a man with the big gat
He will show you
That love is there, there is no mother there
That shit made me hungry and now we get rich
And all these niggas get sick
Yes because i'm dancing
Fucking you good I got you bustin 'like you Rambo
We were in Miami, the first time I saw you
I was in the mix, acting like a savage
So anything you want, yeah, yeah, you can have it
That's why I play as a game when I pamper you
Hundreds of bands on me wherever I go
The diamonds that dance on my chain come from Joe
Many niggas hate but keep it low
I keep my bitch on Vera Wang, that's fa sho
I bought a Range just to drive it in the snow
When you appear like us, my nigga, there's nothing underneath
Fuck on the air mattress everything on the side
Dabbing like it's Cam tho
And the streets know my name, that's fa sho, sho
Richard Mille all flat as the airport
I just pop the perc so I don't feel the pain
And it'll be down when I get to the party
I'm on my eighth Rollie, niggas keep talking
Blow the damn money on these niggas
I'll be getting money fucking hoes
Many niggas hate but keep it low
We are selling dog food, I'm talking about that pedigree
Blowing fast money, blowing fast money
Blowing fast money, blowing fast money
If I hit your ho, I don't even feel it
Playing with bitches like Curry and we never miss them
Bust 'em down, fuck' em good, never kiss' em
Tell your daddy I said, "Fuck your feelings!"
Blowing fast money, blowing fast money
Fuck, be humble, fuck, be humble
How I feel today? I want to ride the Wraith
They gave my wishes nigga
When they told me I was locked up, I was in the cell
Because your pride won't leave you when you drown
So you hold it like a soldier that never folds
Let you breathe, I get a deal
Hundreds of real dolla rumblin 'attorneys
Shit, I was only five years old and angry, I couldn't shake
With your gat, no rappin lay on the ground
Smashes babies in the window looking for their mommy
Because where I'm from, we die young
Don't even bring a stretcher for him, bring a bed
They don't even touch her body
Respect that, and I'm a representative until D-I-E
I tell the truth, I make the niggas rewind it
I don't change the back block where I am
I cheat, I come back right away with no time to loosen
Know how the 40 claps sound like a mini mac
Being hit with all that, like I'm a flamer
Watch me do my thing
Me and Meek together that's kind of like a dream team
I just stop at that cream thing
And I got those 40 I'm not talking about no [?]
Look at my boys about that gun work
He hopes to run to the police and say something to the pigs.
Thirty-two in my Glock, I'm trying to bend something
I put my dawgs in money and on the map
You want to see me reaching out my hand, that boy is a rat
Because they watch and listen
I'm going to tell you a niggas scheme for that green paper
Now I'm getting this money, I feel like I'm going through a change
Money is not the root of all evil, your attention now
I don't know if the niggas have applauded me or are going to kill me
Before I lose my son's soccer practice
In summer
In summer
In summer
Started from the bottom, I remember I don't have a dollar
I bought my first Impala
They gave me some shit I wouldn't give my dog, man, that shit was the nastiest
Shit like that, turn the boy into a thug
In the cemetery it is the only stop
They go thugs and we post on the corner like a bus stop
Until we test the cell blocks
And your waters and your overdue bills
Because you got all wet and you went there because the little finished niggas killed you
Put these bitches on hold
Christian Loubs in his period causes his soles to bleed like a tampon
I begged God to buy a new Rollie
All flooded on my nigga wrist
See how I break the band, I could slide towards you and stop at A
Record it on video and record it
I park my whip at the downside, why is that?
I could make the Bently or the Rolls call the audible
Change but probably do the Rarri
Come to my city, we live like the mafia, and bitch I'm the head of the boat
Get up to my level and maybe we'll hear all that shit you're talking about
Mr. damn niggasbitches back
Give me those, Prada on tiptoe
Gucci by the catalog
Container number
Cash in my pocket I don't do the black card
I dance to the chicks and pack them, don't [?] At all
Gucci is all cinnamon
Slow down, she begs me not to go
Aye Kev
We shoot movies on all of you niggas
Right now, we just saw a quarter past two
40 you should clean them, soak them like a laundry
Graveyard, bitch, you worry, fuck off, you like the bitch you married
Nigga, you haven't heard, I'm talking about a word like dictionary shit
Banana Clip Peeler
Relics of snitches we don't play with revolvers
Ask for me! Questions about Philly
Name to appear, black: Meek Milly
Why the hell do you think I'm going so hard when I'm writing it?
It grinds me like a devil trying to get its fix
Try to tell black people to relax, don't pay the bills
But how did you go to pay the bills if you have a will?
Blink, turn, nigga brought you
Niggas will kill his own friends in some Nino shit
Hataz talking dirty about the boy we're not buying
See I'm zeemin trynna, I keep my semen, I'm not depressed with dhat
Lil crazy bitches dey want to have my baby because ben franklin's bank account maybe
Bitch in the cemetery you care, you like the bitch you married
I'm a BOSS, I tell the hoe to quit and get the business
Because I'm running this shit right now
Shoutout to differentiate everyone
Glock 10 with that laser, fuck you meet your creator
I passed 100 racks on my chain, they all know my name
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these niggas
360 waves, make that pussy wet
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these bitches
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these niggas
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these bitches
I'm not talking about La Hoya, but if it were, it would be Hopkins.
Diesel in the air we don't touch the Arizona
Looking like Corona or Homer
Demon Microphone, I'm serious
I get hard like taking Viagra before I get the beat
To get this change, another nigga in the chain
Never rats, never fold, niggas come up to you busting your gun
For all my niggas who died I wish I could go back years
And bring them back here
On the block running that rock like a ball yard
With blood pouring out of you and swimming right behind you
The streets have been the old head that raised me as a rider
Now this is for my trill niggas
And this is for my young blacks
I left you a little [?] I know I was wrong
So I show you love, dry your eyes, hold me
I know I'm sinning wrong but no one is perfect
Because I'm going to get you paradise, my little one doesn't have to grind
Because I'm going to do it for him I know he's looking at me
They live like hell Lil '[?] I couldn't tell
I give him what he wants, I make him think that everything is fine
I have to crawl before I walk, that's how the game goes
To get this change, another nigga in the chain
Never rats, never fold, niggas come up to you busting your gun
But everyone knows that the hood can be the worst distraction
And when a nigga disrespects you, your gun is your first reaction
And the only fun is seeing how I survive
And this is for my young blacks
Go find this nigga Bloodhoundz
And I just saw this paper turn my dog into an enemy
For the love of money, the love of the dough
I have to go to Panama, I don't want it chopped
The first to get the money, drop something, murder something
Fuck me, I could get you opp
For the love of money, they hoes fucking safe
It's about family, I do what I'm supposed to do
Be careful with what you say
You break it and you get a watch
We sigh, we grind and we are here
And I know, and I know
Who said that money is not everything?
I don't know anything that money can't buy.
All a black wants is a mouth and lip service
I have a stack for the monster show, I have a stack for the monster show
Throw the horses into my portions and the horse into my Ferrari like
Bust it ho, you have a boyfriend
Suck A Nigga Dick Ho Bitch
All I spit is fire like a dragon
When I had the rock, I used to give them glass
When you listen to the albums back
Because I'm swaggin hot new Js
Suck A Nigga Dick Ho
I have a stack for the monster show
All a black wants is a mouth and lip service
The bills have to be paid, the children have to eat
I call my calls nigga, I'm my own boss
Some niggas ride the bag make the wrong calls
To do the right thing, my money and my mind right
But this game I play is not a way to fix it, it is inevitable
I'm more real than these rappers, I have no competition
Hot cold summer nights we're still lurking
Squad, send a nigga home if he's nervous
He left it there [?] He lifted his soul up in the air
At the tip of a finger my man will take aim at the puncher
So if you owe me money, you'd better hurry it, you hear me?
My niggas quit the job and take it back, weigh that up
My niggas trying to turn 62 into Maybach
Continuing on my Facebook
'About to party, bitch, show her what to do
Motel, hell nah bitch, we better meet at the hotel
We fuck you bitch and it's a tragedy
My man said he should get up in that house halfway
You had to call a ho a dirty little bitch
Just take the ride, so when they stop you
I'm Roseing, chosen
Because I came from below, they told me to get them
Before I had no money, I was straight
Every time I see the cops sneak around the corner
They were tinted cars, I felt like I was a goner
I was there all night, BR had that hard white and that soft white
Me and Omelly in the car, on call flight
We take that job to your door nigga (uh knock knock)
A lot of niggas in shit, it has feminine forms
They come from nothing
I had my control over my forties, I was still on that stove
Talking dirty to these niggas with my Listerine
I'm talking about LIV Sunday blowing hella racks
Many niggas hate me now cause I feel
Seen some things that can't be told
They told me that these roads were pure as gold
I never said I never sold my soul
Niggas getting high, just to take the pain away
And everyone's not going out, it's a shame to say
I put my niggas on paper, we swarm like lions when they smell blood
They want my soul and my body for a little change.
I'm dancing with the Illuminati, call it Soul Train
Seen some things that can't be told
I can't be every role model black
Last night I forgot to pray for the shit I got today
My defense is like three fences and a brick wall.
I'm on guard playing point like Chris Paul
All my niggas go out to get it
And we'll never go back to the bottom
Who was talking when he was dead broken starving huh?
Ay Gutta, what are these niggas talking about?
I'm a rock star, crush my guitar
Meek and I don't dress the same, we hang out at Goyard
Trappin 'all night but I shine like it's Armor All
I'm with a different kind of niggas
You know how that froze, yeah
You know how that froze, yeah
She is so photogenic yeah
She rides my cock like a dirt bike
Wet pussy, Swiffer jet, come on that bigger jet
Meek and I still live together, we hang out at Goyard
Look at my neck, damn yeah
Look at my doll yeah
Look at my fist yeah
Meek Milly is back
And I just kill a full heartbeat like it's a heart attack
In my neighborhood I am an artifact
And I'll shit on niggas like a diaper
Know how I'm riding, if I can get Imma to share that
I have blood diamonds on my chain, just call me a southerner
Get money, get money and fuck bitches
See how I fall on this one, the best dog, that's my position
100 shots he spits, trust me, I won't miss them
He knows I went through it, you know this is how I do it
Get some money, you fucking bitches, try me, I'll show you this milly
Tied up with a mac on the back of the will
I could be slapped on the back for the parchment
Scream at the demons that owe us
You want the streets, no P, you don't want a drama boy
Get money, get money and fuck bitches
Don't fuck with me when my money is low
They can hate like I'm not upset about this shit
These niggas started hating, I guess that's what fame does
I started with a dollar and turned it into a million
Tell your bitch to suck a rich black cock
And the niggas said I changed, you probably would too
And I used to put it
And it's fourth quarter now we're going to D-up
It's the ball
This is where the game stops.
They niggas pussies, I catch them in the same place
When this time to catch that body that will say it wants to go
In fact, I don't mind putting those 40 on my belt
You like more regular burning in a forceful
All I really need is a little bird and a wheel
Quick sale quick four shit, hide in the door shit
Blood gang who we are, all of you niggas shit
Riding and burning, anything that's in the way
By blowing through it, it could die any day
But I travel either way, this is that crack music
We are not going to save you either
Wait, ha ha, selling that cocaine (white!)
The whole gang with me in some mob shit
They need a checkup (they need a checkup)
Fuck that checkup (fuck it)
Fuck that checkup (fuck it, fuck it)
Ha, yes
He likes: "Did you go out with that nigger again?"
Louis bag with hat, Uzi Vert with mac
All Hunnits, I don't want twenty
Stop hating, fuck nigga get money
Fuck your bitch, hit him once
My Rarri, there are no keys like vroom
Don't call my phone, don't leave any message
Better hit 911
Fuck that checkup (fuck it)
Fuck that checkup (fuck it, fuck it)
Fuck that checkup (Fuck that checkup)
I'm coming back (run, run, run)
Going HAM-o, exploiting cash, Bape camo with the masses
$ 20,000 when the tab hit
I fucked that bitch as soon as I met her (as soon as I met her)
Fuck that checkup (fuck it)
Fuck that checkup (Fuck that checkup)
Fuck that checkup (fuck it, fuck it)
So much money made him break the seams, boy
Think Benji at the door, take the helicopter, go get it.
Let it scream, we cook that hard crack, cement
Cause I've been working chasing money like I'm hurting
Roll the partition up
Everything in the cut is not like this broad, give a shit
Cause real niggas come first, that's why we're all out front
And suck it all in the back, and all of us tied
I spent a thousand on these shitty jeans
So much money made him break the seams, boy
What the fuck are you talking about boy? Fuck you mean boy?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about girl, it's two words, bitch shit
My rollie cost your house, my shows sold out
You can keep my old bitch cause I don't make the same hoes
The jeans in my closet add up to a Range Rover
Fuck you mean boy?
You got my old bitch, I brought my new bitch out of your dreams, boy
What the fuck are you talking about boy?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
Philly home if you get a benz niggas on the prowl
Lock me in the cell, let me tie my conversations
They are shocked, they write a whole book
I'm about twenty niggas talking about what cooks
The waves in the 360 make that pussy wet
She calls me daddy and I say "come here!"
I bottle pop, I model pop
It's Maybach, we're back
It's off the top ...
I know these fools don't like me, I'm probably exploding, ma'am
You would think they were all like us, they don't have my mind
And so my son has reason not to live my young life
Six by nine through these door panels, they make a lot of noise
I'm complaining on these city streets and blocks
My mind, body and soul and I'm traveling the hell road
Either way I go
You think I'm scared and here is your answer: hell no!
But when you go out looking for that cake, you must choose each crumb
I spent a thousand bucks on these fucking jeans
The note of your car in my jeans, my bloody sneaks like shit
She does it well and I will pay her for her service
Get pussy in my Maybach I think the driver heard us
Cause real niggas come first, that's why we're all out front
So much money made him break the seams, boy
What the fuck are you talking about boy?
I'm the leader of the ultimate mad assassination team
I hit it, holding my line, you better pick it up
There's no 360 deal this real shit, get all the money from my show
Fuck you mean boy
You got my old bitch, I brought my new bitch out of your dreams, boy
Fuck you mean boy
What the fuck are you talking about, what the fuck are you talking about
What the fuck are you talking about, what the fuck are you talking about
Cause these niggas rattin ', I'm not taking a chance
Homie said he fights that action and grabs me and takes a stand
I don't even shake his hand, I don't even smile
Niggas got fat while we were starving, they already ate
If he got the money we attacked him like a pit bull
You're not talking money to me, I need an interpreter
Boy what a feeling to be hit
Riding through the hood with ma lil bad white chick
Ralph lauren 7 jeans, shit 9 to 5 nights
I check you out like a fast mic, coming out of your damn mouth
I'm going crazy, we're turning, we're tied
Ma shooters, they don't play, they put you to bed like a wave
They hate every time I turn around
Being arrogant, I rejected it, now is the time, just go up
I look at these niggas and I can tell they're not one of us
I ride in the back like a nigga who can't ride the front of the bus
When you shine like I shine, you get additional enemies
"Wait, are these niggas serious?" Or maybe Meek Milly delusional
I'm done with one of you niggas, the paramedics were yelling, "Sure", about you niggas
Yeah we keep on playing, bitch it's the hunters
We gave them smoke
Fuck that shit, we gave them soap
They forgot that we gave them hope
I speak it, I pack it
You are doing shit on your Instagram
I have fifty reasons to say that you're taking cock
I'm in the 40s with the .40 on me like I should
I'm on my surfboard, that's what I worked for
Damn, clap
I got a bad bitch with me and a brand new semi that's still on my belt
She Pop Molly Pop That Pussy
When I wake up, the first thing I have in mind is to lift this cake
When I wake up, the first thing I have in mind is to lift this cake
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
Yes, we were completely wrong, but first we had to learn
Staying in my routine and stacking it directly
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
Thinking of my master plan
Trying to get a million dollars from half a man
Because I started to shine the same day that I got my right hiding place (uh)
When I wake up, the first thing I have in mind is to lift this cake
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
My Philly niggas (let's 'let's' let's get this money)
My niggas from New York (let's 'let's' let's get this money)
My Miami niggas (let's 'let's' let's get this money)

And all my niggas from Cali (let's 'let's' let's get this money)
A1 Rock Clothes (True)
Drive whips A1 (true)
I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what you thought
My new young girl looks exactly like Rihanna
So I kill a pussy, shit killer, homicide in shorty
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate nigga
Pray to God, I wash my hand but I'm damned
2012, 100 racks for Uncle Sam
Ballin 'like I'm balin', then I see Jordan in the mirror
About to float when I board that plane
And land inside the building
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
As if my PO found out that [?] I could go to jail for that shit
Paper paper in my mind, in my blow as I lie down
Going through the police block, it got as hot as Palestine
Up the hill, down the block we have rocks like an empty lot
Already the [?] Threw her pussy like the shit that her daughter sells
Get it in, flip it fast, I'll be getting killer catches
Never snitch, never rats
Getting money what I do, VIP let me through
Young and I get it, young and I get it
I'm just young and I don't give a shit
Shawty said she wants to roll and I'm like oh man she's fine
I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I copy four legs like yours, all blacks are not important
I'm just young and I get it, young and I get it
I just want the money, you guys can keep them bitches
Okay, your baby mom, I ball that, side girl, ball that
And I'm not crying out these hoes, I have these enemies hating everyone
You give him checks, I give him loot
She will tell me to get her hair done, he will return it to me
If she's not fucking Reef, then it must be Omelly
I'm like damn he loved that
Pussy being so fucking wet, I get up all over it
As fast as I get up there, I dart like a damn look
I hit so many hoes that I need a hitting stick
Prada in V neck two chains
Tell them to stop, look, Banshee on rock
I caught her at the club, my pocket was folded
How DJ Boo slows down your vibe
Because I send Osama to bomb your bitch
Scream My Nigga Dean Scream My Lean Nigga
It is in my nature to be a player
But you're not alright like diamonds in my jewelry
She thinks I'm shopping and dealing, she had too many boos
Or maybe I got a crap when I passed it to Skunk
Baby, it was fun and your son is going to run
You already know
And [?] And all my dawgs from the set
He just understands that he's going crazy every weekend
Me, Omelly and Meek at Four Seasons is on
Because when the blacks were eating they left me to do the dishes
I'm worth a couple million men that shit should be
If I could relive my life, I wouldn't do it any other way
Prolly brings my father back, just so he can witness me
Back in my area, I swear my enemies are history
In Killadelphia there were bodies falling like rain
Niggas killed, this shit is getting scarier
I left!
If you sell a million records or your block makes numbers
Do you dig
You dig, I'll get to that mule
Me and my bad bitch she look and look twice
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
So I'm on the road like a Buster bus
If it's not about the money, I don't even wanna scream
If you play or [?]
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
Made of matter let me say it one more time
I'm cool, move on the place with no v-neck jewelry
They want to play chess, so I put them to the test
Give me that uh-huh give me that
When she rides me I tell her to hit me
He ran it from me, I snatched it as if he were giving me back
Bitches would try to play with me
My future looked bleak
I try to destroy my dreams, I tell you difficult times
Never surrender
I hurried, grinds me hard
Put my faith in the Lord
I had to learn to be a man, learn to take my hands
Learn how to stack this money, work for two and feed the family
I'm 30 in my Glock, moving I'm squeezing
Inclined, addicted to money, I'm pretending
Shit, you wish you had seen her, I saw him at 23
Someone gets in the way of that, it's murder
I turned a damn quarter of an ounce into a condo
They leave you breathless boy
And I'm a little drunk, so I'm pouring out family businesses
Bitches faming 'my name
Life is just a dream for me
Relaxing on cool shit
A Southsider, product of my environment, leadbuster
I'm in the new coupe
Bitch, I'm on that shit, I talk that shit like an interlude
They can take a battery clip
Candy in the pot or in the package as if it were Fun Dip
I'm in that real shit, they're in that nutty shit
Please protect me from my enemies
Say Amen (Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen)
Check, check, check, check
Shining, shining, shining
Shining, shining, shining
She dirty, I love my person

We are in this bitch and we shine
Shining, shining, shining
Now we stop at foreigners
Cheat guys, don't touch
Shine shine
Shining, shining, shining
Back home, smoking legal (Legal)
I just broke it with a 10 piece dawg (10 piece dawg)
That's nothing, I'm just being friendly, friend
I just ... what? I just ... uh, I put a Richard on the card
Drizzy and I carry on, it's scary (back to back)
Known for keeping the baddest bitches in command (Salute)
There isn't a neighborhood in Philly that I can't go to (that's a Fendi)
I have Lori Harvey on my wish list (that's Lori)
You don't have to ask me when you see me, I know I'm tied up (Brrt)
I'm not growing up playing ball, but I'll show you how the hell you gotta do it
I'm still getting bad anyway
I didn't have to kill anyone
I didn't have to kill anyone
Damn, you mean this is really bad
The extended grip arrived, the armor with the ruga, easy and ruthless
Because I didn't have to kill anyone
Where the sure black points it out
I keep the feds busy
I can't stand these niggas, I'm about to fall
Selling all these bricks
Give them to my son and let him do all kinds of shit
I'm getting money, it must be the Illuminati
They think I signed up because I just bought a new Ferrari
Yes turn on the lights
These hoes are acting (Maybach) and these niggas are leaving them
These hoes are acting
Or better yet, like Rev and they
Real niggas in the building
They choose us, there are no other options
These hoes are working, these hoes are working
These hoes are working, these hoes are working
These hoes are acting, and these niggas are leaving them, yeah
Too tense, they won't open
These hoes are a damn joke
However, they will never say that a black man did not warn you
These hoes are acting and these niggas are leaving them
These niggas will leave them, these niggas will leave them
Big bread that we are accumulating
Cancel that bitch like Nino
Now these hoes are working
These 100-frame cars and more
Twenty thousand, all in hundreds
Fuck it, money, money, money
These hoes are acting and these niggas are leaving them
These hoes are acting, and these niggas are leaving them, yeah
And I never go anywhere without my gun
Looking for these boys to mess with these niggas
You already play hard, I challenge you
My niggas ride low
The same place where you put your hat, my niggas throw holes in there
I'm a dumb boy so the money in the shoe box
I play the night scene, hard rock pitching
So fuck the rap, I got a rap sheet
You just hit a body and you're still trying to kill
The last black tried that he was reserving those five
I wave a hand and my niggas bow their heads
I tell them to break a leg, I'm not talking, show biz
Me too, you too (I have to get it, I have to get it)
Me too, you too (I have to get it, I have to get it)
I'm in that new Camero every time I rush
All the niggas say I'm hot and all the hoes say I'm cool
Money is the motivation, listen to everything in my raps
I don't have to, I just let your girl
I don't give a damn what you heard from me
Bad bitches a lot of money know I live that
Watch them niggas throwing shadow
I have to get it I have to get it I have to get it I left
My [?] With you man, you are in a hellish position
You really have to understand your position.
You have a chance to really become one of the greatest billionaires to get out of town in this particular era
I got a price on your head, you don't give a shit (don't give a shit)
Hey, we don't talk, I'm just running for your shit
20 every day, I get money in power
They told me never let youngins get the dust
But now these niggas slip like they're fucking in the shower
I really do this, I'm 6'2 and with Ricky Ross
Yeah i took a loss i was in vegas
And the hammers were dirty because the niggas were trying to kill me
Fuck a bitch and let's go
Niggas and they argue raps, though they don't want drama
Your girl, my girl, my girl, your girl
All these damn bricks, I think we're going to need a forklift
Catch me in the hood, I'll be near like marriage
Murder at your record nigga I'm a serial
In the villa counting threshing, with shorty she vanilla
As for work, I make that fucking butter fly like caterpillars
Clip full of hollow heads, let me put some on you
What's going on
When windows open and their materials break
A nigga steals from me and we are going to kill his mother
My northern youth won't stop until your coffin falls
Hatching as time goes by
Fuck, lie down
Why should I emphasize that my check is in the bank?
Candy painted the black jelly bean
War will be on your doorstep causing mass hysteria
Ring Peedi at your mother's house
Walk him through with a dazzling shot, just like Travis Bess had
I'll run with the boyfriend and then I'll hit the best man
See I put it on my shine, I'll touch them all
Look at these niggas you know what it is with me
Philly in this bitch, I heard that
Rollie on my wrist brighter than my future is
I'm going hard on the damn paint nigga
I'm still the same nigga with the flow of thirty-six
They say it's a long tail to hell
But I get rich or die in jail
'96 Impala is sky blue
I have two baby moms and we don't talk often
My black Cass got the Bent, I need the 550
A couple of blacks were shot trying to take ours
Hate is my motivator
Low points, man, I've been there
Blacks who hate me, I approach them without fear
Shit, I'm not on it if it can't go on my mother's plate
I'm smiling in the face, even though I know they hate
Slowly grind to the top, but you're falling fast
And Tweety, he had to eat, he dressed Pradas like every day.
My mom lives in the neighborhood and they cut anyway
Those who hate are my motivator, they hate me, I challenge them
Can you hate me
Look, I have friends on the ground, skeleton and bones.
And niggas make life, they'll never come home
Just look at my life, rappin 'brought me back to life
In boiling water, in the world without order
Yeah i used to bust a lot of shit now i keep it moderate
These niggas know I've been freezing, jumping up shit
A good university, one of these black universities
We dream chasing, all of you niggas walking behind wishes
Just ask about the militia, they are malicious
So we could never be the same
Never bite the hand that will feed you
Some niggas need a headshot, some niggas need two
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some go to heaven, some go to hell
But nobody wants to lose, nobody wants to fail
I shit on these niggas like I'm the lottery
Who do you know fresh out of the neighborhood a Gallardo?
House up on the hill stupid crazy fool retard
Competition calling fast
I won't sleep until I'm rich (you heard me)
Scammers listen to this shit and then return it like it's the replay
Bitch I'm on my mule give me shit for your feelings
Watching the D dive in the Ford Taurus
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Uh, that bitch left me with a heavy heart
Fucking famous bitches and that pussy tastes like caviar
Feel this shit on all my verses
Nigga, you sank friendship, something you gotta live with
I always kept it real from the beginning (beginning)
Niggas plot everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Hunnit mill '
Niggas said they were with you when they really weren't (really they weren't)
I made a million, got a deal, got the whole team up
Remember that the nights were in the gram, toasting with the pilot
I gave this hustle all I have (which I have)
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas said they were with you when they really weren't (really they weren't)
And we roll up in that shit
I go harder than the hardest
I could give them Cavalli with diamonds on my body
I don't care so don't worry about me
Nigga [?] Stunted growth and balls, balls and stunted
Vest to protect the chest
I'll be throwing the thirty that rains a lot here
Nigga anywhere every block anywhere
Aston, sitting on the white of the 1920s as a napkin
8 ball, removing the scraping
When the moon falls, thugs pick up bought tools
I said halfway
So the order unit is going to take me back
I like to record on Philly
Put me in my zone
A thousand cockroaches, four mice
Yes, I remember there were no lights.
A thousand cockroaches, four mice
The shit I saw had no choice but to get me involved
Shit is towing, as she watches me grow
Right in front of the kids, she fucking her nose
The way we steal cars from them
Who thought we would go that far?
In fact, who thought we would live that long?
Because every fight I fought
Fuck you and take your life, nigga, repo
I'm changing gear in my rari
Lean like Kareem
My 750 my ray I'm clean shit you mean
They put me back in the trap
Fifty niggas mafia
Duckin 'them helicopters
They envy my album selling
Jealous I'm not dying
They are jealous, I don't know why
I guess I'm not meant to
Motherfuckers pussy
Whilly, now tell your favorite rapper that I'm trying to kill him, really
I'm leaving
Even with the jab I move with it, I'm well fried
I'm flogging in '62 and I'm not talking about crack
I was telling you how I'm going to move
Run this shit, it's just a relay
It's nothing you can tell us
This is not an important act like summer
It's Alumni, throw it two south
I thought it was a dream, but I never slept
About to go H • a • m all of you niggas just kosher
Oh bitch! They've been sleeping me
Only time we are 'Black and Yellow'
It's hate in the air, I don't feel love
Shorty is going to do anything, say she's a fan of rap
Get off the line, I'm going to show you what that MAC feels like
I am like Cibelli in the corner of a field
I don't have to say that I would
'About these bitches trying to fight me ...
Towel around my head
In my mom's mouth through the drama
Let Osama hold on
Win '' Lottery Ticket ''
And your girl, let me pop it in real life
'Beat' like I'm locked in a room
I feel like: put me in a field, let the field light up
Jack Black, blackjack, got the clue that Saran wrapped up
And it's T. Lanez, Ink, Meek and Los in this bitch ...
I, I get any instruments, I get a change in the mental
Money never grows like a fucking young Gary Cole-Man
Fire like it's five lighters, brighter than me lighter

She rides, tell her to jump (come on)
Slipping on that Impala
Meek Milly, the flow is flames
You don't want wife that
You are eating it and treating it, you see that it is I who did that
As soon as I'm done with it, you can get it back
So they assure niggas ready to die for you
All my niggas stop with .30s and shoot you
This summer I will have to beat my hittas
Check, check, check
My condolences for your losses, I just beg you to be fine
Steal me, I shoot them dead
I've seen people go upstate with wills
Black pussy softer than a pillow top mattress
You still don't send money to your man making an offer
It's not money, I'm not going
We are running this rap shit
We dance like the Lakers
Go hard for the money, like what you wouldn't do
Isn't it me, isn't it me?
Drama be the DJ
I know what we do is wrong
And Omelly keeps its shine
I'm not asking for any trips, I made it here alone
Come by the belt, by the ring
I don't even know these lame but nonetheless I like them like Jihad.
I'm not at my work?
My boys in black
Nigga runs her mouth and then nigga loses her cap
And when it starts to tear, niggas start to scrape
And dive in, hoping you don't get caught in your cookie

Nigga used to do the shit, now I'm the shit
Live now and die later

Yes, it is my ambition as a rider.
Rolling, joking, smoking, thinking how I got here
Celies with niggas who went to war with the strip?

Hold up hold up bump speed it up
Climb the chain before you see that flame
That fact is, I'm laughing at you across the range if you think you could get out of this frame
Since the tires and the fall have changed
A nigga wants it all that's wrong with it
More than a dream, we are the team to make money
Am I wrong because I want it all?

Young niggas totin 'glocks
We were Gucci, they were meandering
I really can't trust these niggas on this cash, and I can't sleep
Damn, I thought you were all here, I found out you weren't
It's a dog-eat-dog environment
When you stop them, I start shooting
All that drama that I'm made for
We've never been loved, so we don't know how it feels
I can not say anything more
Every time I'm in the neighborhood, I'm in a Wraith shit
In its streets, we are still there, blacks believe we made it
I feel like they're trying to use us, I can't do them any favors
Get it get it
Bad bitch good tits fat ass like really
Shorty blushes but it doesn't matter

Lying in an Aston, ten hoes in a mansion
Dream team! Here we go again! We do this!
Dip like blue cheese and count all the celery
Just to get my money back, try to get my hiding place back
All white Mazaradi, which looks like a laboratory rat.
And go and get it back
I say money, cash, hoes; that's all a black knows
Ok i have been working hard to get paper every day
I say money, cash, hoes; that's all a black knows
Peel off, then roll up
No. Phil, I was raised, South Philly, I play that.
Wherever it is, I hold it like a wave cap
Yeah my niggas stay tied, burn and I'm gonna fire back
Northside a Bird Streeter, Southside an Eight Baller
Posted by the green door, the cops come, we scrape them
Yes sir!
4th quarter, tie and one for the free kick
Come on, wherever you want, it's my ego
Interval jewelry, all I know is ballin
I'm trying to buy them TIP hammers I had, niggas at the mall
Don't you hate a black rapper who screams he doesn't have rap?
Spitting all that shit you spit, (tsk) I gotta catch
You've never been there, bitch, why are you performing in Hollywood?
We hit that Flamerz 3, we turn them off and on
Somewhere on an island like Gillagen
Doll clothes, looks like it's made of Jack & Jill and 'em
My niggas wylin ', we'll be wylin', wylin 'wylin'
She never fucks a rich black man
Just to flex that nigga with some real killers

But I won't fight without a pussy
You can bet some bitches call them leeches
Young wylin 'niggas, at 12 o'clock on a Friday
Because the siddidad of my hoes with the fat ass and the tits
And set my niggas free in jails, locked themselves in the system
Ever since Pistol Pete, my nigga, was killed, I resorted to a threat
Double drink my murky problem, I am a citizen of Actavis
Give nine milli shoot ten shots where you face
And the bills roll like an auction
Niggas is fading, I'm holding on to that tight thing
At a 7-4 pound pound, with the windows down
Like 20 on my neck, I feel like the king, no crown
Red porshe, red lights
Sliding through your area
Seriously, the numbers on my check seem to be a series
I said that an enemy disrespected me, so I'm transmitting them
2 40s give a sucka 80 as Shockey

But I'm DC reppin, Grand Hustle the muscle
No i don't love these girls i just love when i fuck them
A bean my nigga, if you need it I'll get it for you
Those oh-yous put them on a higher plain like Al Green
We catch them when they slip, they kill them
Young loke, and gun smoke, and choke done, and nigga
Bred by rat cockroaches, the real young cocaine
They claim they gave my man life, the feds gave my man 10
Mess with this dirty game, I feel like I'm at a dead end

Omelly out and let her out on the Mac
Like you don't want trouble
We come with them choppas
Hurry black muscle, save every penny
My boy Oskee, my boy Oskee
Wait wait
As if you were to live again, grow up like a child again
Pray that God is faithful
However if it was great I lost it I laughed
Shit, I'm just living at the speed of light
Ballin hard to see the light
Free all the way from the state. Man, when you go out here, man, all my boys who are reserved, man, when you go out here, do it
Your thing man
Front and back
That's Meek Milli and those boys.
Verserchy, without delay, I meant Versace
North Philly nigga, but I'm laid back

Call your dog, I call my friend and he will buy a little bird
Okay, I limp around and speak with an insult
John Doe and all Sean Doe, and I keep it G

Lawyer writing the deep deals
Dead Pres, who do you dig up?
Who's that nigga you hate but can't get enough of?

You should say goodbye to the gangsta talk because you're fake, dog
Me and Meek in Maybach, we take Wale and we take off
Get a dream buyer, we dance hard like the Lakers
You're playing, you're a faker, you're catching the fumes
I'm in your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor
You think Khloe doesn't know me, I'm in the car running hating
What does she do?
Thinking when I touch I'm going to fuck hoes and feed them well
Old school like Ice Cube bubblicious and some dick
Speaking of what they want to eat
My team was screwed
Because when I'm in the studio I try to make a movie ho
These rappers are so mad at me
Because they are not equal to half of me
But on the south side, where you find me
This from where niggas grimey on
My big birghtalin bird ?? shiny black
That shit you talk we found out it was a lie
They don't want to leave when I come
Fuck it, then it's fuck now
I've been that nigga in the corner, diaper braids and selling hard
Now I stop with them, I write "Oh my God"
Condoms all in my condo
Pocket change for what you signed?
Shirtless, baking soda standing in the sink
Snow White, no spikes, two batteries for my magnifying glasses
You're a fool for your wife and I passed it on to my crew
My dog is a shooter, please don't send me that nigga
They tried to swallow me whole, God be my witness
So I don't pay attention to the comments and all the mentions
I was washing dishes until my rags became riches
When your bank account twenty thousand 'and your house on a hill
And your family in the driveway, you go out and see the grill
Put my face in the dirt
You can break my body
Aim my targets and I'm going to shoot the arrow
Play your part, you have some brains like the scarecrow
Put my face in the dirt
Still, I get up to get the crown back, yeah
While I lie down (while I lie down) I lie down to sleep (to sleep)
Pray to the Lord (Pray) my soul to keep (Soul to keep)
Please God take care of me (Take care of me)
Pray to the Lord (Pray) my soul to keep (My soul to keep)
The fallen, (the fallen) rest in peace (R.I.P.)
I live inside the trap
And bitches prepare a nigga for a murder date
Drinking that sizzle, talking to a slizzurp
Connected on these streets like a fucking kizzurp
You run into that izzurp, say it then
B-H we're still one eight, don't play that shit
If that weapon attacks me, I'll have you a
I put my joint to heaven
My man will crawl over them
My friend is like my army
I'm on my beat like Stella when she got it back
Because I break bricks and throw shells like Mario
Try to make fun of me, I'm going to bury you
Family or not, like a rock Ima handle you
Man I'm lost here, this can't be life
They die every day, bullets fly every way
Dishing rocks, leaving the cops just to get through the storm
Because that's all i know

Niggas selling that white from China
Limo is my Rolly
And the black of Rozay D-Wade
Hammers and the fucking vogues
Made me the person you see standing here
Yes
Detention and suspension were always, when high school was the hallways
And we were all bankrupt, that's when the law broke
But I don't let it stop you know I will come back again
All the mistakes I've made, problems I've been on
Please, oh yes, believe me
I have a minute to say what I want, trying to do everything I've done wrong
But that made me who I am, and if I broke your heart, well, I'm sorry again
But I don't let it stop you know I will come back again
All the mistakes I've made, problems I've been on
Made me the person you see standing here
Thinking when I was in the trap
Niggas say I change, ask what I think of that
New girl in my room, old girl next to me
Fish scale for all my equipment
I'm surrounded by these dollars
Fish scale for all my equipment
She says they don't like them, brothers
Real life
I went from lint in my pockets to using money machines
I exploited my city again and they don't want me to leave
Daddy gotta eat, niggas shooting around my mom
When certain niggas starve, know the gun will shine
It doesn't dig me where I come from, we just bury it
Diamonds on my neck shining like a shooting star
Stop me little but I'm arrogant
Probably in the hills of Cali
In a million dollar crib eating strip and broccoli
I told her I had a deal so now she drove me like sloppy
Uh, I said my neck like "bling"
These niggas tease me and steal my style
I'm about to get a Bugatti, these niggas like "How?"
Money hitting, who is it?
Cause bitches don't come with money
Niggas looks funny

Running like I know they'll come for me
Moses black, Moses, woah now
Where they serve their moms
In front of his lordship, begging for freedom
If freedom was released, why isn't it free then?
Like "take it or leave it, leave it or take it"
If I could live twice, I would do it again
Who is going to love your mom with those drugs?
I was exploding when I had the money
This is real shit, nigga, not a verse
I locked my brothers in the cage
Moses black, Moses, woah now

Then we cook them and let them dry
We break it down and let it fly
Time to get it
Right here where I'm sitting
I'm double digit
A couple of million on the sofa
Right here where I'm sitting
Because when it comes to beef, I put bread on my burger
Send your friend a message just to get an idea
We are in the cemetery, where all the bodies found
They make the ride bounce
Ah

Time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
Right here where I'm sitting
Release my lil nigga
Like Tony the tiger, when he has flakes
Because when those niggas come to kill me, no one will save me

It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
Fish flakes when sealed in the wrapped rental
Little nigga, you're not doing stunts, pay that rent back, oh

We text each other when we're out of town
These other women are pretending
Untouchable, unshakable
Yuugh, I drop every blue moon
I still wish on a star
Grills as interior gauze
The soft roof is open, I cross the coke
Blunt by 600, blunt by 600
Untouchable, unshakable
Blunt by 600, blunt by 600
A quarter of a million a year and that doesn't bounce
I'm on the score for these movies, I'm losing count
Mu, you've known me from 1,300 ounces
I could show you the strange fruit
It looks like Beirut
These kilos are killers of drought, I flooded Jesus, I made use
Uh, the drop-top specialist
You changed right before my eyes, you chose the wrong flower
Go through the front door
Boy, now that things have changed, don't let me see you begging
It is a difficult life lesson to learn, when it is me you are not receiving
So low but you're alone and now you have no power
Why are you taking me, why are you taking me?
Go through the front door
I don't know what you think I'm looking for
Bye, see you later
Why are you taking me, why are you taking me?
To all the hustlas with the same interest.
The bricks fell, I skip jail, I live to tell the tale
I am what dreams are made of
I am what dreams are made of
Nothing matches the feeling of pulling that new toy
The bricks fell, I skip jail, I live to tell the tale
I am what dreams are made of
I am what dreams are made of
I'm in the top five and all of them Dylan
I am hope, drug dealers won

Entrepreneur, connoisseur of the strip club
Hot chocolate ice cream, pour it on you, hallelujah
And I'm on my own cock, there's not much room for you, ah
Red, white, blue, I swear allegiance to life on the street.
All day I dream of sex, three stripes
We're the kind of crew to cool off just to sit in the living room
I have a bad bitch in my pool
We're the kind of crew to cool off just to sit in the living room
They said to be everything you can be
One on my arm, that's decoration
To the top climbing, raising
I just want to buy another Rollie
Up to your knees in this drug money
Even if you have money, you still look for more
Without Js, I'm still looking to score
If there is no child left, how can we leave him?
You can't relate because you weren't there
No, you were not hot, let me clarify
This is life for fasting

Who can't go to school like a J. Cole?
(But you will face anything)
(When the void is filled)
When love is real, you can do anything.
Make them walk like their 30s are just around the corner
Always thinking big now praying for the fall
Cook it every time you come
Because I hit the ground running away from the birds that I flew
Let's say you tell me, you told them friends about me
Cook it every time you come
Cook it every time you come

There's a meaning for the ring kisses
Do it my way, I hit the road with the dough
RG3 nigga, be that
Nevermind Nevermind
I don't care what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
He will sit and cut your lines as if he has not heard of you.
I saw it before, that man will kill you
Like a ghetto girl in good stitched armor
And you new niggas can't get through
I clear the way to wealth but I can't pave them
Skins against blouses, you are the prince
Chappelle Show, all of you Neal Brennans
Booty does not match sweaters
Three racks just spent on my Marty McFly's
Now I'm back to the future, my career leaves you
When muthafuckers thought I would barely survive
On tiptoe but all while cloning
She walks like her, but everyone knows it
Just breathing, I never wish to be famous
Put Trey on your hook, I still couldn't save them
I am the only one to send you, Bonjour
Skins vs blouses, you are the prince
The talk does not match the leather.
These Margiela verses all of you, inhabitants of shopping centers
Coffins for the orphans of my old bitches
Play the Fendi cube like a shark fin
And as we bow our heads at night, rich, rich
Yo, Young, Jeezy, Jizzle, Snowman (amen, amen)
We gotta give the streets what they want, man (amen)
Dollars make sense, I'm trying to get paid
So some will be trapped, some will be dying, bow our heads and pray
In your fall, sitting there, waiting?
So tell me what they will really tell you
I need the ice, I need the lights, uhh
See the first thing they roll and their bills they can't pay.
Saleen, yeah, that's a Mustang
They say they want that silly shit, well this is ignorant
Amen, amen, amen, amen.
Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Anonymous drug dealers
How many Madonnas can that Mazda fit?
Hat trick under my mattress
The date I stopped still has an asterisk after
As I wash my sins like a Catholic
Who the hell doesn't master this?
Life is a bitch
From A to Z in your shoe collection, choose
You thought I would miss my blessing
Bitch I've been brackin 'since the' 80s
Who deserves the medal of freedom is my accountant
The IRS should have surrounded the houses
We have storefronts, employee receipts
Bling bling
Mules move the drums, take them to different places.
I'm a course in miracles with this shit
Life made me ambidextrous
Counting on my right, white whip with my left wrist
Ayo French
You know I'm in that life, right?
Pusha!
Because all that glitters is not gold
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's going on
I'm getting low, hold me from the enemies
For every broken brick one stepped on
For every bitch I showed the way, it's one that stayed
When you look in the mirror
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's going on
Because all that glitters is not gold
When we take individual motors and turn them into Boeings
Loss of a lot of niggas, some at Club Fed
Better to know who you are
I'm getting low, hold me from the enemies
Rolling smoke, high, high, high
Broken heart, yours doesn't look like ours
Throwing that flag running around you, hot shit
We who judge juggling with mallets
So you will never be my neighbor
Smile as you greet but we know your niggas hate us
Don't be afraid get everything you came for
Little do you know we don't miss the shit
The meat will make you pray to God
Guaranteed to be in ICU once again
I'm going to the ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I came out unscathed from the days of my treatment
Still in my boy, smelling like a kilo
He prefers to burn on the tables in Las Vegas
More than my earnings, we can share opinions
Like the small steps, we can share the beginnings.
Walk before running, but she's so independent
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
It seems that the haters never take a night off
I'm going to the ball like I'm seven feet tall
But I'm soft, white and smooth like my Pinot
Feeling so if he knows how we know
He prefers to burn on the tables in Las Vegas
Under bright lights
In a perfect world
I'm going to the ball like I'm seven feet tall
Shop till you drop
We can share opinions
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I feel
It seems that the haters never take a night off
This is my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
Now I'm looking at the hand of a dream
You can call me a smoker like that
In a perfect world
Just my guns and my girl
But you know I tell them they can get lost
I am disgusted
‘Because this week looks like last week
They were both called Ashley
Now they ask about the function
I hope you bet on the sleeper
Now they ask about the function
Drug money kicked like it's FIFA
One more cup and I could take off
I don't know about you, but I'm going to get off, because I'm feeling
The driver of that car was a?
Feeling so if he knows how we know
Buy until you fall, they say sharing is loving
And I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
Play my cards right, now I'm looking at a dream hand
No joker sees it, you can call me a smoker like that
They think they know
Oscar de la Renta (and)
My nachos - big bell
Trend marker
Landowner
You little niggas - you Hyundaii
Half gold we have a hand
And this time
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
I should start a new life
And I'm starting a new life
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Last night I thought if this should end
Me and my girls will go out tonight
300 K thanks to digital scales
Touch your girl, mom, ask her what it sounds like
As God is my witness, my fist clenched this
And I'm starting a new life, we're hanging
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Flow plays limbo courtesy of Timbo
Strip black Jim Joe
Damn, I got my boys covered
Burial 2,000 in the Cayman Islands, they can't touch it
Damn, I got my boys covered
Don't you realize it's a candle until I blow it out
Drop a shoe, start a Play Cloths or two
Still a black unwrapping bricks
Connect is in Panama, in bed with cruise lines
Dis dude ah shit happens every day
Yes that's my flocka
Rent-a-cars for the whole month, drop Porsche money, not co-sign
Give a shit to what you sell, that opportunity comes, I take mine
We see a bitch, you fall in love, I go back because my bitch goes out with her
Sell drugs, go diamond in my block
She be suitable
Yes that's my flocka
Because rappers found all the ways to ruin Pateks
I'm too weird among all this pink hair, ooh!
Where there are no brake pedals on
That's where the kings go, in Santo Domingo
This for sneaker hoarders and coca snufflers
Because that's where the kings go, in Santo Domingo
Pusha knows that this policy is a paradox
It's flesh and blood until it's cool as shit
That's where the kings go, in Santo Domingo
Now this is how the ting goes, back from Santo Domingo
Mike WiLL Made-It
The same rappers who speak next year will be the drivers of Uber (Fuck 'em)
Trap door buyer, turn the wall
330 laps, cook a steak on this grill
Me and I, we like a hamster on the wheel
With a questionable pen so the feeling isn't real
I can paint the picture with the words if you listen (shh)
You niggas sold records, never sold drugs
But I am a thinker, methodical in my motives.
Neither woman, nor child, nor witness, nor Jehovah.
Scoring from above but I wanted my purest
Descendants of kings, we're on it again
Two weeks later I had to be that carrier boy
Windex cleanses me for life later
Four chains, large studs, one black also flies
Chasing my newspaper, I couldn't understand my wealth
Follow the codes, there is no love for these hoes
Launch a gang cartel, dare you do something about it?
Fuck with the foams, when you take the house
I have you, my nigga, wait
Neither woman, nor child, nor witness, nor Jehovah.
No i have nothing in common with you
They are tipping the scales for these cookies to win
Just give me the crown, I'm active again
I was pissing my shorts with rich black thoughts
Copy a kilo and have people on top of your house
Hoping to land her ass on the top 5 lists
I wish you niggas alright, you niggas wish I failed
My drug network is a multi-million dollar crime wave
Get this money back, counterclockwise
Small bubble in the cut like peroxide
I beg your pardon sir, hoping to get more
Have mercy on me, they curse me
My name is my name coming soon
Saying hi to the rude boy, I'm saying hi boy
These ain't the same kind of hitting, boy
That was ten years ago, if you know it, you know it (Yes)
This thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours
(If you know, you know)
And you and your team are the caravan
Two bad hoes in two-piece bikinis
The skybox is right next to RiRi
We have tennis balls for the wrong sport
If you know about the garage
That's the reason why we play
If you know you know
A fraternity of drug dealers echoing
Too legitimate, they still look at me with one eye
But a trapper-turned-rapper can transform into a Puff
I have only admired Sosa
A stop like a Walmart
If you know about the garage
The hatch is supposed to be uncomfortable
Circle twice for bis
Ever hit you with the weight of the water
I've been granting wishes like a genius
Two bad hoes in two-piece bikinis
Only responsible for showing rappers how to stand
(If you know, you know)
Circle around twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)
I earned my name just like Marlo
Red light, yellow light, green light, go
The bitch keeps on whistling, magic snake charmers
Missin 'dope money sends chills down my spine
Made me feel like Hov in that Lexus bubble
Yes!
At the mercy of a game where the codes are missing
So I don't tap tap for cookies and sing to mommy
Ferrari, my 40, put out the candles
He sees what I see when you see Wayne on tour
Shit, I've been exposed, I took the crack and built the cable
Your rap songs are testing my patience
But let's all play together
We all know what niggas really have been waiting for
Yeah yeah
Infrared, yes, you know what I mean?
That Louie and my cologne when I travel in that Lambo
Lakers - Heat, camera seats
Ah you can get clips
White seats in that Countach
Have you ever seen a Countach?
Damn, damn, I just crashed it
A bird's eye view made me channel my vision
Her pussy gets wet as she walks through my morgue
My music for your soul, inspiration for your life
The same graduation that was clapping on the rafters
The truth hurts every time it is revealed
Villain as Candyman, say my name and I'll appear
When he plays mike, everyone haffi puddung a run weh
That's the energy that I miss
A thousand drug dealers with the cruelest intentions
I'm Kobe going for his sixth ring, as the church choir sings
But none of you niggas rhyme from the 80s and 90s
And the bad bitches were wrong to drop the moms
It is the anger of the caine
My name is my name!
My name is my name!
To do it you need more than talent, more than hustle
And niggas with their hands on the white like blackboards
I'm on a crash course
Like a god among men
I rinsed off the drug money, I already paid for my sins
Books and lawyers, I already paid for my friends
Wear your little jewelry, you could floss when you're dead
Tim and I, it's coming, it will kill them
Now we are breaking new ground
King push nigga!
He informed Pablito pa 'bajo, but I'm still here, and the other guy? He is running, but I'm still here, I don't even know why you're doing this crazy thing, I don't know what, but I'm always here. You want to be like them, right? you don't like them ... And they definitely don't like us
Don't go crazy with me, okay?
It's like an itch that you can't scratch
I still want
Learn from OGs, Alpha Romeos and Sterling
Sitting with the women of your dreams and forgetting her name
Federals listening to conversations through my own star
Every day a nigger dies we can't ask why
Tony Montana, tailored suits at church
It is as if he threw stones at the corral begging for the rich man
I still want to sell kilos
Richest man,?, Remarkable moment
Bithces loves my environment
He blew out a fuse and caught a body
It's like an itch that you can't scratch
Pulling on the sheepskin, necklaces above, bottles above
Updated that, updated that
Blue suffocation, in the inner potato sack
Looking for the fish scale like I'm trying to find Nemo
That is what happens when Michael
And they try to treat you like Tito
I still want to sell kilos
Joining puzzles to solve I's homicides
Tony Montana, tailored suits at church
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work
Look at my face on the news and it's not Tivo'd
Looking for the fish scale like I'm trying to find Nemo
I still want to sell kilos
Bell Biv DeVoe, pushes poison like a copper head
Bottles of rose wine for champions
It's like an itch that you can't scratch
Federals who listen to conversations through my OnStar
Tony Montana, tailored suits at church
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable moment
A thousand keys that I'm about to do Pilates on
Candy covered parked, doors ajar, in a stripper, blew out a fuse and caught a body
Now crawl for him
Court! 80,000 on this niggas watch
Damn Batman holy toledo
Kings hold court
Bounce on niggas, I lived it nine
I'm living a lie, she lives for this life
Loving the rush, I'm living "The Wire" Uh
Drugs and this rap is really "Empire"
The real nigga of the marathon in RICO
Damn Batman holy toledo
Big said, "Only the feds should fear."
Yeah shoot shit and then we blow up the scene
And spend it all until I'm swallowing earth
'On that bread, I drop a coffin on it
Luckily there was something on the ceiling, keep dealing with you
We were born to mothers who could not deal with us.
Let's hold it tight, tear off the plastic
Without excuses, without respect, tread the brick like a walk
Twenty thousand in phone cards
We were selling birds at the port of time
My first Grammy was my first brick
I rap, nigga, over cheating niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!
But he has never been an infantryman
I rap, nigga, over cheating niggas, I don't sing hooks, ah!
Father knows best, wash my hands, everything is forgiven
Grant, Jackson, there's no place for George
Eliminate fools who scream imitation ice
My music is for your soul, inspiration for your life
Help my young bitch see her way through her singles
The truth hurts every time it is revealed
No weapon forged against me will prosper
They all fall for the love of dancing
Face it, Jerome has more time than Brandon
And tell me it's random
I need more drinks and less lights.
He said "take off your glasses and go into the pool"
And what is a black Beatle anyway, a cockroach?
I guess that's why they keep me sitting on a damn coach
Trying different jokes is no longer fun
I'm going after whoever. Who has it?
That you, this is how you
I forgot two things, my black balls
Uh, look, uh uh
The creation of this man, I let you see how much taller I am
But goodbye, I blew my own dice before I threw them
Tryna snatched my niggas from me, blew a small fortune
This is my time, this is my time
This pole position, I made a lane because they blocked ours
Call me "daddy" of a complex
When they turn you on, and the letters are big
But it's my fault, my sidewalk details
For eleven years we saw better years
They name falling onto caine copping
Anger against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
I rap nigga over niggas cheating
I don't sing hooks
But Instagram photos show more than side views
As long as you and I know we only fuck
You have that thing that will make a girl feel drugged
Just say the words, I'll do what you want
Hi mom, come fuck with the shotta
Don't listen to your best friend, she doesn't matter
Chanel or Celine, however I see you
You know I play fair, I'm Daddy Day Care
Oh I say boy, you got me alone
Let's get over the nonsense and be honest
Everyone I sponsored cleanses my conscience
And hug the kid like my bracelets did
Uh, I'm from the era where money comes fast
And I'm down at night
Said she's down at night
I'm down on my line
Look at my situation, I couldn't ask for more
Look what that kilo sent me, that Porsche is key less input
That girl is drugged and drunk, I swear the rest is elemental
Look at that shit that I park, I make your neck break and
I'm lost in the world, I've been depressed all my life
Down at night
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Why buying Rolex is more exciting
Kingpins back home from Howard
When the niggas shoot us every day?
This is crime by design
What I'm cooking in the kitchen, niggas
Bobby Brown, new edition, niggas
What I'm wearing in this blizzard, nigga
Saint Laurent, I'm in all layers
What is the price of success?
911 costs 211
Look like the sky of a jeweler
This is crime by design
Creep on these niggas
You'd rather be more famous than rich
"Paid in full" was more than reading a script
You ask me, Tyga seems like a genius
Gil Scott-Heron to the black poem
Woo, the revolution will be televised
Rolex crowns, enhance your wrist
Diamond crosses, portraits of Takashi hang
Street millionaires rub their shoulders
Check out this air hole technology and get my message
Two years later admitting it, all those niggas are renting shit
Wooo, rap fans were fooled
Chess moves on your chessboard, king he
Yes these are gunmen and goyard
Talk about these niggas
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
I was dead when that dust came
This big face is on Blu-Ray
Hidden 'choppas in the closet, half a million on the roof
I'm haunted by horror stories, I want to be homeowners
Drugs with Donatella, Versace mi a cappella
Never see me at Neiman's, niggas committing treason
I have this, I have that, I have I have this
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
How we still fuck the same hoes
Then hang it like a clothesline
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Millions, millions on the roof
Millions, millions on the roof
Choppers, choppers in the closet
This shit is cooked hard, right?
Call my ghost the Holy Ghost
Pop a tags when I'm paranoid
I used to touch my fingers until I found a fortune
Fast forward, oops! They say they want to see evidence
Dope boys, golden mind
Then put it on that blue flame
Then hang to dry as clothesline
Million-million on the roof
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Yuugh, I'm tired, nigga and you all have to pay your tithes, nigga
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This great face is in blu-ray and these black diamonds like boondocks
I'm crying saying your name, ride on all my niggas
Never see me at Neiman's, niggas committing treason
Preferred soft moccasin, frost, organic grass.
Blacks think they sit on top, just pose
Your blows are simple blows, they see through
Don't you know it's money on bitches?
Shout out my nigga Don C, aka Givenchy Don C
You can act like you don't listen to this shit, man
If it's about that, there's nothing else to do
I couldn't hold it one, thirty-two percent (Mhmm)
The police put you on a leash, nigga, you're a bitch
Ridin 'with three K's and I'm not talking about the Klan (No Klan)
Ridin 'with three K's and I'm not talking about the Klan (No Klan)
This is not an arcade, nigga, so stop playing (Play, nigga)
It's time to eat, my niggas and me buffing (we won)
They are in the middle of your life, nigga
Like blood diamonds, it's rebellious shit
Spraying niggas, now the Lord got them, rrrah!
Give your ass that body work, nigga, we spray (spray)
It's time to eat, my niggas and me buffing (we won)
Police, cook, collector, black
You were never a threat, nigga
Just limousine service, niggas stretch
Tied up like a cowboy
Stand up like that Yao boy
I have a bad bitch and she is 5'4 "
This is not an arcade, nigga, so stop playing (stop playing)
It's time to eat, my niggas and me buffing (we won)
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Shout out to my lawyer all the crazy shit I did
Give your ass that body work, nigga, we spray (we spray)
I swear it's like a disease
That goes round and round and round like sirens
I woke up and I really had it all
Even I was a victim of that, your pride won't let you do it
Addiction, both you and me, now take a seat.
Every car has a fleet, every width has a jeep
New bitch I've been fucking could start a rap war
You niggas pussy not quite
Yes, I see your vision, fed up with visits to the prison.
We can't judge you because we can't hold you
We send you to other bells and we let the niggas fuck you
Until we saw them strange cars stop
Dig them deeper to stay, knowing you deserve it
Real bitches are worth it
You niggas pussy after all
I had a dream, I had it all
I woke up and I really had it all
I've been looking at all of you real niggas
I've seen more niggas than you niggas
Strike, snatch a chain
I am in the club, you are also in the club
Pushing bitches to Instagram
I do it for money of a quarter of a ki, really
You niggas pussy not quite
I woke up and I really had it all
I can't bother paying tribute to the ancestors
We don't cry for the dead black, we pour bottles
It started with similar powder in a bottle
Gator in my mom's house, welcome to the zombie land
Below 40 but a streak will make you fit at night
I wasn't stunned, I kept my poker face
When you get to heaven's door, they won't have room
If you go numb like meat on a smoker's face
The second coming is in the second verse
They say I'm warming up, welcome to the flame, nigga
No matter the success, it's still the same nigga
Able to drop everything at 30 and be free to leave
Just deal with divas who need to know
And what you need to know is when should you go
You can hear in each bar and each cadence
Last supper for you niggas now repainted
They know better, they know better
He won a gold medal.
And a gold bezel
Now you're so jealous
Freak Hoes, I have several
Clean my nigga section, no flex nigga
Cross the border like I've lost a daughter
He chooses and chooses where the bullets fly
Still killing the haters, God bless you
The brighter your star becomes
To corner the market
I have the Tec and the team that comes for you
I'm calling the shots, you're calling the police
This thing of skill (yes), this thing is ours (yes)
Look when you play with God
Uh, so every day I go hard
No, no, I don't regret it, ahhh ...
I got a call from my jail niggas, I said I was doing my thing
Foreign cars on a freight train for every nigga they railroading
I've been in that same boat, I won't let go of this chain
At the club drinking P&J on the same arm as my Piaget (Woo!)
Yeah i'm on the move i can't look back (no way)
Screaming: "No regrets, no regrets"
Real nigga and all my real niggas niggas
Trying to be fresh as forces, I swear they're white as new
Yes, we want finer things, plus a plug on the scale
Yes, those plates that sparkle like diamond rings on the back, can't you tell?
Yeah i'm on the move i can't look back (no way)
It came from making real figures (too much money)
My teething ring was numb from the nonsense
Gem Star penknife and a plate
Black Ferris Bueller, cutting school with her jewelry on
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Once you delegate your bills, who's going to screw your bitch better?
Nigga, this is Simon says, Simon, red
"You better change, ch-ch-change"
A thousand grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
He said, "Son, how come you think you are my connection?"
I said, "Pops, your butt is washed, with all due respect."
I was born in '87, my grandfather is a legend
"Th-Th-Th-Th-Must be on whose cock?"
(Good!) Do you feel good?
King Push, King Bolt, Overlord
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Difficult to wield this double-edged sword
Either I'm rappin 'or I'm rappin' a bitch
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Mix drugs and show money, Biggs Burke on tour
I see faults, cracks in your diamond
CB4 when you rhyme, Simon simple
Every car driven was decided by the horse
It is a different face that you are showing
It's another "welcome back"
Tell me why
Bring money, fame for you
Standing on it like a pedestal
Aston Martin, DBS, James Bond great as James Todd
The best black to hit and run from A-Rod
My Diors is distraught, CDG vest with Jays in
Now that he's said something, don't make me have to die anything
My eyes down, I keep 5 rolled for my THC to produce sound effects
Three something for an after party and Balenciaga, I filled Arenas twice
And delete your words, G double O-D, MMG we're fine
I have Zamunda skins, I don't know how Akeem, but Pusha is semi cold
My nigga Geezy in VA, I hope you hear these streams
It is clear that I realized
I can't imagine it being like that, so jealous
Only you can say
Only you can say it
I can't imagine it being like that, so jealous
Bring money, fame for you
Standing on it like a pedestal
Bloggers follow your trail, 500 horses run
Coca-Cola ties, that Coca-Cola dries, cements, bakes
That's right, what's up Pusha T, it's DMV for life
It is a different face that you are showing
Only you can say it, tell me why
Only you can say
I'm a super black, my watch rocks inside
The middle finger goes to the coppers
The middle finger goes to the coppers
Like, oooh
A crazy motherfucker, maybe I should be my stepfather (Come here, son)
In the Interscope office with a handful of pedophiles.
... No one is in the oven
As long as you and I know we only fuck
"Open your-"
"Open your eyes, look at the sky and look
They say I'm the best, shit, I'm just trying to be
Without internal vision, however, they have their eyes closed
Confidential informants in disguise like us
The same principles you must adhere to
Lohans get the breaks, the T.I., we just guide them
They released Weezy
I'm just doing my thing
Because I did, I felt too much pain
Standing in the rain
I never did anything
But that's the bitch you're blind for
I never feel pain
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, move a bunch of gold chains
Yuugh! This is the brilliance of the drug dealer
But my tribe does not seek love
And a team of lawyers to lead the train in a judge.
But instead, I chose Avon
I never feel pain
Because I did, I felt too much pain
Blood flowing through my veins
Bitch that ain't paper, that shit fits in my pockets
These Balenciagas, Philip Lim, the runners
See how these watches hold these diamonds hostage
We the glasses, the acrobats, the jugglers
Do you want to do, do you want to do, do you want to make cakes, cakes?
If I want to do
Versace bed and 12 thousand on my king coil. (God)
It's a lifestyle when you can't live without it (Haaaaa)
Wild world of Balmain and Balenciagas
This deep rooted made gangsters
Now you break the bread and we break lobsters. (Push)
If you love me please don't judge me
If you want to blame, then look at the puppeteer
Who is going to block sleep?
Who is going to stop the shame?
Walking the tightrope, it's not a lifeboat (No)
My hands are tied, the power is above me)
This thing of ours is not broken
What is understood is not spoken
Do not judge me
Family, fortune, envy, jealousy.
The feds take pictures like it's GQ
This Avianne clavicle is transparent
Hidin 'is the only fight here, Push
Just keep your lips closed, the zipper, the zipper stuck
Summer-
I love that flow
I buy you some new tits, I get you that pinch
Just lift your lips, close your lips, bitch
I'm sick shit, I like quick shit
I buy you some new tits, just keep your lips, mhm, mhm
A new family started, the made condom slipped
Standing on the shoulders of twenty thousand demons.
Combination of locks to the kilo that I have
From my high school love to fucking with hoes
Nigga, not much has changed; in fact things are the same
I am the definition of marksman, weapon of choice, the Ruger
Nigga, surprise, 50 back on fire
The AK is an animal, it is fierce.
A nigga wants to sing, I hope he's the baddest
Innocent faces with a bunch of priors
Pirellis on the street rolling like a steamroller
Double team bitches when I have my sleepovers
This is a themed music tailored to the drug dealer
The AK is an animal, it is fierce.
Ring, ring, a nigger won't sing
Ring, ring, a nigger won't sing
They both fucked the same bitch, just not the same night
You just took his phone number
Another bitch, ménage
Lipstick on my neck, Oscar de la Renta (y)
Breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire
Trend marker, landowner
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
Half gold, we have a hand on it
Drug Lord, they put me above Lord
Mink was like Eight-Five with the blonde streak
Lebron is in them, the Coupe's Bond in them
I am pushing pounds; it's a cake
Every bird has my claws on
Flow of the witch doctor, you could say I'm cursed for it
Push!
Now that you're focused
Play in paradise
Bitches love shopping, levitating the mall
Who are you? We don't know you
And I promise, I hardly see you
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Coming live from Abu Dhabi
Noah on the tables
That made me hide it in the mattress, now I went around the atlas
Convertible convertible, falling on the roller coaster
Christian Louboutin, straps are like a case
No corpus, no guts, no glory, no jokes
All-Star we play
Representing all my niggas, I know I shared from the heart
Just chains, hello haters
Crew members turned traitors
New catalog will hurt you
Go ahead, it's dark as the curfew
Yeah king push on the way yeah
Blue moon, I pass, yes, but I faced every gram
Real money is not shy, don't expose it and get a tan
King push in the pharmacy
Mister father, I don't want to be a nuisance
It's not okay, but it's white and it's okay
A cowboy man, shy speed limit
I lost 100 grand the last time we shipped it
It's not okay, but it's white and it's okay
While I get this dough
Mister father, I don't want to be a nuisance
So I think it's time for us to toast
You've been holding my shit too long
Baby I have a plan
Run away from my baby
...I go crazy
run away as fast as you can
Man I'm about to go crazy
run away as fast as you can
Could you go or live with it
And I always find, yes, I always find something wrong
So I think it's time for us to toast
Baby I have a plan
Run away as fast as you can
I am a stone's throw from the streets.
I am not different from the priest, priest
They say death comes three by three, how appropriate ('appropriate)
Rottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock scream
The three of you are too accessible
Santeria!
Ha-ah, the angels will wait for you
Ha-ah, the angels will wait for you
It's the fire that I—
I am not different from the priest, priest
I just placed orders and dropped dollars
Seen all the wrong moves, looking at the untouchables
We don't make vegetables, niggas lay flat
Santeria!
After a long time, good afternoon
I bet when we draw blood you niggas will draw a blank
And all the praise, no prison can save
Hey it's probably better like this
Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Let's talk about this payola (Payola)
Sacred stories from home, go
It is the Mamman Shata code.
Something only we know
Something only we know
Darken my door, they told me the day was gone
Scared money doesn't make money
Scared money, they don't make enough
You want to go to war, you don't earn enough
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS RIGHT IS? GIVE ME ALL (BOOM!)
They don't want that kind of meat, so they want to squash it
Scared money doesn't make money
(We are never going to break)
(As long as this Mexican limits here ...)
If I ever go bankrupt, I'll take your money
Scared money wins nothing
And I was German engineering with my brake drums
I stayed awake for three nights, with a little demon fixed
The cunning one of the bad bitches with good heads who cheat
Sell it all black, then we dance black
Panamera's and us playing leap frog in em
If you get what you earn, we belong in em
Goonie shoot your wheel, you need May gold money
Extend my hands towards you
Changing the culture, they say I stain
Lil 'Pusha T, my synergy saved lives
And the mines on the road couldn't wait to say it in the song
I don't question the love of God, because every good and perfect gift is from above
Yeah ughh
Heavy is the head wearing the crown
Bring the noise (Bring the noise)
Get em!
Get the money and complain, bring the prize home (Yes)
Cunningly escaped through the hole
They kick my name until they bury me (never)
Push!
An icy black while I'm freezing the bezel
I only talk money, I pamper you, niggas
Street niggas star of the longest trap named mostly
All watches are overhauled
They say the snake is the closest, remember to cut the grass
I'm sorry nigga I'm trying to get home
Now when the phone starts clicking, your words start to echo
Oh my nigga, say it's not like that
We used to steal dirt bikes, dodge raindrops
Niggas so close thought we had the same pops
Hearing whispers, "It's not adding"
Telling all your cellies how come I'm not sitting next to you
I'm sorry nigga I'm trying to get home
It's like I heard you smile when you heard that they hit the wall
I'm sorry nigga I'm trying to get home
But, sorry, nigga, I'm trying to get home, hey!
He covered his own tracks, he didn't care
Every move we ever made is staring
She keeps a 16 on, a network of typewriters
Fuck selling the pipers to get the baby diapers
Benz trucker, all your men want to fuck her
She also cleaned a nigger, do you need a damper?
Everything you know, if it's my hands, it's cake hands
Charcuteries
New jewelers
Nice with visas, passports are art
Who do you think showed you that Chanel made the socks?
New body parts, bend D (you know how I do it)
Her mother says it should be a nurse hurts
Because the man is locked up but still tied you up?
And you know I need it twice, so take two
Fendi cross-body, blue beige belt bag (Nigga)
I'm supplying the beats
Weaker niggas shooting shots, I'm just leaning through them (blap)
Take a look at my life as I walk it (My jeans are heavy)
Cat corner penthouse as I watch him in the park (We scatter Big Boy Rise, nigga)
While I burn all this money, I didn't think about it (What are you looking at?)
Move Heavy D (drug boy shit); I should go for it
I just want to turn it around
I just want to sell it
A black got rich from what you snort through a straw (we supply the block)
Hate is so thick you can cut it with a saw
Q-dog steppa, Stomp The Yard best
It's so obvious in my clothes that you can smell it
Dope man, dope man
Around the crack of dawn
Jivon she motorcycle leathers
Hussein goes through these bitches, so I'm done with them
I get up early in the morning
And ... a little more, hit my truck
Everything was fine just make a key
Still moving snow like it's 3 underneath
Chi plug city has jukin 'city
Sit them on a sidewalk when you're done with them
I pick it up, right?
She says to me: Oh, I thought I had seen you before
We are not partners, we are not equal
One of the few who can really brag, post-glory
A nigga still plays chess on your ladies' ass
One horse on the grill, the other on the shield.
Balance on the scale, I'm not a Libra either
Grim Reaper, he cheaper, hemp chiefer
I've been more real, pound sign, been threshing
And they practice with bitches that break codes
Weekly cover of Hip Hop and a Rolling Stoner
Don't make us the same because we share one or two bitches
As if I couldn't see the scenes you reflect on your idol
Oh! Suicide, it's suicide
Story of the sheep and the wolves I love
Fifty in the liquor, without wrapping them
Unpacked, the dust rises and falls like Sebastian
Crab ride, turn back, tanner than my black skin
Oh how the day can be so long
America, you need a miracle
You have to see what Chief Keef sees
I say hello sun
I have no gear in me, I can't turn the other cheek
Be put on ours
Metal detectors is where ours is
They call the National Guard
From shore to shore, oh lord
Oh how the day can be so long
Oh how the day can be so long
The only thing missing is Seven Dwarfs
Fun snow white sprayed through my repertoire
They hope it will level me
I only talk money, I pamper you, niggas
You can't limit the protocol, don't turn off the engines because niggas motifs are on
Lil jon (HEY!) Snoop Dogg (UH-HUH!)

Put it up in the air, listen to the drum
E'rybody on, but I'm going to catch you (GO!)
We get on your hoes, all here turnt

Shorty you got burned, little mom, what does she do?
OA-KAYYY!
I've been listening to the radio lately
But you drink, take your coats and roll with me
But enough of me, let's talk about all of you
Tom and Jerry? Shaggy or Scooby?
Groovy, you can use me and abuse me
And we can do the hoochy coochy in my jacuzzi
Would you like to come and join me?
Man this really sucks
A black pimp like me to try
So proceed with speed
So you can have what you want
Are you in the mood for Marvin Gay?
Wait notice, wherever we go
We set it on fire first
The one we don't act like
You said you can't have enough
Tell Santa what you want for Christmas
And what else?
And I want three hours for the holidays
Many gifts for the seasons
Naughty or nice, party tonight
Boss, that's for tay tay
I write it in the sky very readable
This is not the season for wedding bells
This is the season for you
3 hours for vacation
I have a partner on my feet
There is only one simple rule
Baby, baby can't you see
I'm just great (great!)
What is that spell? (COLD)
Dance the night away in Rome
And my Lear jet takes me home
Everything is for something
Baby, baby can't you see
I'm just great
I'm just great (great!)
On set my nigga I'm my own man
And I stay in my own lane
Many of you niggas sound the same
Look, you can blame it on drugs, and you can blame it on music.
While you lean, now hell, while you dream
Bitches drinking lemonade, I'm the coolaid man
I'm standing on the corner with a Coolaid stall
It doesn't matter, they were never mines
LBC, we've been known to put our G on
They call me Don Corleone, that's the corner where he is, P-I-M-P
She's a freak of the week, I'm teaching niggas how to eat
Cause I'm deep in the streets
Bitches drink lemonade, but I'm the Coolaid man
Now baby Mr. Coolaid Man, Mr. Coolaid Man
Now baby, yeah, girl, that's the Coolaid Man, they call him the Coolaid Man
S-N-double-O-P, Mr. Coolaid Man, yes, that's him.
Now baby (diggity hot dog)
Lean on Me
I'm big Snoop D O double G
And now everyone wants a scene about me
S al N double O P al D al O double G
Soft with vocal tone
I'm rockin 'into the microphone
Ask for? and Michael Vick
I know the Eagles will be back next year
But don't even stumble, because Snoop Dogg is holding tight
And take you to the mothership
And then they try to stop it
But you can't because I'm hard on the painting
When I break freestyles, I pass out the suckas
Everything is out of the dome
Big Snoop Dogg and I'm half way home
And this is how it goes
Have a seat, come and kick me
But you know we don't quit
I went to the kitchen and had some chicken wings
And the baby said "Dogg, can you sing?"
That I just put on top of my head
She says "Snoop Dogg breaks it down!"
I got the wrappers and got the snapshots
I have the bag and he has the Lac
Cosmic Kev, this is how we do it
Big Snoop Dogg comes with the fluid to do it
To give you what you want, because I know what you need
You thought I was gone, but I still couldn't go
She says "Snoop Dogg, don't worry about that grandson!"
And a BET, everything is on the way, and you know how to be
I have been doing this since I was 17
And niggas 16, niggas 14, it doesn't matter
Drumming with hunnid bands
Break a bitch, hit the switch and lower your back
True sharks become guppies, everyone drowns here
When everyday for me is New Years Eve, Swizzy's countdown (Snoop)
Snoop dogg
It's cold for a winner in the winter
For a rich shit Crip can get, Big Dogg, pick up the trash
Selling marijuana, selling songs, I got shows on four channels like
Go crazy on this bitch, right, right (Snoop Dogg)
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, countdown, 1
Snoop dogg
I'm trying to see what nigga these niggas conspire to gank
Also, his friend is not around, so they better hit him
It is life in the county and the county is very sad
And I left him with two black eyes
You confused the damn system, when you need it to be
{*interlude*}
Boy, when you go out, you will never come back
I tell you it will make a hard punk
Uhh, later that night, quite a fight
But it's a night, because it's a black and a white
You ran out of the brotha
Niggas, you know, you guys are the craziest
Keep it true and already County Blues doing this
And if you've been, you know what I'm talking about
Peep game cause I'm throwing a real one in your fake ass
Sitting in a crowded tank
If it's me it's on
County life and county gives a lot of blues
Swole up swell, roll it up with two black eyes
Or if you use blood pulling meat
Because at some point in your life, you catch the county blues
Where fools always wonder
It got you in trouble
You expect to be transferred to a module
You're already thinking "I hope they don't mess around"
You went with the brothers, that's what they reviewed
You better recognize the rules or every time you come back ...
I hate the marked niggas who come screaming about what they got on the streets
Shut up nigga liar
Niggas always lying
Understand what I say?
So if you see me in the county jail, don't check me
And the size is not shit where you are
I'm really kicking you, so you should be real with me
But when they catch you, you get a fat cock ...
You know what I'm saying?
Crazy!
Look outside and take a walk with me
California lifestyle, do you want to roll with me?
Guide you, guide you, deceive you, it's fragile
Yes, I see you gradually grow
Crazy!
These streets are ...
Long Beach to Compton
Cra ... crazy! (Crazy)
Always up to no good
Fuck the law, they don't catch us, we just do-da-da
I will break you, shake you and take your place
(Always up to no good!)
Crazy!
Crazy!
(Always up to no good!)
Always up to no good
(Always up to no good!)
Ayy Snoop, tell them what's up, dude
Yes ... what's going on? Let you know a little about me. I'm Junior Boy Fleetwood ... from a small town called Long Beach. You may have heard of it. Yes
Hard life, man of the night, this shit is so real
And he rocked them like we were slandering a frisbee
Pop some shots where your moms and kids will be
Long Beach nigga we're all crip ci-ty
I'd rather have you in my soul
So no one can be against us
The way they see you flex here
Run and dance
I will get my crown
Yes
I try to take my life and leave everything
Oh lord we need you now
So I will keep running this race, yeah
So no one can be against us
I will get my crown
But it's time for us to wake up and realize that we need God
No we didn't, see if you can remember this shit
Because we all love and yes, this tha dub
But I fucked up and scratched his chrome
Now I have to get some of my chrome on my own
Put the switches of your riches
See, that's the plan they brainwashed me for not knowing
But nigga fuck what you're going through in this 2-0
I'm on a mission with the Mashin boys again
Me and my niggas are representing LBC style
We directly bangin
You have to be able to hit yourself alone, man
Chorus (with Snoop)
Snoop D
Party at home like a motherfucker, full of my friends (full of my friends)
I heard he turned around, took off his clothes (yeah, woah)
36 O's, pair of phones
Sexy girl, you came to the party (yeah)
Company of 3 (3, baby)
Hit your walk, jump towards it (walk towards it)
You know I'm a dog, but there is no petting

What the party is going
Get up and ohhh party yeah (Snoop and Marvin, Marv and Snoopy)
Get up and ohh party, yeah (sing a song, get up)
Banging my ass (from whom?)

You in the coupe with Snoop
Makes you say di-du-ti-du-grid-oove
Banging my ass (from whom?)

Strike (15x)
From D-A-Z
We moved mountains, we flow like fountains
And that's not the same with this Dogg Pound Gang
Makes you say di-du-ti-du-grid-oove
I am known worldwide as OG Snoop Dogg
I'm known all over the world for fadin 'em all
From D-A-Z
Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Everything goes and yes, I mean everything
So I pointed to these nuts and then yelled ACTION!
He keeps a bad ho, I keep a bad ho
Slides me new hoes wherever we go
Yes these hollywood nights
Because you are older than all
All the things that I did wrong
Because there is joy in the song that I sing
He's defeated (defeated) again (again, everyone)
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (Scold you, yeah)
You have to know, I have to reinvent it
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (He is rebuked here, he is)
He's defeated (now I don't look like the things I've been through, someone help me)
He's defeated (Can you grab someone's hand and rock me, good night)
Visualize like me
All I want to do is be inside of you
And I give you more
Don't stumble, I won't leave you for
No entry, that's my baby
I think it's all of the above
Hello baby, ooooooohhhh
Got me out of my head
He is here to stay, he is here to stay
Uhh, oh yes, I am
Make my children do yours
Nowadays I don't move, wow, I changed my style
So good it made me speak different languages
And that?
No, what you cut is not mine
Gangbang Nigga With The Basic Fuck
Dis finna be a breeze
Dis finna be a breeze
And my keys
L.B.C. yes i'm on the moon
Zone by zone, I will roam Rome
I'm really home, I'm barely gone
But I only had a whole bone around my neck
Yes music please
Dis finna be a breeze
And my trees
Damn, what did you put me in?
I thought it was fine to be a breeze
For my soul back
We don't even care
I can't lose, I drink and surf
'Cause I'll be damned if I'm broke, starving, living out of a can
My mind focused on my money.
So my shit is tight
And if I'm wrong, then the beach I'm from is not a row
But this role is not a drug
Whatever you use
All you need is your dog collar! (With diamonds on the baby)
It's not too much, just too hot to rush
Sit back, relax and let me go ahead and talk
I'm going to go into that because you know I can
Intelligence, elegance
And what you wear is irrelevant
Is this prestige, necklace?
We don't even care
We will have a lot of fun together
Everything you need in your dogg necklace! (With diamonds on the baby)
You're down with me
Everything you need in your dogg necklace! (With diamonds on the baby)
It's doggy style
It's doggy style
How do we do this?
How do we do this?
How do we do this?
How do we do this?
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Snoop:
(Timbaland)
Say what you say
Because what is all I see fizzor (uh)
But as for mizee, I have gizees (what)

Man, I give the blues to the sucka M.C., who are you?

Let's make a move for this article, where do we roll dog? (Uh-huh)
We have to receive the payment, make money with all of you (what)
I'm so flying like a dove, I come from above
Yes, they are going to have your baby
But that's one to grow black, let me flow (cuzz)
Snoop:
No rappers hollerin LBC
Now when I grow up I want to be like Snoop, crazy pussy and women
Females with the almighty paternal
Than
Uh huh
Uh huh
Down to spend every last dollar I earn
My nigga truck windows fall off, not the move, I give it up
We live it, so we don't stop for shit
We have Dogg House in your mouth, where the accessories for it, come on
Chorus:
My home, sweet home {ooohhhooo}
Affiliate, trust, no niggas fucking with us
These niggas must be crack
Because my bones try to go like the age of the disco
Where we are going (wherever we are going)
The bone of my knee is connected to the bone of the thigh.
And my thigh bone is connected to my hip bone
Ha, that's a piece of chicken
Finger licking good
We are the most bop boppin on
Or you'll get them all brown
When will these enemies listen?
That I'm going to keep doing this until my coffin
Young man lissing
We break the rules cause I'm a damn fool
My contratissifie
Is who i am
Originally
It will definitely make you move
Uh i can dig it
Overworked but still committed
If I went out at 4:20 every day, you could light a J
I live my life like it's a party
Na-na-na-na-na-nananana
I got myself a sweet
You think you could smoke like me and Snoop, don't try to compete
If smoking weed is going down, then I show up
The grass is where they need me, it's a necessity
If I don't have it, little shit brings out the best in me
Enough to wake up the neighbors.
KK my favorite flavor
Just put it on the paper
Known for keeping the room cloudy
Even getting him on the plane, TSA doesn't even realize
It's legal now, everyone is doing this
So go ahead and put your J on top
2X HOOK: Snoop Dogg
Waniac, Trip Loc and Goldie, 4 Tay from the bay, what you say
Yes, I have the humidity, do you have the gas in the tank?
Down on the Yellobrick trail, my destination, Dogg House
Looking for the magician, crawling through the mist
They'll be strippin 'and wigglin' ass
I hope you have brought your pass to the beach
And so it is when you fuck with me
My connection, long rangers
They save us, let's talk about bein beaches
Hit the grass that lights, outside little niggas are fighting
This bomb, I'm likely
Nigga ready to ride as soon as she gets dressed
Remind me of the noisiest place.
Puffin in some bomb of my comrade Blue
House shoes with the khaki blue suit and my locs on
Nigga Goldie Loc got the heat on roast
About to do it, I bet he's off the hook
Let me hear you say pimps, banks, scammers
Let's all get the money and then murder these motherfuckers
Motherfucker, they can't stop us
Now place your helicopters, in case they roll with them.
I turned them off, DoggPound for them bitches
I see you with snitches every time I hit switches
DoggPound gangsta cry for life
Shit dogg (called snoop)
The first thing I grab is some masks and a 4-0
First trip in the police car
Doing it, rolling it, giving it
Shit dogg (called Snoop) that's correct (SNOOP!)
Dogg shit (called Snoop), Dogg shit (called Snoop)
When my mom used to hit the O'Jays
Cause I'm the damn dogg called Snoop
There are a lot of people out there who are talking about all that
Blacks think they are cocaine, knowing they explode
So when you see me tread, understand that I like to flow
Now it's that P-O-U-N-D, uh
I flow and flow with the Snoop Doggy Dogg
And I win - oh my god like Obano
I go for riz-eals, the real thing is what I kick
Dont wait
I'm only on the microphone and I'm not perpetrating
I chose another whole car
Your boy wants another race
I was last seen doing two ninety-eight
In a silver and black S2000
Burning rubber, breaking like this
And fold these others, even my brothers (what?)
Gran Turismo number 3
Be careful with the curve, the cars will crash
I know you stray right there
Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo
Is it the tightest game?
Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without blue notes
We would like to welcome you to fabulous Carolina West
Put me in the game when I walked through the door
I hope you burn
It's the bauble, patty-whack
I still have the biggest bag!
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
You niggas better recognize
I'm such a G, tied up with harsh tactics
I come from the
Used to chill out with Dre at Compton
I'm handing out blues, I'm pissed off like bad news
And I smoke weed for shit
Ruff and tough shit, it's not explanatory how I get mean
Press the button and the light turns on like Red Dawn
You really don't know, are you, are you fucking with a pig?
You can't do me, I'm going to go crazy like O-Dog
Diggity-Daz out of the damn cut once again
Until I die, I'm still screaming, "Bitches ain't shit!"
As you move through the gangster shit
I can see and I can say that's what you want
Then I turn on the chronic so I can get high
I promise to smoke chronic until the day of my death
It's a Doggy Dogg world
(I'm leaving with a baby)
And you're still in debt
Niggas is having more bad times than Captain Rat
You have more problems than an algebra test
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaa !!

And then, gather your crew and roll
You can take off your shoes, sit and lie down

You can take off your shoes, sit and lie down
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaa !!
Somewhere it is, call it LBC

Oh me, oh me, (yes) oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (yes, Doggystyle) I (Doggystyle)

Oh I, oh I (I can feel it) oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh I
I like it so
You will not do it
Won't you Doggystyle?
Won't you hit him from behind?
(Doing it doggy style)
With Dr. Dre
Give me my glass of pimp
I learned G, how C from L.O.C
Long Beach is the city, 20 cryp is the gang
I tried to play the young friend, I tried to take his money
I get on this bitch, they say "that nigger is a beach"
If I hit it and get it, leave it
So I'd rather fuck around with all this whitish then
You just do it, you shake it, I take it
I'm so in love with the game and I can't fake it
I can not take it anymore
Can you dig it
This is some of that A-B-C R-I-P ooh-wee
Can you dig it
Hello Snoop Dogg, can you tell us a story before bed?
Just another day in my old neighborhood
Swang them enemies, hit them hoes
20 minutes later, I changed their clothes
I have hers, hers and your bitch too
Relax and watch your great friend do this shit
Crush grapes to drink fine wine
S to N, double O, P
Won't you put it up in the air once?
Leave shit with the model
Hanging in high school, blowing in the trees
Won't you put it up in the air once?
Relax and watch your great friend do this shit
Niggas don't make or break me
Won't you put it up in the air once?
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen
{* scratched *: "Let's describe a certain female"}
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting heavy
When I start fucking every day of my life
It didn't really matter what the bitch looked like
Wouldn't you believe it, Dogg like a retriever?
I got on this big fat bitch named Treva
No pressure, later that semester
She left me with the name of her friend Tanisha
I had to meet this white bitch, her name was Tammy
She brought some new tricks, flipping them squirrels
It is real in the field, make no mistake.
Over and over again she would bring me outbreak
I'm on another shit, got a phone call
From the damn president, all of you
He left his daughters and a lot of cash.
Great pimp, in D.C.
They are outstanding, you know, like Yvette
We fuck in the car, behind a bar
Look, they taught me and they taught me
I'd better move a little quick if I thought that
Look at some different things, I'm a different cut
Oh do you want to show off? I also want to show off
Shit, everything is fine, because everything was fine
It's a 90 percent chance that she gets pimp juice
Now you live with that ho and you all have children
Bitches will be bitches when the Chevy breaks
It's getting, it's getting heavy
I go to school from my mother's apartment
My friend Dogg is getting cold in a Benz
My sisters are cute but she has no team
I have beans, rice and bread on my shelf
They bother me like an idiot
I do it once, I do it twice
And now there is a stake with beans and rice.
I wear a G per week, fuck the school
Me and my brother bounced off the Benz
An automatic weapon sprayed my car cold
Doggz will catch you
On top of that, I'm there to earn it
And all I could was my brother
Dogg jumped up and started running
Now when I went there the boys in blue go
They shot down one, shot down two
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
You see the moral of the story is this
You mix the two, you're bound to get a little drama
This is real
Your so called dogs feel lonely 2
Bow-wow
You can ask all my friends, all the D.P.G. I have tenderoni
Now when we're on the road trying to get this role
I buy you something to go to the movies too
If that's what you want to do, that's what you're trying to do
Because I have to get this cheese with my crew
You don't stay with me, you're always out to play
Smoking in that Doh 'Doh' (Doh ')
Here we are, here we go again
My shit at the record store
Go and exploit it, tell a friend
That nigger prostrates himself before the city's new sheriff
I will shine when I come down
Most niggas on the block know what I'm talking about
Oh yeah, that back door is my soft escape
Get down inside the bucket
Why don't you let me know who has a gun for sale?
Shit, I'm trying to sell everything
East Longbeach City thing
(Chorus)
(Soopafly)
Baby, what do you say that Take-take?
Much, they have a pot of fetti '
East side rider
And I still can't vote
Shut up and go crazy with that white boy who called you nigga
Doh 'rae me fah, so get the smoking shirt on that Doh'!
Ayyo, ayyo, ayyo Quik look at this dog
Now if that nigga next to you has a rental car
She acts like her hair, but you know what happens
But guess who's calling, Pipedream Patty
I made that nigga park my whoride next to the alley
Tootin 'in that cocaine, damn wit that bad
I remember Marley Marl and the Juice Crew
That is probably the reason why I keep a tight grip on my deuce-deuce.
Let's say they're doing too much, yeah nigga, you're doing too much
Look, don't hit a nigga like me (why?)
When she fell on me
But my friend fell in love and he deposited it
Back in the county with the red ribbon on his wrist
Now when a nigga hits his girl and she doesn't respond
And when the homey in the pen doing a sin
And his girlfriend with her best friend
Let's say you're doing too much, hell yeah, you're doing too much
You're doing too much when you hold on to my tone
Talk for hours, wasting power
You know she's doing too much, yeah baby, you're doing too much
6, 5, 4, 3
Bigg Snoopy D-O-dub cousin
I want to talk to you for a minute
Try this shit once
Work a nigga until you feel like I'm going to pass out
Now do it do it do it do it! (How you want to do it?)
Do it do it do it do it (How you want to do it?)
But hurry up before that white bitch comes and catches up to me
When I first stepped on everything in this place

She knows about the digits in my bank account
And we with crazy girls, so girls have to be on it (Come on)
From zip to LBC, we make girls receive W-E-T
Tequila drove me nuts, Russ packet, fruity (Nigga)

I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
You all niggas know who I am you niggas crying shit
Dogg's Pound and the Fabulous Dramas
I'm listening to motherf ** kers trying to steal my stream
Using my styles as a contraceptive
It makes me want to scream, because my dollars come in ozones
You are a flea and I am the great Dogg
And look where I come from, it's still East Side until I die
Don't worry, but check the technique, I am unique like China
I want to see some panties falling
I'm from LA I used to chill out with Dre at Compton
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I stay and move
You really don't know, do you, you're a damn relative with a pig
It doesn't stop (and uh) it doesn't stop (for him)
Pound Dogg clique (to drop the Dogg cavvy shit)
So take a seat and take your gin and juice and watch the flow
Now that the Pound breaks down with gangsta funk
I promise I will smoke chronic until the day of my death
"Is the muthafuckin DPGC still together?"
"Dogg, they will still be together, I heard they broke up like the fat ones."
Nigga what, nigga this dogg pound for life nigga
And uh, I'm a deal with that DPG-style shit
What the fuck made you think the DP split?
Advancing to the top of the map
Because gangsta will be here until the curl returns
Hit a nigga in your face until your damn eyes turn purple
I fixed my shit, got the meter rack
For me and my crew, nigga the gray and the blue
Through you you knew you shouldn't have done that
Because all we want to do is put the G back on you
You niggas need to tie down or pack up
See why I keep him gangsta and hang around with the sickest clique
Kurupt and Snoop, Daz in the clique of muthafuckin bomba
Wait until I wait until I catch them
This did tell me some stupid things
Man don't be silly and create that shit
I don't want anyone to fuck with me on these streets, uh-uh
Nobody has time for that
The same rules and regulations apply, code G
See I'm real with my niggas, I kill for my niggas, I'm affiliated
Big Snoop Dogg with my cousin Trick Trick
In the celly with the plinug
I know I have them right
And I'm the G who is going to see them
Holla in a black in the DM
All I know is hitting the beach (Long Beach)
40 years nigga, hitting the east
Even though I have a grip, still 20 nigga crip
There is no need to stop, he is the man.
What we can't do is movement
I don't hang on my hood but I hit my hood, I'm affiliated
See I'm real to my niggas, I kill for my niggas, I'm affiliated
Don't commit the crime if you can't do the time
I'm not fucking king with them niggas no mo
He had his boys covered, with gold chains
F ** I pulled out some of my money
Wear a new Dionne Scott silk outfit
But I know deep in my heart
Every time I throw something at you
But it's a cold game
I'm not making the rules for this game
Look, everything I know and everything I do

It looks dead on the chips, I blink, they dive, it's hard to hold on
(Do not let him go) ...
If your bitch is seen with one of my niggas on the click
You better believe she ate a gangsta dick
Because you're on a fucking limb with Slim
Cause I'm a gun packing, a car stealing, hoe hitting MC
They had hot friends on the street and they still killed them.
Homicides, transfers and kidnappings
Shit, when you walk out the door, nigga, don't forget your fo-fo '
Cause niggas everywhere get loud and fight, and don't hesitate
Because like I said, when you're not with that, those niggas go crazy
It looks like it's on, but it's off, I keep losing and shit
I'm stoned but I try to stay focused with my eyes wide open

Hello what's up

He has not returned, I cannot return

I was wondering why my homie baby momma was blowing up my beeper
Telling the brats about my furniture and jewelry
Hit like you're supposed to hit if the vibe is right tonight
When I get this pussy you will tell me
It's not fun if friends can't have any
I know I have a big dick, I shouldn't lend it for a trick
Now you face twenty alone
The nigga you were with the man was rich as hell
When I get this pussy you will tell me
I want to thank me for always being a donor
And thanks a little more, oh yes
I'm trying to double tap that
Slide on your DM, slide on your DM
Oh shawty
If she has to be friends, I'm so confused

Living in the south
Touch the screen twice for the whole
Computer love, I know you want that moon love
Smokin 'up, open, I slide into your DM
Tryna double tap that
I'm trying to double tap that
Raised on the streets, me and my peeps
From the gutter to the tractor floor
She is much more women in this world than boys.
She goes on, says she likes my song
I'm trying to double tap that
Cause I know blacks don't care
Nigga anytime, nigga anywhere
Just in case a nigga tries to catch me
Fuck other niggas' cause I'm depressed by my niggas
Fuck other niggas' cause I'm depressed by my niggas
I'm dying for my niggas (what), man, fuck with other niggas

When you fuck with niggas
Fuck other niggas' cause I'm depressed by my niggas

Fuck other niggas' cause I go for my niggas
Fuck other niggas' cause I'm depressed by my niggas

Some of these niggas are "Bitches 2"
And some of these niggas look like you
Just shit gets thick and call me
Let me tell you niggas (what's up)
You know I'm doing great things for myself
You don't even get it, you know what I mean?
Anyway, check it out
And I don't have great things, isn't he a man?
A black gangsta on his throne, isn't he a man?
You know I'm so good, don't you man?
A lot of niggas pimps are showing up
Since me and Magic Juan made it popular
Oh, waaaah, isn't he a man? x8
Jacob, boy, fly away, all the players are tied up
If you don't respect my pimp try to fuck my hustle
Yes
Different locations, places where it takes place
If you cut off my money, your ass is slicing
There are four main games that run the city of G
The offenders, the prawns and the corleones and me
Me and my cousin Corleone run downtown
Unload on your butt, start taking them out!
Gangs have taken over 75% of our city as youth
What they earn is more than $ 700 million.
Now searched by the IRS and we will convict you for tax evasion
I've been around since Jumpstreet blew it up
He had to be a standout not to run out
You hold your heat but those devilish enemies
Don't talk on the way, more fools are listening
I'm taking them out!
In my area, Don Corleone wanted
He ordered to hit and watch him kill again and again
As I am shot by a brand from the enemy park
I've got the city of Long Beach crazed on drugs
I text your boyfriend, he said this bih always tripped
I let a bitch slide for a minute, now I'm back in this pimping
Oh
Do you like i do (all the time)
You only see me late at night when a nigga wants to fuck
I love you like I do
I love you like I do
Remember
Did you remember how it used to be?
Shake hands, make plans with me
Pray for me so I don't get hurt
Contradict me, but I'm too slippery
It doesn't really matter unless you say you're going to bring the thing
Don't call me Snoop or Calvin [?]
It's not my dad, but pop becomes weasel
See the block heats up when you are not ready to fire or get fired
This is a public service announcement aimed at everyone who hates paper.
Smoking you and your crew, taking a life or two
You don't like how I'm living well, fuck you
My nigga C is gonna fuck you up in a minute
About drinking directly the ???? bottle
Do I look like a damn role model?
What the hell are the screams?
Gangsta gangsta, that's what sells
Homies all standing just hanging
He got scared and hit the gas.
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they scream
He represents the tank but difficult to hit.
I said "see you later" I jumped in the browser
TRU niggas on the scene with the triple beam
And I'll smoke a motherfucker like it's nothing
We want to fuck you C
If you fuck with me, I'm a smoke your butt
I wouldn't have had a problem
A motherfucker without becoming a submarine, he plunged underwater
Now you have no paper, and now you are in a paper caper
In the Doggy Dogg world
Blacks want to come back, I know, so they tied me up
And now I'm back on set and I'm walking
I'll hit your ass and stomp on you
With Buck, Banks, 50 come just to stomp on him
Yes Yes Yes
Mashin with G-Unit, we do it, nigga, move it
I got you on my infra, fuck you and I'll catch you
You keep talking shit, I'll put my gun in your mouth
Man, vaginal niggas don't deserve to breathe
It's nothing like the smell of gunpowder, projectiles hit the pavement
We're on deadly grounds, I've been to hell and back
Hanging from the back of the black Cadillac window
Adrenaline pumping, infrared on his temple
My gun in your mouth, I'll show you what I'm fighting about
We smoke more than you can bear
You keep talking shit, I'll put my gun in your mouth
Speak without a doubt
Hit you with the drip, Snoop Dogg is in the house
And if a black man has an attitude
With steel that will make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
I have the Rollie on my arm, and I'm pouring Chandon
I keep a blue flag hanging from my butt
I can't pretend, just break it, and when I take it
I have a room full of fine baits
Waiting for the Pizzle, Dizzle and Chizzle
When pigs try to reach you
Park like it's hot, park like it's hot, park like it's hot
Explode it like it's hot, exploit it like it's hot, exploit it like it's hot
And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it running
I'm a bad boy with a lot of hoes
I drive my own cars and put on my own clothes
On the TV screen and in the magazines.
Your family is crying, now you're on the news
Subscribe nigga get your problem
Snoop
And I roll the best grass because I got it going
Don't stick with "Pacin", but these guys explode like "Pistons"
While my niggas on the street push shit like Ben Wallace
Because the doll freezes
And the Enzo is a quarter of a million for each wheel
Fall, fall, like I'm hot, fall, fall, like I'm hot
I have the rollie on my arm and I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best grass because I got it going
Too much dynamism for these pesky niggas to get through
Tell your lawyer "Take that civil case and leave it as if it were hot"
Spend money mang
And I roll the best grass because I got it going
(Around the world)
Now my life is fine, because my wife is on my right side
Now I'm on the move, they have me jumping these fences
Tour ma
And I roll the best grass because I got it going
East side shit, everyone knows how we got down
7 tide a wizzle, Bigg Bow Wiggle's, up on the hizzle
Let my friends out of the yard
Is it possible that the laws get jealous?
Nate Dogg, Goldie, Snoopy, Deee Tray
It's still the same, let the mothaf ** kin 'doggs out
Explosion in everything you suck with the daily shot
Have you ever seen someone here who didn't give a shit?
Niggas on the streets will keep on talking about you
And try to turn friends into traitaz
Who let Eastside Ridaz out?
Gang bang niggas, let's turn this bitch
No one does it better! {Echoes}
It's 1 a.m. and the crowd is still alive
Relax to the beat, I mean, just move with your boy
Go feel at home, you have big grilled meat
2-1, 1-9, 2-0, everyone in the house
You see we like to keep it harder
What do you want? Made of matter, what do you need?
5-7 clean, that's the big whip
Coach king yeah I earned due
Pimp hoes, pimp clothes, yeah I earned that shoe
I had you in the club for 10 years drinking slowly
For my fucking classics and it was all keeping it true
Feeling just blowing domes in the fucking game
I have all kinds of cars, so now I only play paint
He did it the G way, he said, she said
I gave life to the game and you were behind on your accounts
Nigga with an ungrateful ass, all the kids I've fed
Watch me walk and everyone do it too
They play follow the leader, boss on the move
I'm listening to muthafuckas trying to steal my stream
Put me on the game when I walked in the door
Now tell me, what's going on?
And stop trying to spit on my damn hoes!
But not when it's time to wreck, check, and rip?
Ready to do a trick and I can tell by his lips that my cock would fit
And once everything dissolves (on the left)
As if it were 4/20
Here is my metaphor (cookies)
You are so edible (girls)
And it makes you want to do it (on the left)
And mixed with music (on the right).
Pass the Dutchman on the right
Makes musical life (cookies)
And once everything dissolves (on the left)
And it makes you want to do it (on the left)
And once everything dissolves (on the left)
And it makes you want to do it (on the left)
Pass the Dutchman to the left
Pass the Dutchman on the right
As if it were 4/20
Don't go less, you go hard
Go less, go hard
Did you know I never would
Clarify ride, we bonafide dippers
ESPN, you know Sports Center
With the skirts dragging, with the plate in the back
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon
First things first, my nig ', you better know where you are
Go less, go hard
Hollywood, downtime and return
I knew I never would
Riding in 405
Sur Surfer Cali
I just left the Nico, turn left at Pico
Athletes and even teachers
First things first, my friend, you better know where you are
Yes
I don't give a shit because I know we have two Glocks
Doggy Dogg is on the mic and like Karim he hit me
Your hoe was on my cock, because she knew about my clique
9-4 is the baby taste, we'll be kicking like
I don't bite, I'm so dumb, I write my own shit, suck your ass, nigga wrote your style bigger, come see mine
How do you go crazy like that, I'm the baddest
Check me out
Because of this flowing nigga and I make them go and show any other motherfucker from anywhere else who tries to get close
Look at him, G is up, if that bitch can't swim, then she's going to drown
This is Dogg Pound, so check your house, Snoop Dogg is on the mic with the G-funk sound
Just harassing and [?] And I throw up a pound, hitting motherfuckers and you know I'm gross
Cause I'm a G for life and I go and walk until I can't see a thing
So just check my flow as I blow like the wind
I'm that nigga they call Kurupt, these niggas who talk shit When they come in and oh they fuck
So I'm chilling out like a spit business game on this trick bitch
In a chronic fat ass and some fat cocks
You have everything you need
Yes i remember the times
So everything
I will comfort you, I will give you all of me
It will be you and me
Have fun with me as I run these streets
A boss hit, a boss lady, that's you
Float on the boat, just the two of us
I will be, I will be
I give you my love every day
I was in town on mine (you know how I do it)
And I knew it was a dog, I had to put it on pause
But you really need a girl who understands you (really)
It was like a blind date because I don't see it coming
Yeah my type, no stereo (my nigga)
I'm not talking, just giving you a stage (just playing)
So everything
It will be you and me
I'm yours anyway
We're not fucking with them Swishers
So go slow
Catch it, I can't scratch it
Let's fly forever
Yes
And don't let it go until you're connected
Motherfucker of the Executive Branch
And I'm not hitting a hustle of niggas, it's all a game
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
I do it because I'm sorry
Vietnamese eyes firmer than ever
Fuck the Dogg, I'm biting whoever
So if you ever taste success just pray for a tall glass
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
At least he came with some toys like a happy meal
Get away from me, loneliness
I stopped visiting when I was a sophomore
I guess all I hate about myself I see in him.
I'm about to hit the ground
Look at it with your eyes closed
Girl you got me fading
I don't know what to do because you have me confused
We are talking on the phone
I love you well
There are no other words to say
Girl you got me fading
Tee Wee when they see that he's a G
That's what my grandmother says
Me and Dan Funk, we capture the fun.
The vish, in the wind that you blow
And I can't go another day
Girl you got me fading
Long time, I have no news of
Girl ... you got me fadin away
Makes it hard to stay awake
Girl you got me fading
Girl you got me fading
It is very difficult to stay with your girl
And even harder to play with your girl
One lil, two lil, three lil G's
Leaning on the cut, about to be busted
I've shot a lot of blacks and cops, so fuck it once
I can't be fucking with my niggas while they do drugs
Now a little muthafucka done threw me
Spitting game on my friends about the old days
For Chino, I see no reason to cry.
I adapt quickly, don't take shit from any niggas
Considered the coolest, because of the way I live
How I feel about Snoop
How I feel about Snoop
I'm inside like I spread it, if I said it, all the unleaded gas
How I feel about Snoop
How I feel about Snoop
This is DJ EZ Dicc
Just lie down and open your mouth
Cause I've never met a girl
That i love all over the world
They drive me crazy and crazy
So I'm going to fuck a few more times
And then I'm done
And you know that bitches ain't shit to me
I don't give a shit
It's not fun if friends can't have any
Hoes recognize, niggas too
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
It's not fun if friends can't have any
Travel with you niggas like
All we have is you and me
I put a smile on your face, let me take you somewhere
The baby had fun and I let him do what he does
I like your taste, you intensify your game
Look at you, look at mine, you look good, I wish you did!
I'm like a star is born, and I'm next
Make you fall, turn around, it's your world
Cuban convertibles and bonds as a prize
My eye (first place), ooh
'Before a nigga shows up, you gotta wrap me up
From a little nigga, Dogg has it crackin '
The gold medal caught my attention, I have to have it
More wins than Kobe and Shaq did
Who sold millions of records and focused?
It never stopped, no no, not at all
From the streets of Long Beach, it's the Dogg
I always got there first, I'm never tied up with you
First place (first place)
Chorus: (Nate Dogg)
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
I am working late
(why) Because I'm flying, yeah, super fly Nate dogg
Oooooowwwaaooooo I'm flying, yeah
And we say you want another kisza
I know you feel all hurt inside
P my technique
But I'm a c-r-i-p with some p-i-m-p too
It is best to enter
(W)
Stacie Adams with a drink
So what, the ladies wink
You the mercedes, you shot with the thang
In everything that hates my fame
It showed in the car
To me, you are that special girl
And I love your personality
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
(I always want to fly with you)
So far
(Let's fly away)
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
(So far)
I want to fly so far
I bought everything, don't rent shit, shit G
Training to make the fleece look good
I'm in that shit of who do you want to be
Hood politics, all the real nigga battles
I'm still standing because the way a nigga handled that
10 fingers down, never acting like a brand
Focus on me
10 toes, I did that, I did that
Big mouth Crip and the bitch niggas can't shut it
I was chosen
10 toes, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
Look at these other fools but you can't see me, nigga
So all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your damn fingers in the air
Comes With A Gangsta Fucking Fist For Ninety-Three
And leave me and my Dogg Kurupt to fuck
Now no one can see me here or there
Wherever it comes out, I put it everywhere
With the rhythm flossin of gold D's
I pack a strap like this, kick it like this
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
17 shot Glock lopsided so all niggas fall
Motherfuckers fly can't see Kurupt
Runnin em as Flo Jo, stranded on death row
Shake your damn hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Check it out, it's Rage, ready for collapse
Album: In Tha Beginning ... There was Rap
These are the stories that I tell so well
She was like a puppy on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
I tell you homey if you get a piece
And like Lori, she is a true complacent
G'd this girl, her name was Tammi
She had a best friend, her name was Janet
A week passed and I was back on it
Two tons of fun, Big Mad Magenta
I said, "I'm not cool, or gigolo
She was on her knees, begging him to blow
These are the stories that I tell so well!
They said it was for you
Shit nigga, I'm not going anywhere
I talk a little shit, hey hey hey hey
And we will toast this year
Funny style, Kurupt in the building
See you the DPGC shit
Bitches are crazy, they're all on my dick
I'll show you motherfuckers, what's a poster?
You can study my style, you can write my name
I have all my money, all my hoes
Like what's going on and they know
Looking at these suckers pulling millimeters
See this is true, we gray and blue
The word is in the streets, your heartbeat will be delicate
(Now let me shake that shit up man)
(Really, hmm!)
Niggas tryna get to me cause I'm falling funky rhymes
What the hell is going on? This rap game is made to earn money
And if a black man says something wrong, I will leave from the first moment
Because they bombarded me before and I'll tell you, man, that's the worst
And I can't be caught because you know how they do it with that child support
Get 18 points 5 percent, half your life
Shit, I love my baby and everything
Because when you play this game, you have to be the real player
Will be arrested or deceased
I'm not going crazy without any niggas, no bitches
I used to like low travelers but now I like Eastsiders
So sit in your seats and wait until we pass
Until we just keep smoking gray and blue
Sipping my drink, smoking my wet
Counting my bank, uhh, that shit sucked
It's like thanksgiving without the party
They have dogs on my butt, but I'm a Dogg
So I know how to alert and fuck off
The dog ran towards me, I give him a cold
I'm true to what I do, I don't hit at all
I'm getting a little greasy with the curl around my neck
Well, if Kurupt cared about a whore, he would always be broke. I never have MuthaFuckin in the smoke, they drive me crazy and a crazy bitch you can't do to me. Do we look like BBD, hoochie groupie? I have no love for ho's. That's something I learned in the pound, so how the hell am I supposed to pay this ho? I know the kitty mines, Imma Fuck a few more times. And then I'm done with it. There is nothing more to do with it. Pass it to the homie, now you hit it. Because she's just a bitch to me, and you know that bitches aren't shit to me. I don't give a damn. Why don't you pay attention to her and approach her with a different proposal? I'm Kurupt ho, you will never be my only one
It's no fun, if friends can't have any
Guess who's back at the MuthaFuckin house, with a fat dick for your MuthaFuckin mouth. Ho admits, niggas cause when bitches get rowdy and throw a voodoo. What are you going to do? You really don't know, so I advised you not to trust that. It's silly of me to fall in love with a bitch. Knowing very well, I'm too caught up in my grip, now that the sun is spinning and my game is growing. How many bitches want to fuck this nigga named Snoop Doggy? I am all of the above. I am too fast to catch up with you. But look, it's not fun, I'm my friend, I can't prove it, because you know I don't love it
You better get down, blow your head
Yeah damn nigga it's on
For lil niggas in the Cadillac
Yeah damn nigga it's on
When the clips are on the way, you know we spray
I woke up early in the morning with sex for the little birds
Because I get it early at the R Blue Dery
When the money is running out, there is no problem in what I do with you
This is nothing new to you, I do this shit every day
Ski mask, hit your ass up
I'm riding a shotgun in the fleet with Brome
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Look at Tittie Cadillac and I'm with it, you know that
Sometimes I see a good gun, I shoot without my home boys
Don't burn with the feds with that face
For all the Cadillacs niggas.
We don't give a shit, living in a war zone
Gun packing and we blow on this ozone
Different things I have to do, I have to stick to the code
The first Lil 'grinder didn't work for the same reason.
I only feared God in the days in the pen
Ski mask, hit your ass up
I'm riding a shotgun in the fleet with Brome
I have to rush wars with me and we act wrong
For lil niggas in the Cadillac
Do you have a fresh pair of panties?
I have to know, or could you show me
Freak-a-leek, beak beak
Let me guess, you prefer to use cotton
Yeah baby i can read your mind
I know, so what will it be?
They invited me to our annual pajama party
Spit it out, you should split it up
And slide, very smooth like
When are you going to let a black man see it?
Calling all the cars, yeah baby, you're a star
Life is much more precious
How a game will make your chips sink
Keep your head up and stand up
If I stumble, I will fall
What can we call friends
We are not friends by contract, we pursue for life
Hold you own was the code I grew up to see
But Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case
A madman with a 20, now we are very close
Life is much more precious
What you will think
It is very difficult
Will you pick me up?
Will you pick me up?
And there are not many of us that we can call friends
Go up to go down
And really go to town
I said to my man Snoop
She salmonilla
I'm a trip to the death of Def Squad in my chest
Be amazed and flex
You woke up and you're not trying to sleep
That's why he hides my tool inside his room
I'm like baby powder, I'm no other
I know them hoes, we can't love them
Mixtapes I'm on the street they keep bending
Brick City riding, then 'about it' about it
Shoot your city and then Bin Ladin hides
Do you know who got the weed from the bomb?
If you want a problem then come on
In summer
Sure it looks good to me (2x)
Bam! Boom! Whatchu gon 'do cuz?
And I still have my khakis wrinkled
It's the S-N-double-O-P'n
Come in where you fit, follow me (ooh!)
I still have the "Gin and Juice" in hand (Snoop Dogg!)
We clean with millions that fly like a hawk
Because, I've already seen a lot (what?)
This is Archbishop Don Magic Juan
The L.B.C. SAVIOR!
Snoop dogg
Who is the man with that dance? Snoop dogg
Here to annihilate them
But if you give me something, it has to be the sticky one
Green for ounces, lows and lows bouncing
With a car full of bitches cooking grits like Alice
Are they riding to one side? Yes they run aside
Everyone knows the G with the Cutlass Coupe
Yeah I'm straight hanging out with my people
In what I say because what I say is so real
You don't want to catch a body, you came here to celebrate
Don't give a shit about you (shit for you 2x)
You're living on that on that (on that on that 2x)
Just make them read about it (read it 2x)
Stand back from me, you're getting too close to me, son
That is why I am writing to you, I express everything Big Dogg
Don't give a shit
I'm living loud noisy
Fuck what they say about me
As long as it's about that about it
I'm living on it on that
Big D-O-Double G you know I'm living loud noisy
DJ Pooh, KAM, Solo and the damn Los Angeles Zoo
Pomona, DJ Quik and Blacktone
Your monster is a monster, I never dragged myself with the ho
Big Snoop Dogg in this
Can i say it
The building boss feels so cold
Raise your hands
I have 10 shots, that's real
But your bitch keeps looking at me
Before you come to fuck with me
And it covers everything like a mist
Bottle after bottle, nigga, I'm freaking out
From 93 ', above V.I.P
I do this for me, I don't do it for any bitch
Like a b, I don't do this for any butt
The anti player has presented and sent an alpha certificate.
Coming out of your $ 2 mouth
He is a five-star guerrilla, with stars and stripes.
His game is as sharp as a mosquito's needle;
And with this in mind, I'm going to ask Game Court
Because you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And i will break you
And if you can't fuck that day baby
That i love all over the world
They drive me crazy and crazy
So how the hell am I supposed
Now as the sun turns and my game gets bigger
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
So back off, bitch, cause I'm fighting
GAME, that's my thang
I hit the flo 'and when they leave I make sure to grab all the dough
They threw away the key and now I'm an OG
And I'm not trying to keep going, so I'm not fucking with the iron
I got bitches bringing me money and it's not a damn funny thing
My Homeboy Devil from HCG and Young Side Trey R.I.P
GAME, that's my thang
Keep them snitches on the sidelines
It's the ones inside that make you
Who is not sure if it will go down?
If the other two above are not raised
And there are no rules when you're in this game
And there are no rules when you're in this game
GAME, that's my thang
Or represent your 'thang
I'm not giving a fuck I'm still [? Hugged?]
Around 3:34 in the morning they don't even matter
We puff up all night, direct play, play
A nigga didn't give me any of this shit that's real
I mean what happens to my mom, for giving
These suckas then I surf, my grandmother saw it on the news
I tried to escape, but I couldn't get far
Because friends had the loop that night in King Park
Direct to county without bond
Is it me, in the damn S-5?
So like Snoop in "Deep Cover"
Going down Green Leaf, I have no enemies
It's not a gangsta party until we go and dig up Pac
Hughey P. Newton with Air Force One's on
I ran out of gas in Long Beach, I'm stuck
There are no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck's
I'm in that Bulls shit, the Scott 'Pippen kick
The moral is that my scarf hangs on the left side
(What's up Blood?) Yeah cuz we just capsized
Game, take the wheel and turn on 21st street
We just slide and slide out, we start and go
The one everyone wants to come, hoes who love me, you niggas want to be (Snoop, Snoop)
Time to get this change, I guess I'm like Obama
(Is it G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R or G-A-N-G-S-T-A?)
Say it dawg (Gangsta hehe)
Say it like you feel it
It's going to everyone who hates paper
Food stamps did not arrive on time and lights went out
But look here
Now I'm that motherfucker that you read about
You don't like how I'm living, well fuck you
They gangsters, they're fucking the show
About drinking bottle seven directly
Shit, I'm that kind of nigga that explodes quickly
Niggas living loud and stick with it, with that
"Gangsta gangsta" that's what they're selling
Bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that shit G
We decided to shoot a week deep
Sweating all the bitches on the Daisy Dukes
We couldn't play, ladies
True niggas on the scene with the triple beam
I want to fuck you too
Niggas living loud and stick with it, with that
I went underwater came back with a periscope looking at your bitch ass
I say no, because you have no influence, bitch, go away
They know I make him laugh at this motherfucker
Brown pecan, she's looking for the slim one
To give me brain like a genius
I give you my number to my cell phone
(Girl, you will never meet a gangsta like me
(Blaow!) I limp with my two steps
Tall and skinny and always turned blue
Tell your husband that there is another man.
A pimp from the beach, crocodile shoes on my feet
I give you my number to my cell phone
Play my cards well, will you take me home?
At the end of the night I will take you home)
Snoop Dogg, beach-beach
I'm always with a bad bitch
You could say I have a bad bitch habit
We can do ours but you can't be a wife
Go and let your puppy give you a bone
And sing a little for the ladies
When we do what we do in the back of the 'Llaaaaaaac
Is he one of the best fools in the flo '?
I whispered in his ear, "Come on, are you ready to go?"
She likes that, do you like that?
...Dream
That gang-sta luuuuuuv
She says my name out loud, I say her name quietly
Baby likes the way I wake her up (why?)
We were taught to shit like crazy
... This is the life you show
Do you hear what that boy says?
Then I hit him from behind
...Dream
And every night his body piles up
That gang-sta luuuuuuv
Ayo nephew
You know what I'm talking about
Shawty loves me down
Roll up a winna and lift it up in the air
Kissing you on the chest and I'm digging up your stress
Every time i come
Throw it out like take that
She makes me do what she does when we do what we do behind the 'Lac
I have to have it, the L B raises me
Run to me like click clack
She makes me do what she does when we do what we do behind the 'Lac
That Gangstaa G-Gangsta, Gangsta G-Gangsta, Gangsta G-Gangsta
Dental floss, cream
Then I hit him from behind
Every time i come
Throw it out like take that
Too many escapes, too many bustaz. We do this shit alone
Boo, you are a real bitch
I go out in and out of town like a basketball player
And pass laws with mayors
I swim underwater and I don't get wet
I keep it gangsta all the time
Because I am ...
Dogg Pound just for the pleasure of doing it (Dogg Pound!)
I stay on them like cops
Trying to stop the cars in this fast lane game
Is where my shit is
Flip rats trying to get something back
I'm left with that (with that)
They never recognize and never pay attention
Born gangsta, keep moving (keep going, keep going)
Holla'in at cha bitch (Beeyatch!)
C-walkin 'on the dance floor, throwing up DP (Dogg Pound!)
Rolemode, millionaire, gangsta ass nigga
We stay mobbin while we lynch
Because now I have papers (Enough of that ... Dogg Pound!)
Dogg Pound just for the pleasure of doing it (D-P-G ... Dogg Pound!)
Born gangsta keeping it true
None of you can stop me now (stop that)
You know ... how I change my flow
Because when I lift my shit, I usually pop my shit
I'm the boss, and I don't follow anyone, I follow Jesus
Take your mind high
On the walnut danger side
Take your mind high
We go back to the effect, we have the heat on deck
As we ride, we dive and glide
Take your mind high
(on the south side, on the north side) Yes
(on the west side)
It's a gangsta gangsta ride
Take your mind high
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce ...
I hope things improve for you
And keep the hottest Doggystyle out of the LB
We ride at high tide, this is my side
Oh yeah I'm cool until I expire from existence
You better go and when it comes to you
The game is life, life is fight
So if you fall, I taste it, fragile like glass
Or will you be a man and collect all the pieces?
As for me, I'm trying to keep it real Dogg
Fly G boys and all girls with hood
The best chooses the litter, young black LB
Always the stray try to follow me home
I hit you like Dogg Bopper fever, I'm looking for paper
I want them close enough that I can block them
Just keep it real Dogg
Eliminate, DP eliminate, GC eliminate
Oh you didn't know
Bustin, no need to argue
The Dogg is the Gift like the assassin Corleone
Just keep it real Dogg
When I met you last night baby
Before opening your gap
I had respect for you, lady
Because I have never
I met a girl
That I love
I'd never have a motherfucker to smoke
Do we look alike BBD, hoochie groupie?
Come with a different proposal, I am Kurupt
Hoe, you will never be my only ass trick!
With a fat cock for your damn mouth
What are you going to do? You really don't know
Puppy, I'm all of the above
But look, it's not fun, if my friends can't prove it
Three to get ready and four to press the switches
With bitches by my side and bitches by my back
So back off bitch cause I'm fighting, so get
Chorus
You ugly little nigga!
Too much $ hort ...
I got on the platform and I ran your mouth
Pooh-Man did it! Pooh-Man did it!
Oakland trusta hoe busta
So there it is, crap
And you're not shit but a weak bitch
Ant Banks: read this ...
(What should I do? What should I do?)
Cannot hang on the block
Because you are not shit but a punk
Beep beep beep
I took her to the motel parking lot
And running back saying to all the boys
Bitch nigga ain't got no heart
Get ready to finish whatever your punk ass started
Too much $ hort ...
Kill kill kill
How many killas do you have in your mother, damn pay nigga?
Nigga nigga I'm a rida
I went to jail for years, for movin, burning drugs
I'm not stumbling noo
No limit niggas no strangers
I know your mother feels me
Look, it's all about respect
I'm never caught slipping
Get hooked on rap tag number one
And rap like that
Shit, I can't be duplicated
That put gangsta rap on the map
Can you imagine if I was broke?
And you're a sucka (bitch nigga), and I rock
Look, it's all about respect
Kill-kill-kill
Keep my warmth on the board
Kill-kill-kill
It's not junior personal nut'in
Kill-kill-kill
This real shit
If you are not willing to travel with God
Down to die with god
It came out big
See you now, C and Snoop in the coupe
Just a young nigga struggling to raise hell and send mail
Backup nigga, I can't turn that shit on like drugs
Tied up in my fatigue
I stay fast and work
I break the bitch slowly
Gang intervention, in your position
All my bitches, all my hoes
I said it slowly - woo-op, boo-op, now let it go
I have the bitch that makes the most money
So I light my trees
And she will help me keep my Gs up
Whoah, yes I am
Pack my bags and go
That we will live another day
I'm shell (oh)
Pack my bags and go
On my knees in the night, I pray
You always have something to say
We were raised in the church
No weapon forged against me will prosper
I remember what my grandmother said: "Give us our daily bread"
It's in my heart and my head
Pack my bags and go
You always have something to say
It is the only way you will get it
They'll label you like a crazy nigga
NO .. they are already enemies
Your enemy will respect you and will respect you
And I say that without hate
I have no hatred at all
So I tell you, Big Man
I am the man you think you are
Only more NICCA
Oh, it's not over muthafuccaz
Yes, this Christmas of pimps
Catch a bad bitch, I'm like Dolomite
She's a Christmas pimp, that's what's black
Around the world, around the world
Catch us at M.I.A
Roll up the best dro, we're here now
Roll call, all my dogs, spent 10g at the mall
Round and round we go
Then I spin the balloon, putting my fingers on it
Then I zoom directly into [?], UK, Belgium, then back to France
Adjust / traffic [?], Ten [?] S with the most elegant beach
And then we fly to the states with the cars we drive
And then we end up at leopard nine [?]
Show me how it's supposed to be
Do you see the moon and the sun?
When it comes to freestyle boy I'm so cold
Get the money, bring it back
Steal the money, steal the show
It feels so good to know
Are you awake
Are you awake
It feels so good to know
I have my rhythm, I do my thing
Who's number one (there's nothing new under the sun)
With the G come out
It is time to awaken some ideas from the theory and
When lightning strikes you know
All the girls in this room.
It feels so good to know
Are you awake
I dust off my knees
And take out your gun
It feels good my friend
A drug dealer at the same time I love to smoke
Now $ 20 to my name in this drug game
Now $ 20 to my name in this drug game
Extended Glock clips allow me to copy chips
Cold-blooded murder for [?] This
Cut a shelf when I drop this
The hunger that I have
Putting me here wondering if I should take it from his soul
And took shitty lives for less than twenty before
Because that Magnolia herb still has a sober black
And all we are now are gangsters and thugs
If my yale does not sell, how will we proceed?
Because we smoke a lot of weed
I told her the grass would load 2 the game
Now I have $ 20 in my damn name, and I gotta get more
So I tell nigga that fell to the ground, I'm about to kick a fucking bitch
You call me [?] They get scared, I won't turn until my guns smoke
Greetings loved ones
I just want you to relax once
I took my time on this
They are Quik, Dogg and Teddy.
No, really, hit play!
We used to kick routines and the presence was adequate
The party doesn't rock like it used to rock
Get on Snoop Dogg, he can get you in the game
So fast, so fast
No razzmatazz, I'm just a nigga on the east side
For outlaws, horsemen, and bandits
The party doesn't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
True love, real dubbing, real saniacs
Peace to the deceased who died
What you gonna do
When do we stop at a hood near you?
You know
The party doesn't rock like it used to rock
Clapping niggas, flipping switches, mackin 'bitches
Stacked wealth and mansion businesses
Scoop DeVille
I'm going to shake your land, take a step back and burst you
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
I'm not trying to act, I don't want to act
I was there from the first moment
Rookies and 'Frisco cookies
Put them in a box, Nabisco
And I'm the reason why you're fucking with this ho
Take a step back and check the microphone; 1, 2
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Grapevine, state line
Yes, we let everything slide through the 9-9 but through the R2G
(Really, really) that's real
Do it DPGC Dogghouse Style ... Eastside up, check this out baby
You know you're fast to give me your head
I woke up, I gave him a good scratch
So I call my nigga Clean Right
It's 6 AM, she won't pay you
Hosted and well, anxious like Ginuwine
I have no time to waste time
You make me and I give you back
Come discover the damn thicket, in the dub
And throw one of them
And make sure the radio works
And I will never let you go (I will never let you go)
Clubs, cars, high volume.
I'm a nigga from the south of the south, so FUCK ALL NIGGAZ
Throw them thangs boy, like Sugar Shane Mosley
You know, when I get there, you will hear the helicopter go BLAKA BLAKA
Mr. 9th Ward, you better respect this
Shut up BITCH, DoggHouse BITCH
Shake off the haters, shake off the haters
Now which one of you motherfuckers (??)
GO BACK TO SHIT!
Shake off the haters, shake off the haters
Shake off the haters, shake off the haters
Thanks for everything you did for No Limit
We can do what we want to do after this
Sell it to the damn record stores!
I know they thought it was "The last meal"
Going up
They both fold 15s off the cake
How can I love someone else?
Bad 4 me, fuckin you hoodrat bitches
It's been a dub since he saw the streets
I drove there the other day
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me
How can I love someone else?
Bad 4 me, fuckin you hoodrat bitches
That's my job 2
Some of this gangbang, you know that gangbang shit
Hangin 'bangin' and swinging the keys
Nigga ain't afraid to squeeze
Nigga can't throw this, nigga gotta hit this
Just give it a spin, the shit you can't miss
I'm independent, that's a lot of money
With a coat in the house built for a Laker
I am free and full of grass
I put my records independently
That way, nigga ain't beating me
Cause they don't make lil niggas like me
And send money to my G in the penitentiaries
One in the house, kick the doors off the hinges
I know niggas that explode
You duck (Doug E.) as Fresh
And p.s.s. While he digs to dig us real thugs
Hold it, just until you find a hiding place make the fo'-fo 'snap
You all suck out there being in some hoe shit
All of you, the beach, hating the fools who have to come looking for us
And take out our records independently
East side, Long Beach at the house, you guys
Yeah yeah for life ugh
Uh yeah Deee Tray
Yeah yeah DP
Aw yeah Kurupt
So many niggas I almost forgot all of you niggas
Yeh ballin '
(Ballin ', Ballin', Ballin ', Ballin')
Going round and round
Spinning on the ground (rolling downhill)
I am dancing
Hell yeah you are yeah you are
I have to have it, luxurious
Yeh ballin '
There I go!
Working for me
Because they know
Yeh ballin '
(Ballin ', Ballin', Ballin ', Ballin')
I can't help it
Yeh blew my head off
You know i got you
It's a matter of players, now
Start grinding
Just rolling around your city
Because he is loved
(Ballin ', Ballin', Ballin ', Ballin')
In fact, it's been so long
I fell in love with you, I will always take care of you
So stop stopping and falling
Now stop stop and call
Well the party didn't start until i walked in
And I'm probably not leaving until this is over Henn '
We came here together for fun
Whatever the damn reason they wanted to get me wet
I wish I had, but I didn't
Constant thinking with your dick, and putting faith in a bitch
Dogg is relaxing, makin a killin
That's what I get, I got it right
I get the money, the money I got
Prison for marital assault
You were jealous, it's all your fault
Shootin says it fell short now I'm doing it wrong
And my bitch ended up submerged because I ran out of chips
Next thing you need to do is steal a ball from people (give up black)
Shit is real; we fight for the food
We have to go for the hood that is real
Dubbing, waddup
No way, not how
On the other side where the jeans are
And the black explosion back
Because here, the kitten comes cum
Because I'm a young black man who lives it
Before I got on, I blew over an area
Nigga just fucks with the real 2-0
And two for the shizzo
Little Goldie Loc
Hell nah nigga
Hell yeah I'm from the pound
Dogg Pound Rebound
I'm not discreet when it comes to dogg
Sippin satin silver out of the container
Mathafucker Strap
You see, first things first when you're a grown man
Nigga just fucks with the real 2-0
20 minutes
Roll, roll, roll your dubbing
Goldie Loc and Doggy Dogg
Hit until the sun comes up
Hit it, it won't catch me slipping
While you're at the club, hanging out forever
Rock and roll on a bitch and then grab my dick
No need to try, I can't stop my routine
Keep my pen in hand, go for mine
Yeah nigga, back, hahaha
Fucking these niggas one more time, yeah, yeah
Right here
Okay
Put me on some of that old gangsta shit
(The doorbell rings, the scratching of the needle, "Give me your love")
Every time I get cold somebody ringing my damn bell
Do you want me to bring it to you?
What's up G-Dogg?
You can smoke a pound of yolk every day
You have a big screen TV, man, you want to give up all this?
Well, no?
Batman and Robin, we have a little problem
You MUST act fast!
(When you say scat man, like brother Cuh-rothers?) Uh-huh
You're just a stupid scratch, you're not tough like DeNiro
Batman & Robin, squabbin-ready gats (nigga!)
Splat! Hit 'em like forty-five shells (nigga!)
Lift your lips, don't stumble, tie your shoelace
When I spit, I separate, I turn Harvey Dent into two faces
They want to go to the head and crash
I'm going crazy with your hatter, I see your shit splattered
So, he says, if you sleep, you lose
Cold day in Gotham in bat cave relaxing
Damn, just then, the Bat phone rings
No one can save the day like Batman
Let's skip this fo'-do '!
Let's dive in! Holy Hoodrat Sally smoking crack in the alley
"Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da - da-da-dah - BATMAN!"
Hey? Than?
This is just a long beach thing
Speak that and I will peel you
They jumped into the rabbit hole mission are carrots
Faith in my index, I need it when I scribble, huh
I am not a quit person nor will I match
But if you knew better you would be talking about your dividends
I take them to school, but they don't show me love
Meet a couple of niggas from the gang
You're fucking a cold assassin when I start to spit
We are on a mission to get it, I'm concentrating on the digits
Trying to get mills so my family can say grace
Get it? you drown
Married to the money
Hit my city, my city we hit
This is just a long beach thing
In three "we ride"
One two three - LET'S GO!
All my little friends knock on your pads
No need to play with them, keep hitting you
From the inside out, hit the gap eight
House C, House G, House P, House D
Well, we host wherever we go, exploiting them
I will stay positive and help the children
Now what you should do is read about my past
Yes go and hit your pads
Yes go and hit your pads
Come on little friend, go and hit your pads
Celebratin just hit your pads
All of you soccer players go ahead and hit your pads
I'm not crazy but to do it, huh
To all my future NFL stars (yeah)
Yes, from SYFL to high school (get it)
You are my favorite girl
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
In those days, you were a girl I went to school with
Hurry up and finish so we can see Clueless
I laugh at these niggas when they ask, "Who does this?"
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
When I see my baby boo, shit, I turn dumb
I kindly asked you, don't make the Dogg lose it
Blue inner body rag, and
Now he's screaming, screaming "Snoop!" and
Black and beautiful, you're the one I'm choosing
Long, thin, black and curly hair as if he were Cuban
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
Snoop Dogg clothes, that's what I'm prepared for
Because girl you are so beautiful
You are my favorite girl
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
Ehh ... oh yes, there is something in you ... Oh-hooo!
Yes Yes Yes Yes
Ohh, ohh, oh, ohh, ohh
(Oh ooh)
Lilita cute as a student
I had to tell your moms and sisters to refresh it
(Oh ooh)
Hit a nigga trying to chase him
We just blow and keep the flow moving
Keep plowing, that's what we're doing
(Oh ooh)
(Oh yes, there is something in you)
Ohh, why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Look i just want you to know
Snoop Dogg clothes, that's what I'm prepared for
(Oh ooh)
(Ehh, oh yes, there is something in you)
I hit the world if they are rude to you
Beautiful i just want you to know

(Oh ooh)
(Ehh, oh yes, there is something in you)
Ohh, why, oh, why, oh, why, oh, why?
Oh yes, there is something in you, oh, ooh

Her body tight, too hard not to look
I smiled in the room, a Colgate smile
Spurs Kick Hat with Oak Gray Woods
I'm at the club with the toast
I just want you to know
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
The girls complain that you keep me boomin '
You are my favorite girl
I just want you to know
To keep the drama we've been through)
Right here, right now, I declare
That I'm more than a gangster, a mack, a pimp or a player
Do my best to rewrite this plan
And I'm shooting with the Nation, but I've been doing that
Farrakhan is a prophet and I know it because he shows it
They could never penetrate us, all they do is motivate us
Those who hate ...
I know I'm always on the road, I've always been gone
Well this record is from me to you baby
As soon as I get home, I am looking forward to disconnecting my phone
Rich and infamous with the blue and gray Cougars
Softer than Marvin, I need a Tammi
Because I have rap and I go for your daily work
Until then, I'm relaxing in the day spa
Because without you, none of this is real
Baby you know i
Been around the world
I've been to many places, I've seen unfamiliar faces
But darling, none of them compares to you
My life is like a movie
Been around the world
Been around the world
(None of them, none of them, yeshhhhh)
Platinum Hits Only, W Ballz
Snoop Froggy Dogg and someone new Tha Dogg Pound
Then call 310-D.A.P.O.U.N.D
It is the first annual G-nic and all my Doggs.
Motherfuckers like it's the right thing to do
Eighty-five, eighty-six, eight and three, and year eighty-two (eighty-two)
You know what the hell I'm talking about
And I bet no one brings a fucking gun
Because everyone in the house is two to one ...
Calle 21, busted street, where it all started
And you know East Side, Long Beach, the hardest
So take a step with your rap and we bring the noise
(We were) looking at the niggas that come before me
No one can see you, but you (ha ha, yes, now that's worth it)
Tatataratatatara ...
(so if you're on a nigga mission, go and dive in)
And chronic we can smoke, (and always get a loc)
Because you know I'm wrong with you, so they can get an idea
I play from the heart, I came from the beginning
Now we're breaking them (hmm hmm), shaking them up (yeah)
And just for a second we're waking them up
(continue) Quit the game at this tight pace
BE different, be strange
Be huggers, be fireflies
Non-stop, NOstagia
(Woooooooo)
To be hated, to be vacant
It's 99 niggas, shit, I know you're tying up
So next year we can do it all over again
Here's my number, baby, don't lose it
It's full of smoke in this motherfucker as we sail
And Eastside niggas are the bleakest (bleakest)
You are what you smoke, nigga stop hating
That's why you broke up and that's why we celebrate
But life is so hard on a G, that's what everyone says
And Betty said Eddie is fed up
Sweaty in bed with a nine on his head
And the fucking with this hoodrat that he met at the dance
Betty gets mad because Eddie wants to share
But watch how you live for a minute and then compare
I'm ready to do now, who now, you now
You have to do a better way
(You have to do a better way)
Better days ahead
I went out and got mine, can you feel me?
Better days ahead my nigga
Here's the love bible for you
Because they say I'm skinny and tall
But, uh, I'm that nigga who's going to kick the real ones
And, big bitches, this is how I feel
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
I used to get mad and nervous
But that's not what the rumor was about
Because one day maybe I wouldn't laugh
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
You have a big mouth (I can't forget you)
You have a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
Now I understand what they are talking about
A big mouth, a big mouth
You have a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
And every time I see you it's no use
Lick these nuts and suck your cock
Now while I'm shooting with my black Dre and Eastwood
Flip flops and we serve hoes like lapel cats
You already run on their hoes and grab the cash
And start running
While you relax, with your friends and that shit
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Snoop Doggy Dogg paginated, that must mean more hoes
But I'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes
How can you trust a hoe? (Why?)
I used to be in his guts like every day
So I guess blacks wouldn't stumble over mine
Guess what? I was surprised once
6 months on my chest, now it's time to rescue
My black D.O.C. and my homey Dr. Dre
Picked up in a coupe, Snoop we have news
I haven't been away for a second
Look at my girl's house, Dre, pass the Glock
But she and I know that they can't fade this
Motherfucker need to back off, hell yeah
I don't give a shit
Knows it all
I'm in the current ho
But they can't hang out with my type og swing
(Where are you? West Coast, Los Angeles)
Bringing it live, Dr. Dre, what
Throwing a big ass W
Glass and metal in all directions.
As long as we leave gangsta shit
Lincoln Continental
(I pimp these hoes, nigga, ha ha) Ask the bitches in your hood because they know
We came looking for the damn cheese
Hem my coat, and roll me some dope (Fo 'real)
So a nigga like me, shit, I don't lose
You've been waiting for a black man like me (What is that?)
And make fun and shit about names
Set the stage
Grab the meter
Daddy no
Think you can't
Yes, he will do it
Side representative
Nine to five
Serve a set
Why won't we do it?
Best best
Oh, what do you think it says?
We got niggas getting shizzot
Graduated at .38, now I'm hard
159th street is where I'm hanging
A [?] And dogg carrying heat? Nigga, bets
But they know very well that they want to defeat us and deceive us
Every corner that I turn and every city that I'm in
Every time I make a point to spit it rhymes with my pen
I get out bustin 'and exploding the Dogg Pound way
In this game I'm alone with my back to the wall
Do you have a hunnid? I have a bad monster in it
Since everything is at stake because I guess he got a hoe for a nigga
Inclined, supported
Hoes try to reach a nigger, the security screen
We have dem G's, only C's, no fleas
We are the epitome of rap, D-O-double-G's
World, DPG, catastrophic, D-O-double-G, you know
Outsiders
You know you know
It hadn't been for the Lord who was on my side
The back was against the wall.
He heard my cry and rescued me
Don't assume we're here today
Never let a day go by and don't realize it
What the devil means to evil
I only know that we are blessed and highly favored
It could have been me
It should have been me
Favored-favored
Favored-favored
I am blessed and highly favored
It's a C-Walk contest, who does it better?
However, really, king of the hill
(Me and me, me and me, me and my niggas) Rollin '
This is a bell day, nigga, what a good day
Meditating, contemplating the way we crush them
(Me and me, me and my niggas)
(Me and me, me and me, me and my niggas) Rollin '
(Me and me, me and me, me and my niggas) Rollin '
(Me and me, me and me, me and my niggas) Rollin '
(Me and me, me and me, me and my niggas) Rollin '
I'm shooting like it just started
I am very far from Locus Ave, my crazy people have
(Me and me, me and me, me and my niggas) Rollin '
Drinking from this genuine Miller eraser
Ra, ra, rolling, rolling
Look when you think when everyone tells you
See, he's the only one that prolly really helps you
Just believe (just believe)
Oh-woah (blessing me again and)
He's blessing me again, yeah (he's blessing me again)
My grandmother used to always tell me "you will be a reverend"
Over and over again
You are blessed entering
Everything you have is blessed without a doubt (it's blessing me again)
Yes
Blowing chronic for me, it's like a tradition for me
We could do it all together like Bobby Brown and Whitney
Bob Marley reincarnated, pupils dilated
I'm buzzing high, sliding, sliding
I have to listen to Snoop and now you feel paralyzed
You got some hoes in your truck and now you're ready to fuck
Because it's no fun, if friends can't get any
Do you want to smoke with me (Do you want?)
You should smoke with me
My condition has been the worst since I introduced
Set it aside, so when your child hits the east side
I'm looking for the firefied cheefa
Aiyyo Pharrell, give me that VA discount
Because we always play the correct note
(It surprises me)
And that's for life my nigga
Haha, Gangsta Gumpo
Look at him, look at him - Daz is coming
And there will be no more waiting
And there will be no more waiting
You could be shooting, inna de place
For my bulls in Philly, because all they smoke is phillies
Now really, will you ever slip or trip?
I spit the vocabulary to sink MC's like ships
With my night vibes and editorial clips
I got a click, it will hit you like a thousand volts
Listen and stay away from verbal contact
When a black has to fight for his, he can't stop
I have to get somewhere
In ninety-six, with a different approach to shit
When the Tek connects with you
They are trained to kill, beyond the raped area
When the smoke clears the area if I'm toasted (?) Or at home
So respect is what I hope, the money drove me
Glock .45 caliber gat, gun or pistol
When we burst, I let myself go
I'm stomping, stomping, with my projectile gun
And these MCs will be G's
And who wants to compete with Techniec?
And what you say when I show
(Watch out, nigga!)
I just bought a Birkin bitch, she loved it (she loved it)
Surround the city with your bitch, lil 'nigga
Blue chucks on your damn rug (rug, ayy, ayy)
Long Beach Blue Chip certified (Blue Chip)
Eastside nigga bang and rolling
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it (Ayy, fuck it)
Left pocket, blue rag (blue rag)
I said to a black man: "Be careful" (Be careful)
Now we're in the back, trampled
Angry niggas, I've been in charge for years and I'm still on
I just bought a Benz and I love it (and I love it)
I just bought a Birkin bitch, she loved it (she loved it)
He has money, because he has money
YG (4Hunnid!)
Boom!
In pursuit, come rock with Snoop
Baby is a lawyer, his body is the truth (cute)
I'm the big dog, better be careful
You come with me, if you stop and look
Providing, lodging
Talk to them T-pain
I'll do whatever it takes, however I want! (I want!)
La, la la la
Really speaking, the suites are as follows
What are you trying to drink? Sure or yak?
Boom!
Boom shakalaka when it falls, oh I'll have her saying
Boom!
I have five different varieties, have you ever tried Purple Rain?
Boom!
Baby, I'm a dog! (I'm a dog!) Watch out! (beware!)
La, la la la
Boom shakalaka when it falls, oh I'll have her saying
Boss Playa ... Boss Playa
Skin at stake, church
But I'm sure you want to know about this pimp game (pimp game)
And to me you know it's not a fucking shit
Hello to them, Doggy Dogg, go and do that
And dedicated to his role, Je-sus!
And if those boys of the law stop it, it won't freeze
I'll take the strongest, you can have the weakest
And by the way I was waiting for you
To give it to you plain and simple because you know it's playing
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" as my nigga Pootie Tang
I had to catch my breath, watch my step
It's like an art the way I articulate
But I'm sure you want to know about this pimp game (pimp game)
Would you lie to me (Never)
Would you die for me? (When)
Will you kill for me? (Yes, I will do it)
You have to go see the magician ... to get yourself some heart
That's the game ... for them lame
Many people don't know about this pimp game (pimp game)
Hello to them Doggy Dogg, go and do that
I got that bounce, to make your loot swing
Always in their stores, with great prostitutes.
Wet Cristal, you like to get wild
Now this is for B and C, and D and H
Understanding how I'm living, show them hoes how you're winning
They want to get me out of the place, they want the pussy and the ends
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Look at me man, I'm nothing like you
I'm leaning on my journey, for the fifth, hitting my dick
Khaki's and them Timbs and they niggas with platinum mouths
Thinking that they were blessed by the actions that will come out
Just put the key on her, nigga, if she's fighting
You can have her and her partner, fucking her for a dolla
But I would never bother breaking the Doggfather
Walking on the blue carpet with the Doctor
I have a little arrogance that you're not used to
I'm living that boss's life
You can have anything, don't fuck with my money
Woman: already baby
Woman: already baby
Then squeeze the brakes, hoes
You could talk all day behind my back, but you wouldn't say shit on my face
Carla, Darla, Charlene and Camina
But I could give a shit because all my hoes
On the days that I was on the block
You remind me of this bitch that used to work for me
And he tried to confront me in a club one night
As Kiki did to me, the bitch changed the locks
And kicked me out of place
She said she needed a partner
While she was at work working
And fucking all her friends who were flirting
Bitch, you ain't shit but ground for ground (biotch!)
This is a sexy bitch
Breathe in, breathe out
Itch ga ga, you have bush
AK-47, not that train crash
If it's not the Cali, then it must be the hay hay
You got the woo wop bag, so don't start that
Relax and relax while D.O.D. did
Now hit that, light that up and bring that shit back
L.A. unified, add that under
In these times of hate and pain.
We need a remedy to help us in the rain.
Fuck you niggas, think you can fuck with me
Make a pimp want to go back
Bitch, and fuck that
Trying to break the bitch but you say "I will"
So she could smell the big girls
Make a black man disappear like Jimmy Hoffa (Where is he?)
Look at your mouth, look at your mouth
It's a clear blue sky here on the east side (east side)
I'm talking shit, holding my dick
So you don't believe (hoes in amazement)
Niggas go away all the time
Let's make a muthafuckin 'movie
You know man
Do you already dig?
Yes
Damn this shit sounds lower than a motherfucker in my headphones
As soon as the bass touches your dome
Shooting rhymes like a gun
This ho, that ho makes me rich
Cause actually, I'm chasing you like the toughest nigga we know
I am not willing to lose but to get my chips
And crush, spend with cash
You ran and they served you, ha ha
Come on
Dirty or clean, black, money is all green
Give it back, you know me
Every nigga looks the same behind a cap
I husband their hands and the blind, their eyes and pigs tie their feet
Nigga where your friends now, half of them niggas fun style
Puppy to catch him now cause you better sit
Nigga what's up now, you act like a bitch
You're bound to be fucked snitch ass trick
You need to get up from that shit
Every nigga looks the same behind a cap
Niggas in the hood is still broken and can't fix it
Another smoke session on this motherfucker
Some of that gangsta shit (east side)
But as for me
Just G when I'm buss'n rocks
I was a fucking madman
I shake niggas
Because if not, it's on
They call it Snoop Capone
Smoking an area
But I wasn't slipping, I was on deck
I'm laughing at this shit because it was funny
And no one will speak at 8-7
Where the bitches and the bud break free
And everyone listen to the D-O double G
But I'll put it on the ride to make me green
You know the amazing baby from my game (uh uh, uh uh)
Cadillacs, croker bags
You can't be a snitch, don't be a bitch, nigga, make your name
501's, golf hats and policies
Playing quarterback and it's a must that I stezart
And I'm a fool on the point like a dezart
Half of my friends are dead or in jail.
Cadillacs, croker bags
501's, golf hats and policies
I will see, friends are deep
501's, golf hats and policies
Shoe shit, yeah nigga, I'm on it
For the tippy, keep it so crispy
Smoke a whole zippy, put bread on the Skippy
The real G fucks me
West coast motherfuckers get up
Zip, yes
You can't be a snitch, don't be a bitch, nigga, make your name
So G, it's me, LBC
Palm trees, politics, a lot of grass
Hear them say that
I will be single
The way you do it like this
Oh baby
Like a summer in California
Something about your love drives me crazy
Your love leads me to ecstasy
Oh baby
Oh baby
Something about your love drives me crazy
Where they love HB to K
I was like three watching Snoop on the screen
Something about your love drives me crazy
Baby, you could be a movie star, hey (in Los Angeles)
Because this is how California rolls
Say when that grass happens to you and I ask you if
Let's hit Adidas, we got our own toes
And if you want to go downtown
You could also roll with real black
I'm talking about you and me
Get a medical card, yes (in Los Angeles)
You can do it in a light blue box, yeah (in Los Angeles)
Rodeo with a winner, Rodeo resting
I'm talking about you and me
In a rose in that valley
But I'm not talking about the news

Excuse me very quickly, thanks
Hello Hello
Yes Yes
Hey, how are you mom?
I, sorry, don't have it now
But I was praying that maybe ...
I was caught in a mess
The rental man wants his money, the bill must be paid
So now I'm calling Jesus
Tryna figure out how, you brought me through many [?]
Because I know where my health comes from
Jesus Jesus
Just like you mean it
Not a problem, call Jesus right away
Woah, yeah, calling him right now
Jesus, always by my side
Call him when my days are hard
Call him at midnight
When your paper is funny
Somebody call him
Just call him and he will answer
You love them? Got them, dripping like water
Yola, (ewwww!) Caramel ice cream (What does she do?)
Man, that shit will be useful
(Ewwww!) It's a real walkie talkie (What else?)
If you want them, I have them; If you're here for the police, you better lean on
The sweets I sell call it deez nutz
European Front with French Fries
You love them? Got them, dripping like water
You love them? Got them, dripping like water
Here comes that sugar daddy, nigga, rollin on golden thangs
You love them? Got them, dripping like water
You love them? Got them, dripping like water
Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frosty colored switches
He is the number one player in the United States.
Man I don't give a shit like "Fuck it"
I have the perfect thang that will cover your throat (Candy!)
You love them? Got them, dripping like water
Sometimes I feel lost as a fugitive, I read more
Burning bullet point, flying down at sunset
I see you all praying for a G. to drop
Trippin off hate, not Hee-Haw
All the black locs on the locomotive act like I don't see them all
I left, suddenly hip-hoppin?
Sheeit, drink the gin, so I'm in the wind
So strong but slim black
Rappers keep saying Slim so Shady but they're not talking about Eminem
To a garage for three cars, instant kitchenware is
Vintage, relentless, I mean this, I promise
Nigga! So buzz about that shit
Fuck this rap shit!
Something to break the New Year, do you dig? [echo]
Come on everyone, let's rock this place
Let's say I rejected her because I wouldn't kiss her
But I got him a picture saying I'm gonna go back to holla with (I'm going to holla)
Divide into tongue twisters we buy realists
We care about my lists because I'm a mimsta
Design by mimstas these times are senistas
Oh, was I there? Oh yeah, spitting to turn you over
Pigs won't pinch us, they won't just miss us
So make your wish list and go ahead and do this (Preaching)
Follow the bouncing ball
Warm me up
I am a man, I have to take care of my family
I can't say goodbye (to the hood)
Goodbye (to the blocks)
I know that since I left it has gotten worse
But I'd still be there if I couldn't write a verse
But if you think that the old me ever left
I have a beautiful wife and beautiful children
But it wouldn't be right if I ignored the shit
They say leave the streets but they really don't understand
CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
I can't say goodbye
Charlie: I can't say goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Hitting the grass, hunting late at night
Combating these pressures in my life
But if they think the old me is gone then they really don't know me
CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
Combating these pressures in my life
They made me as I am, music in man
They say the streets of leaders but they really don't understand
I can't say goodbye
I can't say goodbye
You got the kind of bitch that'll kick your ass
All I see are simpetttes
Even if it's slapping her in the face
But, bitch, you're playing with fire
I am so sick and tired
You have to control your ho ..
A xxxxx is a bitch, either poor or rich
She still has a gang of cocks
It doesn't matter what you do or say
Because xxxxx you can't change my feelings in any way
I could shake a boy like Dame and run
Bouncin (bouncin) bouncin (swervin)
Light a whole ounce and get the ramen with the cotton candy.
Yes, and all the xxxxxxx say ... ride
Yes, and all the thieves say ... ride (they can't catch them)
Nine millimeters, how about Big Nate
She lives in the north of the state, and I don't think
Homemaker quickly jumps to four pounds
It's what I had in mind, get paid
Is it a fucking soccer game or a soccer team or something?
Is the xxxx wrong with these niggas?
Xxxx your crew is in use I take your Brome
You know, when I was xxxxxx with the hood
And make a wish, ha ha
I had to make room between us
Now you're looking at a different me
Excuses every Sunday
Appears every weekend
I hear a train coming
I have been acquitted
Phenzel
Ike, what's up?
When Doggy Dogg comes
When Doggy Dogg comes
You better answer
We all like to live it)
Verse 2
So I suggest you rearrange
Because the change is gone, come
Take it to daddy rap because he's a pro
(I feel like giving up
We all like to live it)
Look what I'm facing
Of all the judges give this
And put it in perspective all the praise due right
Where anything can go at any time
How do I think I left?
Have they been misleading since I asked everyone to crawl with me?
Deathrow doggystyle holding west
And I took off for a choke, most kept my G out a toast
When Doggy Dogg comes
You better answer
You better answer
You better answer
You better answer
When Doggy Dogg comes
And bring the word to the people here on the streets
You can hear it, it's the spirit
What I can do
Oh shit, is that Snoop over there? Oh shit
Man fuck that nigga
Hey look Sam man, I have to go pee, I'm coming back
Yes aight
Get this Henny touch in my vein
Yo Snoop, you know I love your shit, you're so good to me
You know the name of the game, your bitch chose me
So what happens black?
And you know what I'm doing, get it to the west coast
Twice you know what I'm talking about
Yes, Ice Cube, Das EFX, check Yo Self before tearing you apart

You better check yourself before shipwreck (Yes)
Real talk lil homie, finna check your silly car
Because I'm bad for your health, I come really stealthy
However, for our sets, always let them know the tricks
And no, I'm not the butler, I'll cut you
Here to let you know boy, oh boy
This is not any kind of movie
I have a trick, the friend gets
Come on and behave yourself well before you screw up
Because shotgun bullets are bad for your health
Chickity-check, yes
Because they did tricks, pulling out a razor
But a constant mess talking in the holding tank
And now they run in your slow
Chickity-check, yes
I'm 6, and I'm writing them down
Giving applause and who needs applause?
Because tricks like you are bad for my health
So come on and check it out before tearing yourself apart
Chizzy-check yourself before you tear yourself apart
Come check it out before you screw it up
Celestial father
Give me power
About temptation
A kind of known for wild
They taught me to face anyone, anywhere, for anything
Pray for me
We already knew that I needed someone to save my soul
Let it chisel away
He is working on me
Jesus
You have realized?
By the temptation of man
Open your hands
welcome to the party
I'm glad you did it
I'm telling you now
But your attitude and your state of mind
Don't bite off more than you can chew, boy
Let it chisel away
Let it chisel away
He is working on me

Introduction:
All right, that's a very good profession.
You're there in that black shirt, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Hey, you're in the back with those French braids, what's your name?
Oh, but it's very difficult to turn your back on a place
I made a lot of friends, a lot of money
I've come down a few times but it never stopped my rhyme
A war is shown in wolves free of mass, this is how a player shoots
Here is a very good reason to show love
But you have to separate the adult man from the adult bully
At the keys to the whole city bowling in the Snoops league
Don't judge me, you only knew Snoopy
Like crazy, I earned my respect
Don't worry about your circumstances
Haler you are the Snoopy
I paid my dues
There is a time and a place for everything
I paid my dues
Don't worry about your circumstances
I know, they could tell you
We [?] Are both saved
Come on, come as you are (Come as you are)
And praise the Lord together
I know, because the preacher is not coming
So no matter what people say, let's just go
Just come as you are (Come as you are)
Just come as you are (Come as you are) (yes) (Come as you are) (Oh) Over here, you have a voice (come on, it's your voice)
Let's make the world so much better
There is room for everyone (yes it is)
Why we sing this song
It will be fine, it will wash all your sins
You're never far away
It doesn't matter if you're from the street
Just come as you are (Come as you are) (oh yeah)
Just come as you are (Come as you are) (Come as you are)
I'm my Kurupt bitch, and I'm a rider
Serve your cock as a snack
Tasty as shit
I told you, I see you Feenin as Jodeci
It's Dat Nigga Daz, bitch, did you notice me?
When we relax in the back bitch
Then what do you want to do? (You want to do?)
And I want to fuck you
Anything can happen from the way these hoes act
Look all I see is ass, and I hit him from behind
I told you to go with me
A piece of mind
It is hard to find
No no no no no no
From the side
As you like
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
Come to my room
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
Inside let me run
Come to my room
But tell me; what good is a man
Because here, mom doesn't have, and dad doesn't have
How God blessed the child who can go find his own
And we fight a lot, we suffer a lot, I feel that this life is a journey
But for them they can hold on to the end and win
Just go talk to Go-ooooood
And some mornings you don't even want to get out of bed
Just go talk to Go-ooooood, hmmm
Niggas out of bounds should have rocked
Let's go for the book
I used to love niggas, now I connect niggas
And slug niggas, am I wrong?
SO! We watch the other two die slowly
My lyrics are all cowardly hip-hop
When We Ride On Our Enemies
Which of you motherfuckers said fuck Tech N9ne
"Allah hu akbar" - is what I say before I bend you
Prepare to suffer - kneel down
Look at my eyes - when I pull the trigger
Look, I was just talking to Biggie.
Fuck you and get carried away by the fucking Outlawz
Before I go make sure everyone has listened
Just left a ball, I know you've heard of me, you want to kill me
Now the west coast mafia regime and the thug zellin 'Nigga
2Pac - I started with poetry, writing poetry
Police - How did you get into rap?
Police - What would you call what you were doing?
2Pac - No!
Police - The following statement is a "Real Victim": "They really beat me up, I really don't like the police"
Police - That's right, "after allegedly listening": they said they were listening to your music
Police, and that's what made them do it ...
Police: from the fans?
Police - And did you respond to that?
Police - Any other?
2Pac - No!
Police - Tell us what!
Okay, okay, let me see how I'm going to hit you. Do you want to light it?
I'm afraid to do some freestyle
But now I'm back to let these niggas know how deep
So everyone wants to smile and raise their hands
I have a razor, in case I have to make necks
Money, hoes and clothes
A flying guy, well damn, I'm a tall Bed-Stuy guy
The Story On September 7, 1996, Tupac Shakur attended the boxing match between Bruce Seldon and Mike Tyson with Suge Knight. After the game, they attacked a cripple and went to Club 662 in the 1996 black BMW 750iL sedan with other cars behind as well. At 11:15, a late-model white four-door Cadillac pulled up to the right side of Tupac's car, swooping down the window, and started firing. Tupac was sent to the hospital and died 7 days later.
Hard head and hot head, bull head and pig head
This is Destiny, yeah, money I'm running from
The only DJ who can calm me down is constantly armed
My firepower keeps me warm, I'm constantly armed
See niggas is fake, sitting in court, snitches
That used to be real, but now they were petrified bitches
I'm trying to be strong, my fire power keeps me warm
I'm caught up in the storm, and fuck the world until I'm gone, bitches are warned
And then it lights up, before you let me imagine
Fuck me, have a hundred motherfuckers in your 'do', with fo
Now I could work miracles with cool hoes
Just because they pay me the worst way? True!
It looks good in your birthday outfit
I wonder if you are wild and shy.
Me let's stop pretending and be real now
Chief player when I go out, that's correct
They like me
I can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out of the cookie jar
And I will never reject some Oreos if you have them
Double stuf or fine mint
I want to be faithful
I am a beast because they are sweets
From head to toe, they're so sweet
Lyrical command, (Let's put it)
I turn the track into a Roman candle
One in the bedroom
From birth until they die
I never would have dreamed in a million years I would see
In no particular direction, only aerosols and aerosols
And now they say I'm in trouble with the government, I love it
I got into shit all my life, and now I'm throwing it away
Tell me baby, what's your frequency?
Niggas ain't ready to see me paid
They prefer to take mine
Retaliation takes time
Creating rhymes so fierce that the bass line
Niggas is scared, I'm forever hitting
(* machine gun fires)
Caught me on the vanishing point, now punk is in deep shit
Quickly going up the streets, it's the punk police
I put him on his knees and shot him: punk, please.
Now back to the smoker who stole from me
Two very bloody bodies on the streets.
And any motherfucker with the flim-flam falls to the knot
Ten o'clock, it's a damn gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin 'weight the shit is really smooth
By a crooked motherfucker named Stretch
Yes, don't stop!
Twisted Ass Niggas
When I'm rolling with my crew, watch what the crooked niggas do!
I have a nine millimeter Glock pistol
It is best to bring a knot or be busted, I am a soldier
As long as I have a clip, I got some shit to hit them
Criminal behavior)
(Suddenly I see some niggas I don't like)
(Suddenly I see some niggas I don't like)
(Suddenly I see some niggas I don't like)
Criminal be- crim-crim-crim-crim-crim--
(Got him)
I 'Pac
Please tell me what a nigga to do, and it's true
It's not new, so I do what I can to get through
A loaded AK-47 lying on my hips to avoid tripping
Make it hard for me to sleep
But now I'm pointing a finger at the police
And when punk motherfuckers stumble, I shit too
It all depends on you, but until then I have to do what I do
You can't fuck with the crew, crooked nigga too
Fuck be meek, light a flame, time to aim triggers
Time to take on the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
That's my damn brother, so Dave Duke, run to hide
They know they are afraid to see us sober
It all depends on you (depends on you)
And it's still a crooked black too
And maybe then you will see the truth; OOOH!
And maybe then you will see the truth; OOOH!
Because I? Play as Jasmine Guy and try me
And nuttin but love for each other
That's when they get gas
You can't fuck with the crew, crooked nigga too
But until then I have to do what I do and still be a crooked nigger too
You can't fuck with the crew, crooked nigga too
I'm going to say what I'm going to say
I will say what I say
And we're not shooting at each other
That's my damn brother, so Dave Duke, run to hide
Come feel the wrath of a black man who doesn't smoke crack and
I'm going to live as I live, how do you want a black to live?
Temperatures drop; I see that it's great to shoot a nigger
I will do what i do
It is the coldest city from here to Georgia.
It is the coldest city from here to Georgia.
It is the coldest city from here to Georgia.
I'm going to live as I live, how else do you want a black man to live?
I will do what i do
... in the thugs mansion
I don't know, it's hard to continue when nobody loves you
My friends and I have no choice but to move on
I will see you when you get there
See you when you get there
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it made me shiver
Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then a lady named Billie Holiday sang
Maybe in time you will understand that only God can save us
When Miles Davis loses to the band
Just think of all the people you met in the past
A pretty and healthy baby found crying in the trash
Walk your dog, she pees on the sidewalk
Everyone is afraid, leaves the body bleeding
I see you used to laugh or grab her choked ass
Dangerous times, dangerous days, dangerous nights.
Secondary in '86 and '87
They were 38 years old, in 94 they are Mack's 11
I think the world is ending, and AIDS is the plague
Her children left and even got to a man still
Go to school, go to the movies, go to the club, go to the store
In these fucked up times they have no remorse in
Without eye contact, we want to lead you astray
So you know I'm back dro
I forgot, I was lurking in the red zone
It's time for danger
Niggas all on my phone talking important shit
I'm more lost, running away from the police force
Open fire on them bitches if they stumble
Go baby scream to god he can't hear you
Go baby scream to god he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast because it's time to die
Reaching observation time fly
Get high watching the time fly
Niggas call the police, people shoot, no one stops
I wonder when the world stopped worrying
Last night two children shot while the whole block stared
Even bullies have to learn to take it easy
Listen, through the intermediates, find a plan in your heart
Look, I don't see anything but my dreams come true
I can feel your heart beating fast because it's time to die
Getting high, watching the time fly
Looking at the world through my rearview mirror
Now I was raised as a young black man
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Heavenly Father, I am a soldier
Talk to my weapons like flies
Looking at the world through my rearview mirror
Come on, baby, shout to God, he can't hear you
And all my motherfuckers
The lyrics of this song have not yet been released. Check back once the song has been released.
I have to come to an end, so business goes down
Though hunted as a fugitive, those punks will never capture me
TEC-9 on my side, oh stay behind me
So they won't wear me shorts when the shit gets scandalous
I'm living like a mack, the narcist will be minimal
Born in the days of a criminal, born in the days of a criminal
Bitch, I'm a beach, I don't have time to bother
Not having babies in long-term relationships
Cause she'll blow up my pager before I close the door
I took a puff, I had enough now, wait
You think no, let them drop, we can handle this
I never trip over your bitch 'cause she's outrageous
(all in the days of a criminal) (born in the days of a criminal)
(criminal, criminal, criminal) (born in the days of a criminal)
(criminal, criminal, criminal) born in the days of a
(born in the days of a criminal)
(criminal, criminal, criminal)
I am hard, Jehovah said he was excluded from the pearly gates
Our father, my bursts caught drug stains
A shot next to the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shitting
Niggas still stressed, the same damn question
How many shots does it take to make my heart stop?
And my body begins to shake, Ron G, for rest
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
See niggas is fake, sit in court, snitches
I'm trying to be strong, they send armies to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ who can calm me down
Constantly armed, my firepower keeps me warm
I'm caught in the storm, and I fuck the world until I'm gone
Bitches are warned: the word is a bond, they will break you
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
I'm going to Roc-a-Fella as Shawn Carter
Hot rhyme, sparkling diamonds, autograph signature
My lifestyle is far
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
Ron J is not a fucking joke
You are appreciated
Isn't there a living woman who can take my mom's place?
I finally understand
It is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Lady, don't you know that we love you? (Dear Mama)
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I don't have a heart, but all the time
I stayed with the bullies
You're in the kitchen, trying to fix us a hot plate
You only work with the leftovers they gave you
And mom did miracles every Thanksgiving
To keep me happy, there is no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
And even though I act crazy
You never kept a secret, you were always real
It's a fight every day, I have to keep going
And there is no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Sweet lady, don't you know we love you? (Dear Mama)
Seventeen years, expelled in the streets.
Isn't there a living woman who can take my mom's place?
Mom catch me put a shriek on my butt
You say the words that can refocus me
It is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Mom ... (Dear Mom)
Seventeen years, expelled in the streets.
With the big boys breaking all the rules
We were poorer than the other little boys
You were always a black queen, mom
I finally understand
Dear Mom ... (You are appreciated)
Mom, yeah ...
He passed away and I didn't cry because my anger
I stayed with the bullies
They showed love to a young brother
I moved in and really started hanging up
I needed my own money, so I started slandering
And mom did miracles every Thanksgiving
It is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Mom ... (Dear Mom)
Dear Mom ... (just so you know, you are appreciated)
You say the words that can refocus me
And even though I act crazy
It is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
You are appreciated
She was always a black queen, mom
With the big boys breaking all the rules
We were poorer than the other little boys
Would I see the prison someday?
Mom catch me put a shriek on my butt
You were always engaged
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
Lady, don't you know that we love you? (Dear Mama)
You wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I don't have a heart, but all the time
I was looking for a father, he was gone
I hope you have the diamond necklace that I sent you
It is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
And all the extra love you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
Sweet lady (she was always a black queen)
Lady (she was always a black queen)
(She was always a black queen, mom)
Lady, don't you know that we love you?
Over the years we were poorer than the other little children
When things went wrong, we would blame mom
Huggin on my mom from a jail cell
And even like a crack demon, mom
You were always a black queen, mom
I finally understand
It is not easy for a woman to try to raise a man
You were always engaged
But the plan is to show you that I understand
(Dear Mama)
They say I'm wrong and I don't have a heart, but all the time
I was with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
I am not guilty because, although I sell rocks
And you never left me alone because you loved me
And I could see you come home after work late
(And dear mom)
Oh mom i appreciate you
When I was sick like a little boy
You're full of all the sweet things you did for me
And I appreciate how you raised me
If you can spend the night there is a brighter day
Everything will be fine if you hold on
Oh mom i appreciate you
Although my shadow is gone
I love you
I need you
With the big boys breaking all the rules
Hugging my mom from a jail cell
And even like a crack demon, mom
Lady, don't you know that we love you? (Dear Mama)
Now nobody tells us it was fair
And I could see you come home after work late
Sweet lady, don't put anyone on top of you
(Just so you know, you are appreciated)
You say the words that can refocus me
And even though I act crazy
And all the extra love you gave me
Sweet lady, don't you know we love you? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?
Crichlow! (A 5991301)
Close five! Going down!
My friends at home in Clinton and Rikers Island
Mumia, Mutulu, Geronimo, Sekon
All political prisoners
San Quentin (who can save you) ... all prisons
I'm with you
You are listening to the sounds of ...
I get up early in the morning, so military mentality
Was it me, the grass or this life that I lead?
See you in the cemetery dressed in black
So if I die, do the same for me, don't shed tears
Come rush me to the gates of heaven, let me imagine for a while
Livin fast, too fast ...
Lyrically snatching pockets, suckers flea when they notice
I have a cell in the pen waiting for me. Is this my destiny?
Do you miss me with that misdemeanor thinking, I fall?
Never that, too much tequila drinking, we are all that
Watch me paint a perfect vision, this life we live
Saying "Please show a beach love" hold your head!
The grass made me pinch my mind, I'm thinking ...
God bless the child who can hold on
Currency doesn't mean anything if you're not free yet
Take the grass, have a drink, read a book
I wouldn't be a damn thang without a woman
Hugging my mom from a jail cell
Would I see the prison someday?
And even like a crack demon, mom
You were always engaged
What did you say about my mother, man?
He passed away and I didn't cry because my anger
I was with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed love to a young brother
I love paying the rent when the rent is due
Because when I was low, you were there for me
(Dear Mama)
I wouldn't be a damn thang without a woman
What did you say about my mother, man?
I can always depend on my mom
And when it seems that I have no hope
You say the words that can refocus me
And all my childhood memories
There are no words that can express how I feel.
What did you say about my mother, man?
What did you say about my mother, man?
Mom told me there would be days like this
Mom told me there would be days like this
Mom told me there would be days like this
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't eat
I expect retaliation in a hurry
Trying to stay calm, nobody lives forever
Fighting and fighting, my destiny is to die
("When we were kids, belonging felt good ..")
("But having respect, that feels even better ...")
I see death around the corner, the pressure is affecting me
My friend once said to me, don't you trust them?
And even if he died young, who would care
("But having respect, that feels even better ...")
("When we were kids, belonging felt good ..")
Drinking liquor from my mom's tit
I have friends who will hunt you until you fall
("But having respect, that feels even better ...")
I see death around the corner
This is for all the real fucking niggas
If any of you ..
I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead!
Because they are bragging, telling the bastards in jail, I just pumped
Got a little static for some niggas across town
So just before you die you bow to a bigga nigga now wipe your eyes
Watch me have an attack on stage, you don't feel good, hell
Tell me, will my niggas cry for me?
A man of military means in my artillery.
I really didn't believe until I was shot that no black person would shoot me
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
I never know if this game will last, feeling ashamed
"Nobody closing me from my business"
I'm not in love with her, I just want to be the one to hit her
Drop down and let the next nigga catch her
Break a ho when it's time to do something else
And spitting the game out on my cell phone
"What are you doing'?"
In a one-bedroom cabin, and kicking
Daydreaming with the nine in my lap (huh)
Before I go bankrupt I'll be a drug dealer, a Thug Nigga
I keep my hand on my cat and I stay cool, my attitude sucks
Happy in the motherfucker, he finally made it
I'm just trying to make some money
"Mob-mobbin 'like a motherfucker every day"
"It is the season, to serve"
"It is the season ... to serve"
(Warren G fucking with that nigga)
Cutting you off your wing and knocking on the door, I'm not waiting
Black fitted cap on the back with Gap jeans on the knees
For my tactics, chin control like the box, I want it all
Start leaving rounds
Then escape into the mist
Now they really want to see
West Side!
So the short curse of the bomb is the curse of the bomb of the bomb
It is mental temptation, mental murder.
And living off Brother Lichter, I'm ready to disconnect you
Point of no return and now my life is on the edge
But I'll catch you when I try to escape
West side for life
Biaaaaaatch!
It's time to run
So kneel before your fucking knees and feel this 45 fade you away
Loveless, pumping slugs like I'm serving dogs
With
ROW OF DEATH, WESTERN
Get into these niggas, to fucking death
I take the figure of 30 niggas that caught me
Murder my friends, build a new gang
Bustin 'caps on Jay Z and still avoids capture
I'm yelling "Death row!" Throw away my Westside, it's nothing
We claim mafia. CROWD. if you are specific
We control ALL cash from the Atlantic, Pacific
And get this. I'm hard to kill
Father. How the hell did I survive? these five shots?
WE ALL GO OUT!
Death to you traitors, shots biting your bones like a crocodile
Paying my debts. looking for miscellaneous infamous crews
But sometimes, I slip a little, shit, I'm not afraid to admit it
And I felt good when I was young but game time is up
And I get out of jail
And to hell with a peace treaty, never call him, because he wouldn't feed me
WE, THE FIRST WE LOOKED FOR, WHO DO WE TRUST? OUT OF DEEP MOBB AND JAY Z, DEAD
The dust
SEARCHED ALL, ALL LEAVING
(OUTLAW, DEATHROW, MAKAVELI THA DON OUTLAWZ THE CRIMINAL)
(DESPERADO'S, WESTSIDE THUG LIVIN ')
(Haha mobb deep, lil juvenile delinquent young ass)
Puffy, BANG, you're dead
Mmh, die, die slowly
But I can't help but walk away, just throw it away
I hear you call me to come back, I'm a suck for love
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
I don't want to fall for that, but in this case, what could I do? So now i'm back
I'm about to lose my composure, I'm getting closer
Tell me who knows, a quiet place where I can go
My heart says go away, oh what a tangle of cloth we weave
You get calls in the house, I guess you cheat
You tried everything, but you don't give up
I'm on the phone with secret conversations, huh?
What you won't do, (do it for love)
Do it for love
Give it more volume
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned on being your man, it just wasn't me
I can't breathe, because as soon as I leave, it's like a trap
What you won't do, do it for love
To make you promises, trying to keep it
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holding on
Tell me who knows, a quiet place where I can go
You're getting calls in the house, I guess you're cheating
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and company
I took you to the hills, out of the evils of the ghetto chapel.
I loved to call it mine
I should have seen you was a problem, but I was lost, caught in your eyes
Don't worry about it, we can do it, now I'm under pressure
What you won't do, do it for love
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
You tried everything, but you don't give up
(What you won't do, do it for love)
Piglet for love, piglet for love
Piglet for love
We had some problems but we worked on it, and now
The arguments are getting loud, I want to stay
(Piglet for love, piglet for love)
I don't want to fall for it
I'm about to lose my composure, I'm getting closer
To pack and leave notes, and get ghosts
Tell me who knows, a quiet place where I can go
You're getting calls in the house, I guess you're cheating
That's all I need to hear because I'm leaving, I'm out of the game.
Cause now I know you've been cheating, I'm sucking for love
What you won't do, do it for love
What you won't do, do it for love
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry about it, we can do it, now I'm under pressure
What you won't do, do it for love
What you won't do, do it for love
(Piglet for love, piglet for love)
(Piglet for love, piglet for love)
And baby Bubba, let's keep it real
We swell on Cubans to make it dangerous
How you feel? I'm ready to deal, ride like a villain
Makin 'a killin', thrilling the crowd with my new hairstyle
Who you are You know who I am, young black man
I'm Tha Dogg, Father
Uh come on
I remove them, but don't mistreat them
Let me flow
Just remember when you do your thang
Like them, the white boy DA was on the case
Does anyone in the house remember?
Come on
When there was no Snoop Dogg? (Hell yeah!)
Inside and outside the best hotels
Sales, queues, scales and prisons.
Success before death
How women with the Almighty Father lead
Succeed in giving my tweets what they need
And there's no party like this
Because you can leave your worries behind
I know it took me a while 2 Back
2 U but I'm sure you know how hectic
Timez has been converted lately, but only recognizes
Don't remember that place and the
True & Fakez I ran into. Az 4 me
I'm crying B.I.G. a new ass! :)
Me because you can't C me. Tell my real
2PAC
How the hell can we make money from a nigga like 2Pac?
But you were riding my dick a little bit and you didn't get off
Some are like never having a friend like this
And we can handle it as we should
Don't call me bitch
Let your fat ass pass outrageous bitch
(I talked to the niggas with the most money
Running around saying confidence in a bitch but now I can't
Tryin 'to make a million 14 tracks, so don't start shit
Now you're mad because I won't let you call me a bitch
Don't call me bitch
They paid me, but I'm still faithful to my job
I worked hard like a slave, to flap and rap to the grave
Second best for a long time, critics will prove them wrong
So baby pick a winner, don't die and swear
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Some of you niggas are bitches too
(Do not go to sleep)
Other niggas close their eyes seeing dreams while sleeping
Do not sleep
Stop looking at me like an infrared black
Images of abundance, drinking my glass full of Henny
Hands on my semi-automatic death for pennies
Scared of taking a nap, it's a trap, a long maze
I inhale strong grass, then release stress
Niggas fold when I say it (dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar)
I efficiently erase and run away
You can get your cash on nigga by looking
Other niggas close their eyes seeing dreams while sleeping
You can get your cash on nigga by looking
Other niggas close their eyes seeing dreams while sleeping
Yeah it's just six niggas tattooed
In that as addicts, cabbage hijackers
You can get your cash on nigga by looking
But don't fall asleep (don't go to sleep black)
You can't fall asleep my nigga
Not on death row
Demon by the hundreds, so if I want to, I'm a bully.
Stealing bitches for their riches' cause I'm direct pulling switches
At lunch, Sharin 'a trick, with a blunt chronic fulla
Deep like them Jeep like niggas in the salute
You can get your cash on nigga by looking
Don't go to sleep black
Money on bitches
Do not go to sleep
Chino-X kill ..
You sleep in us
When my Glocks load them, nigga will fall
Images of abundance, drinking my glass full of henny
It is scary to take a nap, it is a trap a long maze
But you can't fuck with his last or the last joint
Pin stripes and gray (uh-huh)
And alligators
Play your position, here comes my intuition
Seeing dreams in them they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Often it's a young black man, in a coffin
Seeing dreams in them they sleep
Seeing dreams in them they sleep
When I enter the first zone, the worst known microphone stand
Separated from his gun and his bitch, and watch them start snorting
I keep spitting, still stupid niggas don't listen
I personify this thug living; Hell or prison
Mark, watch the niggas fall when I call their name
Do not sleep
Dumpin 'on random motherfuckers, quickly
It had to be a damn murder, I'm glad to be
Sleep with your head wide open (your head is smoking)
Yolk the black of the asphalt
Addicted to my nine, moving like a crime through time
Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Do not sleep
When I go outside, all I can see is the routine
Whatever you do shawty better think wisely
I always crawl with the nine when I ride (when I ride)
It's so violent and it destroys everyone, it drives kids crazy
Children kill people
Let's ban all rap music
Why do you think Nas is screaming 'Hip-Hop deceased?
Without justice (without justice)
This outlaw style took a brother off the streets
Did I cry when they dropped me? (nah), can you stop me? (it will not)
This rap game all we have left
Create strategies now we unite brothers on the rise
In no way, how do we get to keep moving
And put it down
Through music we speak to the blocks
Strange as it may seem
I'm on Corey Brooke, he's mistreating my niggas
They will see who I am
Abandoned here in the area.
The cops never heard from you
Catch dead man with the fifth
The real niggas don't stay, they go
This rap game like a robbery
Enemies, sharpen you miss
It is not easy that you want idiot
So baby, are you ready to go?
It is number one at the top of the charts.
For the neighborhood of the least privileged and oppressed
And we, sitting clean in the last edition
This goes to C. Delores Tucker
(Damn rap music, I hate that)
(It is so violent and destroys everyone)
This outlaw style took a brother off the streets
Until we get justice for these corrupt cops on my block
Have a nice trip because you should never have touched me
If I wasn't spitting it would be prison or death
And we can not stop
Do not stop
Stop the music (You really won't stop, haha)
You really don't want to stop - stop
The only thing we have
Because in this every day, yeah
Do not stop
Come in, with the block, I can't stop
I, broke nights to get big, get the place of the rope, hold it tight
Temp this
Who is the next one?
Fear of parole now I'm waiting for death trying to hurt a nation
You really won't stop haha
Do not stop
Stop the music (You really won't stop, haha)
Do not stop
Have a little time for me?
And maybe we will discuss and end all these forgiveness letters
As soon as I get home it's like I got a third grade
But for me, if you really trust me, it's unfortunate
You should stop for a moment
Have a little time for me?
(not that I don't trust you)
It's time for us to take our separate ways
Try to be mature, I'm pretty sure we can handle this
I'll dry your tears, come and hold me
You know I'm emotional, you know me
I can't take the beefin 'and the griefin'
And I can give you more when you mature
You spend all your hours running around
(not that I don't trust you)
Do not trust me?
I have the snacks for some soul food
What is the cause of this emotion?
A brother was a jerk
Because I got caught in the scene
Poor and helpless demon
And I ran out to see ...
So they see who they would know
I almost cried on the spot
And my heart couldn't take it anymore
I felt a tear roll down my face
But she whispered
Then I screamed, someone help me
But I don't think they can hear
And if they did, they didn't care
To get your interviews
And they can't see the tragedy.
Because it is not, it was not his family
And leave the scene as I came here
Late night chilling with my friends
Drinking Hennessey and cold beer
At the local barbecue
And there is nothing more to do.
He said he will spray and he is not kidding
Now i couldn't walk away
Because I got caught in the scene
Poor and helpless demon
(What happens)
Another shot sounds
(What happens)
(What happens)
I ran outside to see the big show
And my heart couldn't take it anymore
But she took it instead.
I tried to push my way through the crowd
But she whispered
And if they did, they didn't care
Cameramen and newspapers had come.
To get your interviews
Because it will never be the same here
Although some people say it's crazy
At Dopefiend's Diner
Because another innocent dies
Free Libra Dogg Territory
Snoop Dogg, criminally minded
Fuck Kurupt dirty wit and your dead in every way
Pack your heat, if equipped say "hell yeah"
Wait these seconds and then watch what the microphone sounds like
It's a clear blue sky and a clear blue day
Provocative images of this lyrical abuse transgression
And unstoppable, Daz
Now what do you want to do? (What do you want to do?)
I get you to bustin, you duck (Blaow blaow)
Uncontainable, my mental state is so tense
I am a D.P.G.C. for life
I am a D.P.G.C. for life
I smoke indo and drink cognac
Face to face punk you can eat a dick
Because you're out of time, out of sight
With skills as a hunting expert, fucks and hurts
Look at me in black and be careful
If it were where you reside, what would you do?
Motherfuckers yeah
Do not doubt that Snoop
• 50 niggas
• Burning Jesus on the cross
• notorious
• Fuck the world
A nation under a bully and bullet scar
It appears and the motherfuckers bow, they recognize
Who wants to see me alone? Catch Makaveli while sleeping
Uh, bend over or kick yourself, drink until you pass out
I'm not afraid to die, drunk driving in my greenhouse
Niggas hates the beach, label them as my enemies: I'm going crazy
I knew that God had a plan for me
Maybe I'm windy or paranoid that a bitch
Who you are
A nation under a bully and bullet scar
Young nation just trying to get this
With the Pac holding the shot, progressive
They really don't want no drama, I know your thugs
Don't try to lie and say you were bustin '. I'm smart, stupid!
Who you are
A nation under a bully and bullet scar
A nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this
It was at this uncomfortable moment
that you and I became friends
and our bond was a memory
Worried, if you come in a hurry
I open fire, let the Lord choose the first to bleed
Tell them to bury a G in everything I love
I can't sleep because I keep hearing peeps
You prefer to fuck with these other little G's
These motherfuckers want to play, we can do it all day
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they don't see
Don't make enemies with me
Now we're in '94, niggas goin 'through the do'
And freeze these fake G's. You know how we do it.
Don't make enemies with me, nigga
I try to tell these motherfuckers they don't see
You don't see it
Young thugs fuck the drugs
Because you guys are gonna make the asshole rip you
They rip off patches, ass niggas
We're running, smile with a handshake
"Your life has been marked by considerable pain ...
No, but ... I ... go for it ... I try
And handle it!
We are in traffic
It's all right, uhh
Everything will be fine if you hold on
Let the AK bomb drop where the kids play
My friends die before they can see their birthdays
I'm dealing with insanity, raised by a single mother
You have to keep your head in the sky and be strong, especially hold on
Everything will be fine if you hold on
I know there are no tears falling on your face
And when these destroyers try to knock you out
You stand there to face them, tell them to hold on and be strong
Hold on and be strong, this is Black Man
It doesn't stop until the coffin falls
Imagine if we could go back
But we must have hope, quoting the reverend from the pulpit
This is not talking about problems, I bring solutions
You raped, now I'm back to haunt your nights
How do I declare myself?
Come on!!
Entering, speaking, "Where are the quaaludes?" What do you say silly
Armed with grenade pistol missiles
Tilted in these suckas, time to die
So I have no hope
Rolling down the Swervin highway, don't worry
Maybe if they tried to understand me
I had to feed my fucking family
Fuck hanging with them fake in the clubs
I have my mind in danger
I'm drinking Hennessey
Running from my enemies
Blood in my eyes
But what mattered most was an M&M package.
Be the fly on the wood grain, inside my chicken coop
Located and ready to turn on my slug
I'm not afraid to shoot these suckas if they test me
Trust, I have my beach armed with Glock if they press me
Better duck because I'm not looking when I'm - blaaastin '
Keep my brain in the game and keep my head strong
Constant beatings on the streets
And I'll be dancing loc
Bring it on, shoot that nigga {pistol shot} huh
Rich people in the house
Can you feel the motherfuckers going {shots} huh
Rated R in the damn house, watch out, watch out {gun shot}
K-Lo (watch out, watch out) in the damn house {pistol shot} huh
Two shots to the head, (is he a policeman?) Can you hear me? (kill him) {gun shot} huh
READ THE PAPERS (thug life nigga) (thug life), READ THE PAPERS! {Gun Shot}
But it doesn't kick any material from inside the heart
Fade away, fade away
I just don't get it and frankly I don't get it
So if you're looking for a fool, you can pass me
I'm styling presenters
Crashing and they love it and they hit me like Razor Ruddock
Hitting him with the raging styles, and I get paid to say
Mr. Sambo, stop and look for his similar appearance
But there are a million fakes, a million snakes selling a million tapes
Don't disrespect me, punk, I'm a citizen
We don't deal with trying to fade away
Never fade away (never, no!)
The one who writes for Billboard Charts
2 Live a life full of LOVE
R reunited in the afterlife
But he is not the one, because if he is, why did you leave?
Twenty-two or so, major soldier on my team
Baby can you fade me away
And I moved once I turned the page, I turned it, now it's on
I ran through cousins, through aunts to triplets
Because most conversations will kick you, you will surely understand
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
Watch how you stutter and shit nigga, be careful
Evading my niggas as a radio and then I try to play with me
Because my conversation getting hot enough for love doing
This thugs passion so your man can't get it back
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
And after a few glasses of this baby Thug Passion
Huh, it's going to be like Adam and Eve, do you feel me?
Everything stops, puff puff, and you don't stop
So tell me baby boo, can you fade us away
Hello a love to that black D'Angelo
Huh, we also have this bitch, so uhh
WEST SIDE!! THUG LIFE!! WEST SIDE!! THUG LIFE!!
Ladies and gentlemen! (And gentlemen)
An image of perfection, the object of a nigga affection.
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
You want me to lick it and even worse
You make me
And I give it back to you (I give it to you, I give it to you)
And if you want, then we can travel until the sun shines
Baby throw your legs out the window
Remember me? "I move" and my "temptations" chase me
Sexual participation, my motivation
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
A fair exchange, you know the game
Yes, it's true, I'm putting my pussy on, but baby, you're putting your cock on!
Because you act like you do something, give me a piece
And I give it back to you (I give it to you, I give it to you)
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Pushing, pulling and spinning I'm on a mission, I got into the mash
I tried to dig, you were screaming when I did
Do you want a "Freak Like Me", fuck Adina
Fair exchange
Fair exchange
No theft (everything is legal black)
And if you want, then we can travel until the sun shines
And just for fun, I bet I can make you cum 61 times
Because when we fuck I refuse to pop a walnut until I hit it
And let me hit it where it counts and run away
Bitch, you're not doing me favors, fair trade!
Fair exchange
No theft
Fair exchange
No theft
In the naked bed, you're so twisted, think your legs break
You said take it, so I'm blind to my passion, how long will it last?
(if I make you and you make me)
(if I make you and you make me)
Fair exchange, fair exchange
It is not a robbery, it is not a robbery
Nooooo, nooooooo ...
Fantasies of yours in submission, strange positions
I tried to dig, you were screaming when I did
As soon as I saw her she saw us playing hiding the weiner
The jog caught your eye when I passed by and said, "Hello."
First you put your heart into me, and that's not a fair exchange
Baby you can treat me well we can do it all night
You can get what you want, I got what I want and I left
And since you're tied up with penetration
It is correct to show a form of appreciation
Look, I wait until you fall asleep and that's revenge
A true digger that triggers love, a black thug
Baby you can treat me well we can do it all night
(The things that I will do for you)
Tell me about these fake bitches
I believe you all that just because she let a nigger throw her
Damn punks, I hate you snitches
The game is deep and thicker than a fucking jimmy
Lyin 'ass niggas and punk ass whores
Lyin 'ass niggas and punk ass whores
Lyin 'ass niggas and punk ass whores
Oh you black too don't think we're not talking about your punk ass
It'll be harder and harder to be a thug in the ninety-six '(I can't stand fake bitches)
Break them something
They love G a young black fool and getting riches
I think all of that just because she let a nigger throw her
And call me when you're ready to bone, and it's on
A motherfucker tonight
Stay stuck because my raps are tight
Damn punks, I hate you snitches
It's not about sheiiiiiiiit!
Break them from something
The game is deep and thicker than a fucking jimmy
I can't take it, hoes talking that they have a man
So how about hitting a motherfucker on my pager?
Fly like I'm fading, I played it like a Sega game
Lyin 'ass niggas and punk ass whores
I can't stand fake bitches
I can't stand fake bitches
Break them from something
I can't stand fake bitches
Lyin 'ass niggas and punk ass whores
I can't stand fake bitches
Break them from something
We learn a lot from the 60s how to dazzle 13 necks
Mainly niggas get shot for burning their larynx
Makes you want to grab a gun and drop all the black gear
But it's still a very powerful word
We need leaders, we are looking for artists
Blacks get paid and then run away from the community
That's not gangsta nigga, you're the opposite of Huey P
Disrespect and I give you a bar to save your life
Could you learn from the stars that fall from the sky
Stalk the stage with the pride of the panther
It's not gone, you hear its influence on pop songs
You would see Afeni Shakur about Larry King and the damn Dennis Miller
So we cry shooting stars, they still live so hard (We're still here)
Now of course this was inspired by 2Pac Shakur
We lost our Big Poppa and our girl
When else in the history of this country?
and flickering starlight
2 being loved by so many, so intimate
And my niggas say
Come on! Come on!
Who can I blame? The world seems strange sometimes
I'm living blinded, seeking curse of refinement
And worse still, with each breath, steps I take, out of breath.
Unconditionally married to my gun
Nothing but pain, caught in this game
Seeking fortune and fame
It was nothing but pain, caught up in this game
He was raised with a watch box
You can be an easy man, but you are a child in your heart
Something worth dying for
Seeking fortune and fame
Trapped in this game
And that stays the same until the day we kill
Nothing but pain
Seeking fortune and fame
It does not mean that we are not created equally
It is the true beauty in the tree
Or in the vast forest where you breathe?
I find greatness in the tree, which grows against all odds
The rose that grew from concrete, yes.
The tree that was not meant to be
It blooms in ... darkness, and gives birth to a promising pod
It does not mean that we are not created equally
It is the true beauty in the tree
Among the evils of weeds
I find greatness in the tree, which grows against all odds
You have been denied time to try
I finally did it, now focus
Brothers or sisters
They keep yelling '' bitches ''
Oh bad now, look what we have
Miss Billy Badass runs around, packing double gloves, uh
We might stumble, but I dare you to fuck tricks with Storm
It is strictly representative
Better adjust that addiction before you crush your place
Sistas get them to keep going
Now let me hear you scream
Let me see you raise your hands
Only for riders
For riders
Let me see you raise your hands
of different trees
does not mean
It is the true beauty in the tree
Thinking about your night thigh, so hold on tight
Visualizing the figure, damn it, that excites me
Feeling your heart beat, our arms are intertwined
Wanting to kiss you, the passion that passes
I close my eyes and visualize, it's you I feel
Is trying to make my fantasy come true
I just have to find this girl in my fantasy
It is the only opportunity to make my fantasy come true.
Damn I can't explain it the state I'm in
But she walks away, almost as fast as she got there.
I really didn't want to, so I accepted the facts
I sat on my patio, then realized I was well outside
Rolling down the avenue chilling
With incredible sound (from whom?) Marvin Gaye
"Look at this" is what he told me
But when she opened the door, I couldn't open my mouth
I mean, damn it, there she was, right in front of my face
Except my name is Ryan D. and it's a beautiful day
She looked me in the eye and broke it all
She had to catch me, had to have me somehow, somehow
Bodies tense and touched together when we begin to move
Her eyes were closed now that she felt so soft
But when I open my eyes, my alarm went off
"What happens?" said
I fell in love with a fantasy
Man, it was kind of a trip, man
I can never say this to a homey boy. Hey, keep this between you and me, man. No one will ever believe anything like this. Alright man, I'm going straight to the man at school
Quiet. Me what?
My niggas twisted even though it seems
From Crenshaw to 125, and Do or Die
One time I; start my show smash enemies
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we bloat life
It's the Don Daddy with the villain, whom you kill
Oh we hate them, literally come with this peeled cap
You handle shit carelessly, I drop a ki correctly
Pop a necklace, drop a dollar if you hear me you can holla
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we bloat life because you never know when you're going
This outlaw style took a brother off the streets
Have a nice trip because you should never have touched me
Life as an outlaw is not for everyone
So here we go
Recognize how we organize ourselves.
Create strategies now we unite brothers on the rise
I can earn a million and I STILL don't have enough spending
And since my life is based on sin, I'm tied to hell
I make a point, to make my beat hit the war
{Scratches}
Mr. X you know me to (Yes, come on!)
Turn it over as false identities, sticking it to my enemies (Enemies!)
The only reason I have enemies that used to be friends
What do you say? Speak punk, I can't hear you
Pray for my fall, speak like hoes
Like a monkey that's going to stop the show
The damn dust kicker, who can you trust?
My name is spoken in the tongues of so many enemies
They ask me how I am living? Jaa, I'm a scammer
But I won't live, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather shoot my target
They ran me out of the police, where to go
We have the smallest combination of this right here, man
Ha ha man, are you running out of steam yet?
Is that all you got, man?
Goes one, two, three to the room
To serve hot dishes in all Unified States
You better walk like a nigga on a tightrope
Pushing to the limit like Montana did
But I won't live, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather shoot my target, oh shit!
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
Better to have a vest pointed at the chest and then bury
Who can I trust? I have my mother stressed out, thinking it's a drug raid
We live a life of drugs, THUG LIFE, every day could be my last
Those are the consequences when you already live fast
With the lights off, rolling down a dirt road
But I won't live, I'd rather die than be a convict
The flash light buzzed me, it wasn't right like drugs
Torn like a machete, my alias Makaveli
Niggas ain't trying to see me paid, they'd rather take mine
Spending and bustin 'you thought about it, but you weren't ready
I kick them all day
And my motto, make Biggie Smalls pay
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you face to face
Exposing my enemies for being bitches
Let's move on
I am the first to bomb, first is calm and then panic.
The way my niggas strategize
All my life compromised, I write songs to spit
It's death row
You want to bet, I make the bitch come straight out of you
Don't let me tell you what some real niggas would do
I want it all, fuck the conversation uh
The Immortal Outlawz, you niggas are hoes but you already saw it, although Malc aka Amin coma E.D.I, the drama is needed
So you keep stealing, a hungry hunger targeting B.G.
You all niggas know how we do it
Tell me baby, what's your frequency?
You see I'm making proposals that are full of verbal indecency when you find me
The flash light buzzed me, it wasn't right like drugs
Niggas ain't trying to see me paid, they'd rather take mine
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size
Come and be my enemy killa, when I see you face to face
First to bombard, right outside the door, nigga, fuck next to you
On the ten o'clock news, your friend came then
Niggas yelling "oh no"
Showing evidence of nigga, we're cutting your neck, motherfucker
First to bombard, quick to download
Exposing, my enemies, for being bitches
It is full of ammunition
My army uniforms ready for battle
As soon as my niggas break, earthquakes all over the planet
Come and be my enemy killa, when I see you face to face
First to bombard, right outside the door, nigga, fuck next to you
And chases its own rhythm [?]
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck off
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
Come and be my enemy killa, when I see you face to face
Hitting all of you [?] Out of their heads, yeah
Sliding down my shit wondering what blows he gets
Even before the movies they always hit me for flipping the script
I drive the funk out of the trunks, pop the bomb in the socks
Dum diddy dump, love to hit
Leaving niggas with plumps, smoking blunt and skunks
Or let yourself be carried away by the worst of our triumphs for fun
Flex, flex flex
Direct service, what grass, kicked to the sidewalk
I bet you can't give in with the tough niggas
So why do you want to play a quiz?
Representative with
Ayo, spark, divide fifty niggas
Shit, they keep holes in nigga deals
Attacking niggas like the fucking list with quick punches
Strictly representing the cursed fugitive [?]
Those niggas can't be fucked with
Cause my niggas ain't afraid to flex, you feel me
If you don't forgive my heart today and I'll recover before forever
What if my doubts and? It bothers you, forgive my fragile heart
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Always young, I want to be always young
But I still have high speed memories when the police crashed
Many dreams is what I had, and many wishes
I have the press asking questions, trying to stress me out
My main man had two strikes, slipped, was arrested and overturned
Outlaw on the mash, trying to be the first to see some cash
Do you really want to live forever? Forever Young
My niggas cry, we all cry and we all ride
Until I die, they label me as ridah
Yeah you got the Live Squad on this motherfucker
Now they're chasing me, hanging around for a niggas money
Time to see, who's the G, with the biggest nuts
Some niggas need to feel me with passion
(Yeah Pac, fuck that, I still hit them with
And after she crossed out
Picking up pockets with a razor firing Russian rockets
I'm depressed at the sound of the Hard Squad, boom!
Coming straight from the dome where I wander, it's a job
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
MAC-11 blaster, and I run faster
Many bodies of shit will fall
You know what I'm saying? Squad indeed, YG'z indeed
So nigga flip or ride in a body bag
Yes, one more statistic, up front and broke
Fuck the police because my gauge catches me ... PAID
Hugging my AK, fuck playing, hey
First you had your mouth full of foreheads
Now your mouth is full of pieces, Pac is out of the blunt
Put the rhyme to the test I'm going to hit your hair an inch
who lost his son 2 a racist society
with Malcolm's blood in my veins
Yes
Don't stop (one more time, one more time)
West Coast
Now all my bitches and my niggas
Well it's that slow flow, D-O-double-G, black
Do or die (Me)
Wave your damn fingers in the air
Coming With A Gangsta Fucking Fist For Ninety-Three
And leave me and my Dogg Kurupt to fuck
Shake your damn hands in the air
Come on
Nothing but pain, caught in this game
I know, death follows me, but first I will kill him.
Nothing but pain, caught in this game
Ha, ha, yes
I love that ghetto shit (that ghetto shit)
For fame (fame) Notoriety
Have everyone looking at me
I'm making up all the time, I floss to lose it (floss to lose)
Stay the same, from the day I came (fame), it will never change
Without gloves
Filled with blunt commons unconditionally married to my gun
Seeking fortune and fame
Some niggas go back, some niggas fall down and hide
Then disrespecting O.G. companions
I have to ride with two twin Glocks, I have to sleep with my fingers on the triggers
2Pac, go crazy!
I wanna be, let me fuck that nigga
Let's be friends where my niggas are
Come closer to you and post a minute, yeah
As you spend goodbye winking
Through that scandalous shit
Acting like your shit, you don't suck
Look at my resume, sipping Cristal and Alizé, vomiting
Imagine countless options, was it prophecy?
Clear as day, visions of me
Scream my name because baby it's delicious
I have a weak point for pretty bitches
You'd probably hate to see a real bully with vision
Because you have changed
Come on put your cash let's pay
I don't wanna be your man, bitch
That's crazy
You let me fuck that nigga
What is that?
(Turn it off, turn it on)
(Where my niggas at)
(Go Go)
The coin seems small, I need company
You have to be in the front, let's be friends
I met you and I stuttered with passion
Every time you pass you have me checking for you
Hardcore, watching and watching
Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions of me
Instead of seeing a black man in jail, why are you changing?
Baby long strokes
(Where are my bitches? Show me where my bitches are)
(Bully style)
Westside in this motherfucker
Be friends, tell me where my niggas are
Make money, take money
And hey, I started dumb, it came from a hooded rat
But nothing changed, I was caught in the game
Niggas in masks that will explode in the task force
We break bread, now we kill brothers
A war in which they are not prepared
Hurry like a crack demon until I'm caught
Hey, from the bible I read
See, the meek will inherit the Earth
Now what are you gonna do, when my niggas come for you
Tell me now what are you gonna do when my niggas
But it's the black timin '
Now what you don't know is that I have a 16 point scream
Where's your buster ass crew?
When my niggas come for you
you and I have perfect hearts destined for a day 2 I know
Ha ha ha ... hey man fuck everyone ... fuck everyone
I have problems, no one is calling
You can throw your middle finger if you feel me, loc
And when you stayed, where the hell are all your friends?
Fuck all of you
"Thug For Life" spread across the wall
And everything about my dollars makes me wanna holla
Drop an album, sell a million, give it shit for tomorrow
"I thought I had friends, but I don't have fucking friends
I thought I had friends, but I don't have screwed friends
Fuck all of you
Quick to socialize with the baddest bitches
I'm seeing death around the corner
I'm running into "Gloriaaaa", doing 90 ‘because I want
I thought I had friends, but I don't have screwed friends
I thought I had friends, but I don't have screwed friends
I thought I had friends, but I don't have screwed friends
Fuck all of you
That's right i don't need anybody
Fuck the bitches, the TV news, the New York Post, all those motherfuckers
Now i can make it happen
I went from rocks to zines, writing raps and movies
Now, could you imagine my criminal status at its peak?
Even the baddest will be killed in their seats
World mafia figure addicted to these fucking streets
Blacks are not murderers, so they hid (Why?)
Living my life in the fast lane, fucking through the past
I have my mind on my cash
Come raise your hands in the air!
Back off, I hit all of you guys
You can bet your last dollar, I'm gonna dick 'em and holla
Choose my Glock for my benefit
Riders outlaws, hit the gas
Now I wanna do it too, ooh, ooh
Can you imagine me hitting niggas because they watch and chain?
I have a brother, don't rest and he has some drugs
I keep my mind on my money and my money on my mind
With my back against the wall, like I'm running out of time
Screaming, "Thug Life, bitch, fuck off!" and die for them
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
Back off, I hit all of you guys
Nigga, we horsemen outlaws
Don't mind if you love us, we're killing
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
Where the hell do these niggas live where all this shit is going down?
Covert tactics, leave my enemies dead
Bust it, I disarmed your whole crew, heartless, I'm not worried
Tell everyone to let the games begin, we have war games
I was shot 5 times, I got out of jail on bail
(Background while chorus:
He sold more records and then everything you cheated on Muthafuckaz.
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
I'll let niggas know he's stuck for life
Stupid damn idiot! (drunk ho)
The coin seems small, I need company
So why do you hesitate, act like your shit doesn't stink?
Cream dreamin ', motherfucker, in a puree for bitches
It broke and I smoke every day. Baby, let's be friends!
You don't have to be my man at all
As long as you bring me your friends (Cash makin 'hoes)
Although a little blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Me and you, one by one, we imagine countless options
Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions of me
Far from falling in love, I want to break your guts and touch
Back to you, my pretty candy queen
I have my hands on your thighs, now leave me in the middle as friends
I prepared her for a booty call, I caught your bitch
You got me stoned, let me in!
A bad seed became good in this world of G
Baby got me fantasizing about seeing you naked
(Throw your weapons in the air!)
Friends ... (My ghetto love song!
Let's be friends (Where are my niggas? Where are my bitches?)
Where are my people? Show me where my people are!
Let's be friends, tell me where my people are
Let's be friends (Get cash! Let's get dough!)
(Come on, put your cash!)
Why are you fooling other hoes?
Let's be friends (Come on, put your money in cash! Let's pay!)
You don't have to be my man at all
Earn money, take money!
Still elusive, but exclusive is what I give you when I kick it
You can bring that bitch in, but all your clicking will still be treated like shit
Nigga, if you were half the man your bitch was
My phone is tapped, so I had to send a message through my little friends.
Shit, this is what you get, for fucking the wrong nigga
Fallin 'legends clutchin' chrome three-five-seven
I learned my math skills from real drug dealers
No need for an ambulance, baby, bring the black hearse
I never should have fucked up, buster
It is what it seems, ding ding ding ..
Fuck the police
And the punk police can't fade me
But right now
And my sprouts on the block better get tied
Case you can't see
Until then, GET UP
But be grateful that you're blessing
Stop until I die
Thug for life
Twisted Police Shootin
Letting it fly
One way or another, you will deliver it - hugh
Twisted Police Shootin
Letting it fly
Interview [referring to playing a police officer as an actor]:
I told the judge that I am in danger
Fuck the world!
They try to say I don't care
I woke up screaming "Fuck the world!"
They're trying to say that I don't care
Have I lost control or just another soul?
Drinking gnac while I sit, life like a big mack
The brothers come up and say "did you do that?
Damn, they want to label me as a threat
Nigga, fuck the world!
I've been through hell and back and if I fail, nigga
Some of you niggas are busts, they run around
With these stray bitches don't trust her
But don't cry, this world is not ready for us
Fuck the world!
I woke up screaming "To hell with the world!"
Uhh, uhh, uhh .. Fuck the world!
We are not dead yet
From hustlin 'and bustin' they rhyme
Niggas ass bitch don't know my style
I'm still rolling my bucket but I bought a Benz
Just me inside the cell, locked in this hell
Choose a reason to hide from all the niggas that die
Act like you know when I crawl too slow
Blacks don't know my style
Niggas ass bitch don't know my style
(Who's that?) A real beach called Eazy
But I don't think so, coming if you're crazy
(Hook): 2pac
Niggas ass bitch don't know my style
Quick to smile, youthful, he was a troubled kid
(2Pac collision)
I'm caught up in this disease
I wonder if they'll catch me
Should I shoot your bitch?
I don't want to commit murder
Because life is a wheel of fortune
I don't have time for police
Who stumbles and tries to catch me
Too fucking happy trigger
Trying to find my hiding place
Take out all nine
Now i'm going to dive and pump your butt
First fight with these mice
Deee tray went crazy
I guess the little mice
And fuck it five-oh, blaow blaow
Dear Mama
Your baby would be dead at 16
They tell me that the preacher is there for me.
And how can these people judge me?
I never had to be a man
And my friends bury the motherfuckers (Please!)
Stay away from these Aryan motherfuckers
Because once they locked you up
These cops don't understand me
I became a life of crime
I kept it deep
Brother in my cell
When you're black
And you're trapped
In a living hell
You shouldn't let it catch me
Get old and cold
My mom prayed for me
I take the breath of your jugular
until you arrived
Give me some of that liquor
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink
Time to have my drink baby!
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink
Time to have my drink, yes!
It's time to have my drink
Go Go
I see no changes, I wake up in the morning and wonder
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Time to fight back, that's what Huey said
I have love for my brother but we can never go anywhere
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
Things will never be the same
Aww yeah
But some things will never change
It is the war on the streets and the war in the Middle East.
Instead of the war on poverty, they had a war on drugs
Break you and pimp hit you
And I can never lie down
Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way uhh
Those who want to follow me
If I could remember before my bell days
I stop and look at the youngest
When you wipe your eyes, look at it clearly
If you take your time to listen to me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me up
Guess who is giving birth to a baby?
Even now I get discouraged
I wonder if they get it all back, will I still have the courage?
I feel your hand on my brain
Without the sound of guns
Https://genius.com/18627661
My heart goes to them
And today things changed
I hope we see the light before it goes bankrupt
Because that's the life when you live in it
Ghetto
From the frying pan we jump into another form of slavery
I say the ghost take over drink my own bottles
I make mistakes but I learn from everyone
(Chorus, Akon)
Ghetto
Ghetto
Ghetto
Because any day they will press the button
It is not black or white because we are human
I make mistakes but I learn from everyone
I feel his hand on my brain when I write rhymes, I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
They try to find out what a brother thinks when he is cursing
9 out of 10 will find the problems, it's time to listen and see what you can do to solve them
So think about it ... why did 2Pac hit cha, hit cha with some ghetto gospel?
I used to roll around on my back and use a lot of drugs
Lord can you hear me speak
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Makaveli
As I remain within a paradox called my block
I hit the grass and I hope God can fly high
Just sell me your soul and live the life (of a ghetto star)
Tied up with the game, practice takin 'pain
Smart, competent, smart street
And keep the shoots pounding until the snitches start to smell it
CROWD. Related, a mo 'nigga found shot with his dick in his mouth
I raised my head, from my hands, I had a palm of tears
Your family, shit! There is nothing left to identify
Why did I hear that the feds had an arrest warrant?
Rate me as a success, I made the change
A wife addict, my life, as a ghetto star
Hitting the curve, letting it drift, had to stop them from holding on
No regret, no regret as I take down one
Straight to the morgue cause I plan to shut the shit up
Torn ligaments all on that black shoulder
And a vest couldn't protect that meat
I guess they heard I got them birds
Luxurious luxury, with dreams of dying rich
And get down to business with these snitch bitches, protecting wealth
Live my life like a ghetto star
(Spank bitches is not new)
Even if I die, I will be a damn problem
Mom tried to raise me, but she had too many babies.
Dad was a motherfucker, kidding
Daaamn, don't make me start
Don't cry, just ask why and try not to die
As I take you through the lullaby of a ghetto nigga
In the corner where the niggas crack
And hidden funds lift those who don't look at them
(Five-0) dream of the drug world
Snatching drugs, pumping slugs on these other thugs
Don't cry, just ask why and try not to die
A seven deuce full of niggas goes by
He recognized the dishes, the faces looked familiar
Everyone swears they know the nigga who's going to kill you
A Mac-10 out the window to drop it, what could I do?
And then we'll be ghosts
As I take you through the lullaby of a ghetto nigga
FUCK THE NIGGA POLICE!
bend
Just rolling (What's up Snoop?)
Two in the morning and the party keeps jumping
I got bitches in the living room putting on
And they won't be gone until six in the morning
Shit, I have a pocket full of rubber and my friends too
Relaxed, with my mind on my money
Now this kind of shit happens all the time
Get up off these N-U-T's, because you don't get any of these
Just rolling!
Relaxed, with my mind on my money
Just rolling!
Just rolling!
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm screwed now
Don't be mad, girl, this is how it goes
Just rolling!
Just rolling!
Let me hear you say "Death Row"
(Death row)
Say "death row"
(Dogg's Pound)
Say "Snoop Dogg"
I fucked his bitch and sold five million
This is how we do it, you know that the beaches are on the west side
Fat motherfucker Biggie entered the game, trying to cross a black
He has nothing to say
Snoop running for president, he represents the gangsta here
Cardboard, man, I'm just trying to be a friend, but
Give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC
I ask for cardboard for a damn account, but the black said "no"
Give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC
Give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC
Give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC
When I was alone and had nothing
No one could help me ... except God
So when they ask me ... who do I give my unconditional love to?
Rest in peace with my motherfucker Biggy Smallz
The other day I thought I had seen my friend Biggy
Saying shit don't stop, nigga don't have mercy
Motherfuckers who make money plot outrageous schemes
God bless death
God bless death
Man, nobody promised me anything
I got caught up in this game
I can see them in my head - Pow!
And if I die, will they shed tears?
Paranoia made me look in the mirror
See I'm old enough to know there's no justice
God bless death
God bless death
God bless death
All the young motherfuckers who were taken in prepare
I Stretch, Biggy
Why did you have to take my nigger with the rock-a-bye?
You had to have a good one, a son from the ghetto hood, Uzi weighed a ton
God bless death
Who thinks they have me
I'm on superman shit now
They shouldn't have shot me
And God has blessed me with the power to be tough 2 kill
Fuck everyone
Lit on the roof of my man
Moon motherfuckaz 'til they feel me
Verse 02 Rakim:
Tonight if the Rs on the microphone
There is a small possibility
Radiant energy, that will be worth it
Touch the third lane under the pain of the remedy
Now it's a habit
Beware of overdose
You will rest in peace with them
It was the rhythm
you leave my side until the moment you come back
Only 4 the feeling of joy that you bring me
(Ray Tyson)
I had the toughest team in the bells, so I just had to win
I tried to say that we cheated, because they beat him
Kick it, it's just a day in the life
I tried to get out of my bed, but I can't move
You see I'm glued to my mattress like crazy glue
I got up to brush my teeth because my breath started to stink
So I wonder who it is? and the answer surprises me
He and Dizzy had been waiting for me
I started rapping, the girls started clapping
Girls in my tip but I really don't sweat them
We listen to the introduction, the audience is loud
But there are a crowd of people in the limo
Roc is signing dizzy makin 'girlies autographs
Crowd sweating strictly because we are busy
Fools want to fight us, we move in silence
And the more I try to sit, the less it seems I get up
Just another way to live a day in life, kick it
A girl starts to hide and I scare her!
Rap is my fort and my recreation
Girls want to kiss me, fools want to dissuade me
The ladies want, the masters of ceremonies admire
It is not difficult to understand, it is only one day in life.
I remember when you were lost
But then your soul was found
But with this you forgot about me
I pray to God to stay
This is the most real shit I've ever written
21 pistol salute, dressed in uniform, black jeans and boots
We shook Dre punk's ass, now he came out of the closet
I love how I drove you crazy nigga
Against all odds I hope my real motherfuckers know
Listen as I take you back and tie this rap
I heard the arms bust but your tricks never shut me up
Play one of mine, in everything I love
I'll destroy everything you touch
Last words to a black bitch: "Why are you lying?"
He did something he shouldn't have done, so we're going for it
Ayo, Nas, all your damn style is bitten
Read about my life in the newspapers
All my encounters with authorities, criminal capers
To the truest shit I ever spoke
Representing the maximum, being soldiers with military minds
I only remember what you told me
They say
Photos of me in my final stage, you know that mom cried
Look at me and I hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
So bring your big butt to California, cause it's not hard to find
Watch them pause as I remove the strap from my drawings
Movin 'Dodge van, fifty rounds in the clip
Some may call me loot, but I call it timin '
Because a constant black hatching
Playboy, what the hell is a test without the trauma plate?
Nigga, what the fuck do you have a gun for if you're going to hesitate?
But now, my Glock is so critical
Rear seat of a rental
If your gum bleeds and you need
Heavy in the game
To the left, to the right
I respect you lady
Because you gave me all your pussy
Leave your number on the cabinet
Cause I've never met a girl
So how the hell am I supposed
Cause she's just a bitch to me
Why don't they pay attention?
It's not fun if friends can't have any
It's not fun if friends can't have any
(I can't hear you, sing it)
With a fat cock for your damn mouth
Because when the bitches get rowdy and throw a voodoo
So I advise you not to trust that hoe
But look, it's not fun
Because you know I don't love it
I do not love it
I never did, boo-boo
Something for my niggas to travel
Something to get your money
It has to be strong, no matter what they do, they can't break us
Because in my hood they
Let the AK bomb drop where the kids play
These are the worst days
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth.
I know it's not the truth
Does it matter if you're from blood or because
Remember how it was
And although I had
Dear Lord, can you hear me?
Can we pretend that planes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
All I could see was my mom's eyes
My friends and I have no choice but to move on
And even though we are G
And in my mind I see this place, the players come in fast
Can we pretend that planes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone
Suppose things had not been different
There's no point in playing the game
There's no way you can win. "
He had a father and his mother was not as crazy as shit.
Fuck a talent show in the gym, bitch
‘Because he never risked shit, he hoped and wanted it
Planes in the night sky are like shooting stars ...
I wish now, I wish now
I could really use a wish right now
Wait for me black as you wait for Jesus to return
Wait for me black! I'm going'!
Oh yeah! Ha, ha, yes)
It's about you, once (I say it's about you, baby, yeah)
You probably twisted like the last trick
It's just my luck, I'm caught with the wrong fucking
Wise decisions, based on lies we live
Scandalous times, this game is like my religion
Well darling if you got it better brag
Let the liquor help you up
I guess what they tell me is true
Every other city we go to, any other video
I love black people because we come from the same place
Waiting niggas at the end of every show
I just saw you in my friend's video
Yeah nigga it's all about you
It's all about you
Every other city we go to and every video
I get depressed like Dru, and my new nasty niggas too
You couldn't stop me, I'd take a fatter track
Directly in control, flows will double, while hoes take a cold ride
Hold on the set, I said to Dramacy 'come in later
(It's all about you)
Every other city we go to, any other video
Where are my ladies? Where are my ladies
Light that shit, man!
Everyone!
You probably twisted like the last trick
Wise decisions, based on lies we live
Well darling if you got it better brag
Fresh out of jail, life is hell for a black celebrity
Every other city we go to, any other video
I'll make you scream my name before I go
I only dated criminals and drug dealers
Crawl low, the grass smoke is in the air
Wherever you go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Follow the leader and watch the drama I'm going through
It's all about you
Yeah nigga it's all about you
Every other city we go to, any other video
Are you sick with your cock or is it the flu?
Do you think it's all about you? Well boo
I get depressed like Dru, and my new nasty niggas too
Gold digger, cold digging a gold Rolex
Just when I thought I had seen it all
and I knew from the first glance
your eyes attracted me first
and kiss me with the intentions of my heart
and the first blind date First impressions
and this was CUPID's blessing
(It's about you, once)
Thinking I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm caught with the wrong fucking
In every club, I see you like you want
Well darling if you got it better brag
I try holla, but you tell me what you took
But still what I say is true, boo, because this is about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
I promise that if you go with me, just let me know
I'll make you scream my name before I go
Witness me holla on a hoochie, look how fast the game takes
Crawl low, the grass smoke is in the air
Wherever you go, it's all about the groupie hoes
(This is not just for the ladies)
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
It's all about you
Oh yeah! Ha, ha, yes!)
Haha, for the bitches who think it's all about you
You probably twisted like the last trick
Wise decisions, based on lies we live
Well darling if you got it better brag
Hitting these walls as I stop, addicted to the fast life
Addicted to the things you do
Yeah nigga
How can I tell him that I am a beach? And I don't even care
No matter where I go, I see the same
It's all about you
Drinking liquor, kissing you to help you get to know me faster
Every other city we go to, any other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ...
Fucking OG
I bet you twisted it, you don't know who to trust
Let's say they're ready for funk, but I don't think they know
Straight to the depths of hell is where the cowards go
I got a caravan of niggas every time we travel
Fuck me and then I cross, the future in my eyes
The game sharper than a fucking razor blade
They can hold me for a second, but these punks won't catch me
Hello, my nigga 'Pac
The world changes every day, time moves fast
Let my bucket drift, I'm pulling off the sidewalk
It's not funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
The feds are watching, niggas plotting to catch me
I told the judge that I was raised badly and that's why I burn shit
(Live my life as a beach boss, because I'm even getting high)
I have busts, hoes and policemen looking at a nigger, you know?
(Live my life as a beach boss, because I'm even getting high)
I know you know this is Thug Life, baby!
Oh, you know what?
Straight to the depths of hell is where these cowards go
And may these demons repent for the day they finally set me free
Cause all I want is cash and thangs
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a black thug until the day of my death
My girl said she needed a raise, how long will it last?
I'm caught between my wife and my gun and my chips
Dedicated to serving this Moët and paying checks
Where are you going, I've been there, I came back alone, friend
What I can do? What can I say? There's another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
Live the life of a boss player because you're even getting high
Live the life of a boss player because you're even getting high
All eyes on me
Catching cases at a fast pace, playing in the fast lane
Live the life of a black thug until the day of my death
(Live my life like a black thug until the day of my death)
Do it, do it, do it!
Just another soul lost, trapped, calling Jehovah
A general at war, I'm the first to bomb
I am similar to Saddam, sometimes I wonder who is sane
Like frenzied demons for that last streak, caught in the game
I'm in Jamaica drinking daquiris, no doubt
I can't tour, afraid to pick up cases, litigation
We claim mafia, M.O.B. if you are specific
Come on everyone, pump first until they fall
I was riding with 'Pac, but when he died they went pop
I ride or die, but these other fag niggas are biting this
It is all from my heart when I was writing this; completely!
Come on everyone, pump first until they fall
Every nigga handles yours, wear it strong
Obstacles on your way, you better do your best
Talk or get treated like you're coming to kill us
Frontline soldier, until the heavens call me
Holla back, back and look at your mouth
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Tryna go the next day, nigga, see everything
Now it's 1999, it's a different routine
Does this love deserve 2 without a title?
because I chose 2 to let it grow
People tend to drown 2
what they don't understand
Take adversities
The next heavyweight champion in the world.
I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
Each boxer with a pair of gloves.
Here's a man making a bully
A lethally sharp weapon
And in my heart there is a desire
Now once high school drops out
I won't deny it
So why, fools, do you keep me?
Also, you will be boxing for us, friend
Constantly money on bitches
Stay in your routine, nigga
My ambitions as ridah
Uh, and my ambitions as ridah
I'm smoking butt weed, feeling crucial
I don't have time for these bitches' cause these hoes try to play us
I can't trust a bitch in the business so I got Death Row
But they can't do anything to a G
I'm ready to die here tonight and fuck your life
That's what they scream as they pierce me, but I'm hard to kill
(Is that all you got niggas?)
I got the police biting me
Pay the block, evade the cops because I know they will come for me
Question my methods for changing speeds
At that moment I contemplate the way that God did it
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I've been getting a lot of mail in jail, niggas tell me to kill him
Witness the most real thing, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
But they can't do anything to a G
I got the police biting me
You don't want to fuck me
Oh, that nigger's body. I just want to snatch her clothes and just make her
I got the police biting me
But they can't do anything to a G
This life as a rap star is nothing without a guard
Although life is complicated, only what you make it be
To catch her while it's hot and hot, climb inside her
I don't have time for these bitches' cause these hoes try to play us
But niggas thugs be on point and game tight (yeah)
These niggas are jealous
You don't want to fuck me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
I got the police biting me
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
But they can't do anything to a G
and I knew from the first glance
your eyes attracted me first
but you reeked of sensual confidence
and 4 at that moment we erase the tension
You don't want to fuck me
You don't want to fuck me
But they can't do anything to a G
I got the police biting me
To be a soldier, you must keep your composure at ease
No guts, no glory, my nigga, the bitch has the game distorted
Now it's on and on because I said so
Because deep in their hearts they want to be me
I catch you paying attention to my ambitions like a ridah
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
(I will not deny it, I am a true ridah)
(I will not deny it, I am a true ridah)
My attitude was "fuck it", because motherfuckers love it
From hasty prayers to breaking motherfuckers to pay us
The competition tore me apart for that shit they stress (Booyah)
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
I'm ready to die here tonight and fuck your life
Then open fire, shout 'kill me', witness my steel
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as ridah
Throw me but they didn't finish, they didn't diminish my powers
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
Witness the most real thing, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The scream of all your people when they find you
I got the police biting me
I got the police biting me
This life as a rap star is nothing without a guard
Although life is complicated, only what you make it be
Equipped with money in a Benz because, bitch, I'm hardly bankrupt
Uh yeah, and now you have me right next to you, waiting for you to hear
You don't want to fuck me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
I got the police biting me
That's what they scream as they pierce me, but I'm hard to kill
Spitting on adversaries, envious and after me.
Thuggin 'for life, and if you're right then nigga die for it
Pay the block, evade the cops because I know they will come for me
Niggas will feel the fire from my mother's corrupt seed
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I got the police biting me
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
Show me a miracle, I have no hope
And remembering the niggas who murdered my friend
Put a surprise in the mailbox, I hope you understand
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn't have
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Everybody dies. I'm next, who can I trust?
Or will they kill me while I sleep, two in the head?
I'm under pressure getting drunk, someone help me
I see my enemies crawling, don't make me explode
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
They want to bury me, I'm worried, there's no need to lie
I'm bustin 'on these motherfuckers in my madness
Well hell can't be worse than this, cause now I'm in hell
I see my enemies crawling, don't make me explode
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Or do you want to live forever?
I'm not fear to die
But tomorrow, I see a change (heh)
Children raised with nonsense, because nobody cares
But tomorrow I see a change
Morning...
And tomorrow
Fear of being marginalized
Tonight I lay my head down
Built on spirit, attempt of heart
And strong for pride
This is all about love!
Cho!
I have nothing if I don't have you
Remember I still love you!
I pray the day you say you love me too
ME!
But to have you, I will do EVERYTHING that is necessary (anything)
Give me a show chance, and I'll show you
This is not a flo '(flo')
Can we stick to the red cross?
Prepare to die or say you love me too
It's not 2Pac or that black Dr. Dre
That's why it's so hard to find me
Choo-choo, bustas, it's a must, let me burst, let me burst
Still niggas don't listen to me, baby
It's Warren G endo, I'm a little crazy
Rich could care about a hobo and a hoochie
I hang with niggas from the block like 2Pac
What you want to do is try to keep it locked up
Because it's about making money
We went and got some Tanqueray, nigga, we're not punks
What we do, we take money to the bank
Because all this is in the newspaper
Only blacks like to talk a lot, that's what we see
But fix it all, because I'll be ready to throw them up
Because a mack has to do what a mack has to do
But when you do, you won't be with me
So fuck a damn bitch
Your heart stops working and your soul is not happy at all
The river ... will flow forever, as long as you are with me
Out of there
(It's nothing more than a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention is to enrich myself
I have a well called Petey, she Nigerina
And let yourself be carried away by the little friend of the Regal
And i can make you famous
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
Defeat is not my destiny, set me free on the streets
Jealousy is misery, suffering is greed
Better get ready when you cowards fuck me
I burst and run, these niggas must be crazy, what?
No goddamn motherfuckers can't fade thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now it disappears
It's like Cuzz, Blood, gang-bangin '
You do your job every day
Let me tell you about life and the way it is
There are no answers to the questions, I'm trying to get up
(Nothing but a gangsta party
Realism difficult to understand, we are inclined
Enemies stand by my side, flows deepen like Poseidon
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshining your fake smiles, plastic tears
Killing busters is my damn job, him or me
From this cell to that cell, (While the world turns)
I'm not in front of me, I see my fucking soul, right in front of me
For these weak motherfuckers, my stray fools (weak ass tricks)
I have a lot of G on the way now, Marcy and I pay
My niggas explode, pay me now
Accuracy in my favors, unanimous decision
Fuck a dead religion colliding with prison walls
A street mercenary lieutenant wrote it
It's drastic, niggas will prepare you for the coffin
That real shit!)
For this dirty money earned as this twisted world spins
Which of you all niggas out there pulling money?
All these niggas tryin 'to get your advice but they swallow us ALL
I guess your soul nigga lost CONTROL, are you bad and BOLD?
You die now (Riders outlaw)
Tha Outlawz, Ghetto Stars, Makaveli The Don, YES
Death row gave birth to a new seed, Makaveli Records
Feel me now, yes (especially with Mobb Deep)
I will be there to bless you
But you can't, you can't give up
Now here is a story about a woman with dreams
So a perfect picture at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
I tried to change places in the tragedy.
Lord come and take me
Because they win when your soul dies
Baby don't cry I hope you raised your head
You don't have the guts to be what you want to be
You need people like me ..
There is nothing that separates us more than MAC - 10
Born in the ghetto as a swindler, senior
Let the cops turn on their lights, chase me, n * gga
Compete with me, n * gga in a high speed chase with the law
Everyone must die ...
I'm starting to lose hope, it seems like everyone's high
Mom told me to go, because I was broke
Alone, alone, I'm a criminal
I have nothing to lose and something to prove, what do I do?
Everyone must die ...
(All of you a lot of shit * sholes)
Say goodbye to BAD
Everyone must die ...
Say goodbye to BAD
Pray to my God every day, but he doesn't listen
I'm thirteen, I can't feed
I wish I had hugged him too much like him
Where did I go to? I'm hanging in the back streets
Running with G's and drug friends, will they rob me?
Everyone must die ...
Say goodbye to BAD
(You need people like me ..)
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
The plan, to take command of the whole family.
To be the boss, just the thoughts: grab the 9 from Chrome
Niggas are thrown, scars of war, memories of the battlefield
A gun grabbing nigga, unleash the Sandman
Blast, tell me, friend, what do you see now?
And yet, get my money, connect with Kastro
Close your eyes and listen to the ballad of a dead soldier
When my Glocks sounded, the blacks came out, BOOM!
Who wants to see me in a challenge?
Shedding tattooed tears, another suicide on the level
All the feds know us
Billionaire, shit, it's not fair
I am a well-known plastic case, call me [?]
Prolly gets your cash to go up at a faster rate
They want to explode while I last in this tragic place
And make the pain ruthless and tragic
Looking for these better days
You got me thinking of better days
No one looks at them, searching the wicked
A born bully first, the worst ways
And only we can change
Hey better days
Better days, better days, better days
That in my future years I would be stressed?
Also my P.O. won't let me hang out with the brothers I grew up with
Saving for some Jordan, because they dop
I have a girl and I love her, but she broke too
Tell me you're pregnant and i'm amazed
Better days
Hardly separated or separated, we were left vanished
Up in the gym, mess with me, I gotta mess with him
I have a place in my heart, friend, stay ready
I settled in, had a family, worked in a night school
Better days, better days
Better days, better days, better days
Better days are coming, boy, keep your head up!
Looking for these better days
I guess we were wicked since we were born, a product of cursed semens
A born bully first, the worst ways
And only we can change
And pray for better days
Better day, better days
You got me thinking of better days
Cowboys and Indians when your belly runs
When all we sprayed were water pistols
When your next door neighbor was your best friend
Searching for the real to leave the past behind
And the neighborhood watch goes to the police
Saying you set up a store
Who will keep us down, in this fucked-up scoop?
Whoever said it so well, must be a silly muthafuckin
It will leave many muthafuckaz stunned
Let's show a little love the right way
Now, after so many years, nothing has changed
That's why we hang, where we knock
So you do what you have to do to stay alive
I pray to the Lord to bring better days
Anonymous photos of other niggas trying to kiss her
My niggas and I are thug niggas, former known drug dealers
I have to blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my stack of papers
Baby there you go, acting like a ho
Baby there you go, acting like a ho
HOE! Girl you need to control yourself
I have hoes that have more, hoes than me
So how do I look hooked like I don't have a G?
Really cute big booty, but that's not enough
I woke up one morning with a big ass dick
Seen my little homey style that I haven't seen in a long time
Yes and i feel good
Jumping like a motherfucker trying to find a hoe
I go to the liquor store to drink a little
Pushing caviar and a little pussy
This cold, how do we fade away from our enemies?
Because they put me on the run
So I get smart and I get defensive and that shit
Bitches get ready to shoot down, shit is about to fall
You may be immersed in this game, but you are missing the rules
I have a well called Petey, she Nigerina
And I think I have a black Bimmer
It's nothing more than a gangsta party, party
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
Defeat is not my destiny, set me free on the streets
Better get ready when you cowards fuck me
No goddamn motherfuckers can't fade thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now it disappears
And then you work so hard until your hair turns gray
They wonder how I live with five shots.
Gangsters now run this motherfucker? (Hell yeah)
West Side is fucking here
Give up the blues house
Go West Side Outlaw
West Side!
Outlaw, microphone check
You don't know, it looks like you're a seed
From Makaveli The Don ...
Oh bitch niggas ...
I don't know if you catch up, but still
Thug life, Outlaw forever nigga
The class is in session: the worst question is the first.
The fat track made you jump, now are you hanging?
So I'm only going with what I know, I don't trust any
What is the reward for a fighter?
If the law loves us, why do they hate to see us come?
No one does not care (It seems my dreams
Drowned out by the screaming, there is no answer to my questions)
Nobody cares
"I couldn't help noticing that you're in pain"
A symbol for fighting without reward
(It will catch you, it will catch you)
The class is in session, the worst question is the first question
Not to be false and positive, but why be negative?
Dum dum answered me?
If it's not peace, at least let's get a piece
We used to have troops, but now there are no more, youth to shoot
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
My mom told me they would spend the day like this, but I'm angry.
Me mouse man
(They claim that I am violent)
Stay on point, make sure you're back.
A double M is kept, ready for the cock
My mom told me they would spend the day like this, but I'm angry.
Straight angry
(Will catch you)
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
(Will catch you)
(Will catch you)
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
In the eyes of God
(Will catch you)
(Will catch you)
(They claim that I am violent)
(Will catch you)
(You can be a Christian)
(Islamic) Definitely (I don't care, I'm a bully)
Caught up in a nightmare, hoping he cares
Made me pay to hide more green boys
My cell block, whatever it was, contained rock but never
Big sigh, why die wishing, waiting for possibilities
Submissive souls become hoes when exposed to prison
Someday, somehow
Somehow we will fail
Or six ditches or twelve
Just hit us and leave us in jail
When the result doesn't do me justice in the long run
And Black Jesus come and save our seeds because we need you
Do you think you could stop a motherfucker like me?
The more I unite with mo 'niggas and mo' niggas and mo 'niggas
I owe it to him, thanks to my man Mike Cooley and the rest of our parents.
* Poems written by Shakur as ~ performed by other artists
Possess a spirit that was strong.
It will be your strength that keeps us both standing
That makes us both stand
Black woman, you are pure, love me
and I knew from that point
I want smiles 2 replace sadness
but please fight that with everything
It will be your strength that keeps us both standing
For my life and your life
As long as we are cooperating with God
Remember what my parents told me
My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs, and murderers.
Now rule two is difficult: watch out for counterfeits
No doubt reaching higher than a motherfucker, bless me please
Come on yeah
(blas-blas-blasphemy, blasphemy)
Also, the media will severely crucify the brothers
Tell me that I am not the son of God; black mom a virgin
They evicted us, we had to leave the burbs
Criminal mind all the time, wait for the day of judgment
I broke the blunt one and rolled a fat, deadly one
God is coming she's just taking her time (haha!)
I am contemplating plots, wondering where the thought will go
Brothas being shot, returning risen
Dem a revealing lie, but holding a bird in a cloud
Have you ever seen a crack addict? That's eternal fire
Memories of a past time, giving cash to leaders
It's hard enough living in these greedy times
They say that Jesus is a kind man
Using the lord's name in vain
Are these niggas still talking?
Hysterical and spiritual lyrics like The Holy Quran
Let me introduce you to the topic, then we drop it
Watch me go up, located all over the world as the art of graffiti
Born into a drug addict titty, in every city
I, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Looking for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
West coast rider, comes right behind you
You should never have fucked me
Please reconsider before dying
But it's my life or yours, and first I'm a bomb
I have to lose, I have nowhere to go
So what's your damn purpose? Storytelling service
But I'm from Jers, we don't play that shit
From Clare to North Bricks, all my niggas flippin 'chips
Tryna crawls through these halls and fights without a scar
Shoot first, look at his head, explode bleeding
We bombard first when we ride
G's and niggas thugs on the rise
We bombard first when we ride
Please reconsider before dying
Let's pray, my nigga
Because we have definitely sinned
Dough kicks, putting holes in mothafuckas leaving hoes removed
Nigga lay you down when I crawl on a mission to send you six feet
I positioned myself to blow up, indicate the path that you say
You pay a bitch, I'll pay a corrupt cop
Then hurry up on the block and stack my money that I will plan in the future
These bitches and the vultures that surround my group
My head talking to my damn stretched car
Another dead motherfucker, lying in red
As he bloodied his damn mug photo
You risk lives when you fucking make soldiers (I told you so)
I keep spitting, still stupid niggas don't listen
Except some who want more from life than stress.
You are a cold black in those pigs
"Free 2Pac" is everything on a black man's mind
But at the same time, it seems like they're trying to take mine
Niggas act like they're wild, I'll go get the cabbage
I have nothing but love for my niggas who live luxuriously
And i can make you famous
I live in fear of a serious crime
If you have it, better show off
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
It's like cousin, blood band hitting
Everyone at the party doing silly things
You can get your first start before your eyes swirl
And then you work so hard until your hair turns gray
Floating in the black Benz (Biatch), trying to do one show a day
Now the Lakers handle this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
Does the gangsta run this motherfucker?
Or do the ladies run this motherfucker?
(It's a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
West side at this fucking party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
Deathrow at its finest
One love, west coast, one love
And I don't need a gang, my Glocks look like a pocket full of rocks
Fifty the first one who can drop me
Now make a way here, I come with a clip
Mad circle mutilates motherfuckers
Khakis and his steel toe boots is how we roll
Catch them sliding behind the scenes, start shitting
So go home, here comes that crazy nigga who shoots the postman and innocent bystanders
Wicked, wicked, Oak Town-style
Like Nike, I never have to ask questions
All it takes is a place, a place, a time and a rhyme.
Out of the trunk with this funky attitude
Yes!
The MCs take their time, before starting the rhyme
Kill a nigga, kill a nigga
Yeah let's break them something (with that funky funky style)
So I start kicking, funky ass shit [?]
Living from homeland, here is my goal
Let this microphone pump
Stressed but busta free
To be the last motherfucker to breathe
Now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
I woke up to 50 enemies plotting my death
The 50 visions of me watching shot in the chest
Bless me father I'm a sinner I'm living in hell
Gaining worldwide exposure
With a bunch of niggas who don't give a shit, riding like my soldiers
The enemies give me reasons
Bustin 'my automatic rounds
Catch them while they sleep
Make sure you hold my position, stay firm on the ground
Ask Yak, he'll tell you it's hell down here
I'm still breathing
With these fagot ass niggas, transparent ass niggas
Just ass niggas riding my cock and the skin of my mash
Bustin 'my automatic rounds
I walk with a knife in my back
Breathing in the sewer stink, nobody gives a shit
In the belly of the beast, that's where we come from
And I'm still breathing!
I just lost two of my closest na'r, one of you can take this
Shit, Pac is still doing it, your hoes can't ruin it
Two million every time it falls, I know you bastards lose it
Style niggas, thugs and thugs, give up! We hit them!
(Who will be the last motherfuckers to breathe?)
Who will be the last motherfuckers to breathe?
Bustin 'my automatic rounds
Bustin ', my automatic rounds
Stressed, but without bust
Enemies give me reasons to be the last motherfucker to breathe
The fifty visions you see of me shot in the chest
A black thug screaming "West Side", bustin 'Double Glocks
With a bunch of niggas that don't give a FUCK, riding like my soldiers
Bustin ', my automatic rounds
Stressed, but without bust
Rather I know your N.I.G.G.A. if you still leave me
A world mafia figga, a local nightmare, just call them right there
Some have prophesied, murder, some have tried
Now Brenda never really knew her mothers.
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family.
I went out and had a children's church
But nobody seems to notice any change in his figure
He wrapped the baby up and threw it in the trash.
I guess he thought he would leave, he wouldn't hear the screams
Mom can't help her, but it hurts to hear her call
Brenda wants to run away
She tried to sell crack but ended up being robbed
She has a baby
Oh
Buried
Maybe in our shed dreams it's reality
Niggas says a love
A nation
Retaliation, perpetrate punish you, how could you
Look at me
Hard to imagine I knew this nigger for eternity
I keep stomping with my gun in my tail
We fight to live and fight (Fight to live and fight)
Your fight (your life)
What are you going to do?
Now if my memory serves me justly
And now I have this gun pointed at your mouth, ready to squeeze
Brothaz in arms
The end is
Overcome all problems
Let's do it now
(What? Say what?)
Uh
All soldiers be my friends
Puffin on blunt and drunk so as not to sink
Losing myself in madness, dull getting drunk
Your time to expire, no one cries, every man has to die
Pour some liquor down the sidewalk for the trapped niggas
Bullet the brain!
Go to hell with my finger on the trigger
Bullet the brain!
If I could capture the anger of today's youth and bottle it
From parents who couldn't raise them because they are lazy
So it sucks [?]
Dear Lord, can you hear me? I'm just me.
Dear Lord, can you hear me when I die?
Tell me how can i survive
Will I live or die?
Excuse me sir
The streets are full of enemies, take care of me
Even when I die I don't care
Something about this game that keeps an awful cry for pain
??? so I took the blow for granted, and a revolver will be my only hope to escape, talking about doing the same
But the feeling can wait, who can you blame on these downtown streets?
No, I'm not afraid, just be careful it's top notch
Bury me a g, bury me a g, thug life knows what time it is, feel me
Finger on the trigger when a nigga ride
Pick up my money from the floor, God bless all four
I don't have time for bitches
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Pick up calls to my old bitches, send more pictures
Keep my finger on my mac man
Niggas stumbling in this rap game, bury me a G
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
So you want to earn a million?
This is how you motherfuckers try to play me and my friends
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
God knows I don't need another DUI
I lead a thug life, heartless swindler
"Is it great to fuck?" That's what I'm asking
I let a trick be a trick, you can have that bitch
(cause) I don't have time for bitches
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
California knows how to have fun
In the city of L.A
In the city of good old watts
In the city, the city of Compton.
We in that sunny state where the hemp bomb is
And the pimps are on a mission for them green
Diamonds shining, looking like I stole Liberace
Your city is the bomb if your city is paying
We keep it rocking, we keep it rocking
Fiendin 'for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where the cowards die and the strong ball
Flossin 'but be careful: we collided with other crews
It's Westside, so you know Row won't bow to any man
Say what you say but give me Dre's bombshell
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
California knows how to have fun
In the city of good old watts
We keep it rocking, we keep it rocking
Uh yeah Oaktown
Yes, inglewood
Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby
Because you and I know it's the best side
Gangsta fuck
Oh me, Pac
Let these motherfuckers know what kind of party they're in right now
You are a cold black in those pigs
Now I'm back in the room, waiting for the result
"Free 2Pac" is everything on a black man's mind
See, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker
If you have it, better show off
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
Throw your damn hands in the air, you know what I mean?
As soon as I enter the scene, I hear hoochie screams
In Los Angeles we use Chucks, not Ballys
Around the world, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back
Cali is where they left their mack, give me love!
Californian love
California knows how to have fun
In the city of good old watts
In the city, the city of Compton.
What the hell's wrong with you East Side?
California knows how to have fun
In the city of good old watts
Shake, shake, mom
Shit doesn't stop, it doesn't stop
Rotate that thought right before you start
Californian love!
Now let me welcome you all to the wild, wild west
An untouchable state like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a bullet to your chest
I've been in the game for ten years making rap songs
Now it's 95 and they look at me and look at me
In the city of good old watts (good old watts)
In town, Compton town (Compton town)
Shake it, shake it baby, shake it, shake it, shake it baby
Shake it, shake it mom, shake it Cali
In the city of L.A. (South Central)
In the city of good old Watts (Uh, that's correct)
Shake it, shake it mom, shake it Cali (Shake it, Cali)
California knows how to have fun
California knows how to have fun (where are uh)
In town, Compton town (in Compton town)
Shake it mom, shake it baby, shake it, shake it baby, shake it, shake it
Real niggas fingers on 9 nickel plated triggers
You yell, "Go 2Pac!" and I won't stop until it's well paid
And you will never notice
My shit is coming out of the record store like it's a pharmacy
D-R-E, you have me hot; my words like a penitentiary cock
Bail on these hoes in dental floss mode
My deceased enemies
Oh! Where did he go?
You should never have put my rhymes with Dre
And I can make you famous jealous niggas
Niggas knows me player I gotta be faithful
You can not see me
I'm in the flesh, darling, but you can't see me
Thug Life, baby
I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers!
You can not see me
Right in front of your eyes, you won't even notice
Scared fucking bitch, yeah
Dave Duke sure looks cute in that black suit Oooohhh
And the tingling of the brain cells I feel stronger than a damn crazy Dingo
And we don't need more statistics
Going down 405, watch out for strangers
Hand on my 4-5; that's what fame does
Pass me the grass, let Hennessey come to me
Before the penitentiary, go ahead!
I'm fucking evil with people like my gang
Some say the government will monitor me
Trust, I have my beach armed with Glock if they press me
Better duck because I'm not looking when I'm - b-blaaastin
And every day is just a fight
Keep swinging on these suckas until they bury you
Ready to burst
I'm fucking evil with people like my gang
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot a man, but nothing will stop the plan of the real blacks
Can you feel the pride of the pantha?
As it shines in splendor and grace
of his career progression
while she cares for her young man completely alone
One Love One Life
You can see ... the pride of the panther
In the concrete jungle, alone with her cub.
How does it shine in splendor and grace?
Can you see the pride in the panther?
The seed must grow independently
Of the fact that it's planted in stone
Stays bright like the rays of the sun
Tearing down the placed obstacles
Eclipse all rays of the sun
Shine like the rays of the sun!
Shine like the rays of the sun (come on)
Stay high as a new day has begun, say
To shine like the rays of the sun (uh-huh)
BRIGHT BRIGHTNESS LIKE THE SUN RAYS (whoo!)
Stay high as a new day started (ha ha)
Stay high as a new day started (ha ha)
Carry out like a new day started
A new day began, a new day began
Power to the people! (Power to the people)
Love is the power of people (LOVE)
As if we love love ... a love
And this is an act of love
Who I am? A panther
What I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE
Put your hands up in the air if you feel like me
What I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE
What I got I got PRIDE, what I want to be FREE
And outshines the rays of the sun
Shines like the sun
The R holds her down at the end out of respect
Who I am? A panther
Put your hands up in the air if you feel like me
I know you have a man, but he won't mind if I take you out
Oh sure, what's wrong with your eye?
It's like your man doesn't understand, all he does is stress you out
It's not about not sucking and touching, just a harmless discussion
I have you trembling when I'm standing near you
All it does is hit you hard
Tell me, can you get away?
Can you escape
I'm not happy here (Do you love that man?)
But you were different, I have no need to suspect
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips made me addicted
I'm sitting here hoping we can find some way to kick it
I want to take you there but you are afraid to continue
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sadness
And I can't escape (did he hit you?)
You and I were meant to be my destiny, not alone
I refuse to give up, because I believe in what we share
You are living in prison and what he is giving cannot be compared
‘Because everything I feel for you I want to let you know
So much pressure in the air (Can't you escape why?)
I'm not trying to put you in a position
You need, but now ... he's not even taking care of you
Let me show you what this life is really about
I need to go to Hawaii, see the world
‘Because this black fact became jealous. Don't cry, everything is fine
Shake that man, walk away
Can you see the pride of the panther?
Give it more volume
You're a bit silly for love, right?
Should have seen
I hear you call me to come back, I'm a suck for love
I will never dance again, hahahaha, that is correct
You try to catch me, say you're pregnant and guess who's the dad
Tell me who knows, a quiet place where I can go
The way that I danced with you
It wasn't always a successful relationship
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
("It's nothing more than a gangsta ...")
("It's nothing more than a gangsta party")
Let them know ... black
Count money while I hit it, dog
Now go on while we ride
And i can make you famous
I live in fear of a serious crime
Defeat is not my destiny, set me free on the streets
Jealousy is misery, suffering is greed
They wonder how I live with five shots.
There are no answers to the questions, I'm trying to get up
("It's nothing more than a gangsta party")
Nothing but a gangsta party
Nothing but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the world gangsta party
you saw innocence at its best
2 wake up 2 u every morning
AHA! Yes, my friends can fight but we don't fall
Uh yeah my friends can fight but we don't fall
There is no living soul that breathes, it will not pump fear here
