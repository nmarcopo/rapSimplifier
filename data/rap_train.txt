Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks

I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga

I never was one for the bragging and boasting
You know what the outcome will be

It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga

Made man stamped, I got "21" stamped
I was down, bad and now I'm shining like a lamp
You put a ring on her, she ain't nothing but a tramp
They kicked me outta middle school and sent me to the house
We 'bout that gunplay, nigga, motherfuck 'yo count
19, I bought a Cutlass, four 12's and an amp
Beating down Glenwood, nigga, feeling like a champ
Lil nigga we ain't snitchin', we ain't making no sound
Used to jump niggas, now we jumping in a crowd
Used to make my mama cry, but now I make her proud
I remember rainy days but now she like the sound
I'm thinking to myself you ain't gang, nigga, fuck you
If he had the password to your phone he wouldn't have cuffed you
Dog ass bitch, I knew I never should've trusted you
Hoe stab a nigga in the back like the streets do
Can't believe that you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you
Gang, gang, screaming "Fuck you, they want to eat you"
... on yo' baby-momma face an' nutted on her brain
The dick left her hunchback like Notre Dame
If I jump out with the yoppa, you gon' snitch on me
Ain't got no license but I'm [?] with a whole block

Lyrics from Snippet
Like, 'cause I was born overseas, these muhfuckers ain't gon' spray-spray
Pull up in your hood, nigga, 9-1-1, y'all better call mayday
From Glenwood all the way to Martin Luther King, niggas know we don't play-play
Lyrics from Snippet
Left the crime scene like I was never there
Put a hundred shots in his [?]
Diamonds in my piss, won't shake hands with a snitch
It ain't hard to find me, I'm in the cater of the city
High-speed chase, I can't get caught with the stick
Valentine's Day, I play 2K and that's it
You took her out to eat and then she sucked on his dick
Maybach V12, big dawg status
Get your ass whacked, I got a homicide fetish
Come pick up your bitch, I put my hot dog in her relish
Your baby mama test me, she want hot dog in her belly
How these niggas still gang-gang and they tellin'?
She'll point a finger, but in private, she be stealin'
Thirty models in the house, I gave 'em each a minute
Yeah, you know, it's thirty models in the house, really
They say, "Use your time wisely," so I gave each of 'em a minute
Know what I'm sayin'? They enjoyed it too
You know it's enough of me to go around, don't be stingy
I'm in a Rover with a shooter
I got thirty hollows in this Ruger
And my Glock give lessons, it's a tutor
I ain't with the jibber jab, give your ass the quickest jab
I'm the type to buy a Bentley, you the type to skip a tab

Lyrics from snippet:
You hoes coachin', I get lit with Saint Laurent bitches
I'm a Backwoods nigga, you a lil' swisher
I used to pull a bitch off with a lil' pistol
Yeah
VVS look like a star, yeah
I took the top off the car
We don't abide by the law (No)
You don’t know what I done saw (Saw)
Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)
I keep a stick for the war (Stick)
Checks I deposit (Checks I deposit)
Lot of model bitches check for me
I kept a stick like a hobo, no checkin' me
So many hoes, had to get a vasectomy
She left her body home and brought her neck to me
I did a walk-through, they sent a jet to me
Y'all niggas show price less than my travel fee
One of my arms worth a ticket
Watch so much that a car came with it
And I went to school high, I ain't go to class though
I was with the OGs learnin' 'bout the glass bowl
Caught me with a deuce five, mama kicked my ass, bro
Break yourself, leave his brains on the dashboard
We got four choppers that’s full (21)
Way before rappin’, on God, I was trappin', sneakin’ my Glock in Lacura (On God)
I got my K from Osama Bin Laden, lil' nigga he signed this shit (Straight up)
I'm 4L gang, if you reach for my chain, then a nigga gon' die in this bitch (On God)
A-B-C-D-E-F-G Wagon, y’all niggas doin' that big cappin' (21)
I ain't with the friendly shit
Closest thing y'all gettin' to a handshake is the beat clappin' (21)
Your mama gon' have to make a GoFundMe, y'all niggas keep doing that sneak jabbin' (Straight up)
Gucci had to kill the whole woods
Just to make Young Savage this motherfuckin' mink jacket (21)
VVS look like a star, yeah
I took the top off the car
We don't abide by the law (No)
You don't know what I just saw (Saw)
Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)
I keep a stick for the war (Stick)
Checks I deposit (Checks I deposit)
Money just stick with the boy
Cash in and cash out (Cash in and cash out)
I am not lookin' for clout (Nah)
I knew I would figure it out (I knew)
Popped a pill got my head in the cloud (Huh)
Say my name, it'll bring out a crowd (Crowd)
We got paid, now my family proud (On God)
I been drippin' this drip since a child
I hit your bitch, she a jump off
Cartier bracelets for her, they don't come off
They get the swag from Atlanta and run off
I make the boys swing the stick like a tomahawk
Runnin' this shit, what the fuck is they talkin' 'bout?
Skinny jeans stuffed with them hundreds, they poke out
S65, I'm in a robot
I'm a real one, ain't running from nobody
Hellcat fast, you know that I show out
Ain't sparin' no bitch, give a fuck 'bout a blowout
If we wanna smoke with you, boy, you can't go out
Still gettin' money my label don't know 'bout
Court-side with the vibe with her toes out
Rich nigga, I come straight out the poor house
Trap goin' crazy right there by Morehouse
Bought a Benz, doubled back, bought a trap house
I'm with Savage in the 6 doin' donuts (Skrrt)
Youngins with me, they got fire, they gon' go nuts
Quarter-million in a baby blue Goyard
Buy it cash then I go in the motor
Drive fast, ain't no pullin' me over
Play with bags, you can tell by the odor
No alcohol, go get me a new soda
VVS look like a star, yeah
I took the top off the car
We don't abide by the law (No)
You don't know what I just saw (Saw)
Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)
I keep a stick for the war (Stick)
Money just stick with the boy
I don't gotta get no award, yeah
Live in the bank, don't do fraud, yeah
200 racks on my arm, yeah
I been fuckin' superstars, yeah
Her pussy good, buy her a car yeah
You niggas ain't makin' no noise, yeah
You niggas ain't makin' no noise (On God)

Lyrics from Snippet
... hot sauce
Got a nigga baby mama
Never turn my back for fame
Rags to riches, nigga came from the bottom
Hood rats, now a nigga fuckin' on models
Ridin' in the foreign, remember ridin' on MARTA
Grind got harder and my mind got smarter
I was gettin' bags for the cheap
When I ain't had money, I was robbin', nigga
I was gettin' bags for the free
21 Gang, they were right beside me
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover
Niggas tryna clone a nigga's shit, damn, woah
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo
Niggas want a handout, shit, mine broke
Niggas rappin' 'bout shit they ain't even lived
Niggas lyin', I can hear it in their ad-libs
It's kinda fucked up what they did to Black, damn
If I catch him in the trap, I'ma whack him
I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'ma whack him
Nigga, try to keep up with this fashion
They dependent on their daddy
Tryin' not to let the streets distract me
I know it's bumps in the road like acne
I'm a solid young nigga, you can ask C
The internet ain't gon' help you understand me
I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gangbangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'
And I come through when the gang need
And I wear shades so they can't see
And I pay them lawyers and the bond fees
Nigga one thousand, I'm beyond G
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy
Niggas still askin', "Can you front me?"
My old ho sayin', "Boy you growed up"
Promethazine, it got a nigga slowed up
Too solid, pussy niggas can't disclose us
Went and seen Eliantte, and he froze us
Savage Mode drop, now my price'll go up
Streets cold, nigga, they ain't showin' no love
Niggas get in front of judge and they fold up
Face shot, hit that boy with the whole dub
I'm a street nigga, yeah I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gangbangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
Jumped out the Porsche, got to it
Choppa on me, bitch I shoot like I'm Cupid
Model bitch, and she gon' blow me like hookah (yeah)
All these diamonds, bitch I look like a jeweler (21!)
Tech 9, bitch it came with a cooler
I got shooters that'll shoot at your shooter (yeah)
Bitch you broke, you eatin' noodles and oodles (21)
I got a bad bitch, workin' Hooters (21)
Bitch I get the check, and you know I blew it (21) (I get it)
21 gang, chain hangin', blangin' (21)
Jewish lawyers, give a fuck about that rangin' (21)
Seinfeld, niggas frontin' like Kramer
Put you on the news, you wanna be famous (21)
Zoom on six, bitch you know that I claimed it
I jumped out the Porsche and broke my ankle (gang, gang)
I'm scrapin' the bud when I cook it up (21)
Your main bitch want me to pick her up (21)
Your jewelry shinin'? We gon' stick you up (stick ya up)
Like 2Pac, nigga, hit 'em up (hit 'em up)
These niggas tough on the Internet (21)
Gettin' that pussy, I'm killin' that (I'm killin')
I'm not just a rapper, I'm livin' that (I'm livin' that)
These niggas broke, I heard these niggas shoppin' J.C. Penny (21, 21)
I'm a real nigga, I can't wear no gold unless they came from the [?]

I keep me extended clips
Young savage, Fresh Jones
I just poured a 4 inside a Jones
I might take your baby mama home
She gon' suck me up and give me dome
Rap niggas I ain't really with it
Put some bullet holes in your fitted
She let me nut on her titty
If I say shovel, I dig it
Gangbanging like I'm Suge
Red rag in my Dickies
Slaughter Gang bitch I claim that
Diss me, get aimed at
Fuck around and get your chain snatched
How much you pay for your chain back?
Aye I pull up to the Yo with a chopper and my son
Slaughter Gang bomb shit, nigga like Saddam
100 round drum on my stick
50 round drum on my hip
I pull up and let the shit rip
Bankroll like I'm Tip
Flipping work, acrobatic
Who the fuck want static
Young savage bitch I'm shhh
Catch a nigga ass in traffic
Roll it down and let him have it
We the ones causing havoc
Cooking up cocaine
Smoking on propane
I can't wife a hoe, mane
I just want throat, mane
I keep a 30 on my waist
Homicide, I beat the case
Spray the stick like it's some mace
Get your whole block erased
I get the shit from across the border
You play with the gang, you'll get slaughtered
Pull up on your bitch and slaughter
Fresh eating a turkey burger
His chopper make you do the Shmurda
Free that nigga Bobby Shmurda
You niggas know I rep that murder
These niggas sneak dissing, I know it
Blowing money like I'm Floyd
Knock a nigga out like Floyd
I just went to cop a Porsche
I just went to cop a Rolls
Your favorite rapper is a hoe
Aye I pull up to the Yo with a chopper and my son
Slaughter Gang bomb shit, nigga like Saddam
100 round drum on my stick
50 round drum on my hip
I pull up and let the shit rip
Flipping work, acrobatic
Who the fuck want static
Young savage bitch I'm shhh
Catch a nigga ass in traffic
Roll the window down and shhh
We the ones causing havoc
So cold
My heart so cold
My heart so cold, I can never fold
I’m on the paper chase man, fuck these hoes
I’m poppin’ pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle ‘cause I hate being broke
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
My heart so cold, I’m sticking to the code
Fake niggas bend, real niggas don’t fold
I’m tricking J’s daily, selling sheetrock for blow
Still got it for the low
Judge give you the book, hang your ass without a rope
When you at the bottom seem like you ain’t got hope
Green dots at funerals, they got my head fucked up
Pussy niggas shot me six times, my luck fucked up
Hundred band lick pussy nigga, now I’m fucked up
My heart so cold, I can never fold
I’m on the paper chase man, fuck these hoes
I’m poppin’ pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle ‘cause I hate being broke
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
Fast paper had me dropping out of school
Smoking marijuana, riding with them tools
Hanging ‘round hustlers, robbers, and fools
Hand to hand with strangers, watching from an angle
Praying for an angel, protection from danger
Cause I done seen plenty niggas died that had a banger
And I done seen them niggas’ partner ride out of anger
And never came back, about them greenbacks
And just because we paid, the stress don’t decay
Still thinking ‘bout them losses, winning never made ‘em fade
With Gs being dead and [?] on my mental
It hurt so bad that I can’t do the shit I didn’t do
To keep my niggas here with me, I swear that shit be killing me
I hope you niggas feelin’ me ‘cause I know that you hearing me
And just because we smile and play
That don’t mean that everything is going ok, no
That don’t mean that everything is going ok
My heart so cold, I can never fold
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
Help me, can you help me?

Pull up on your bitch and give her that skrr
Pull up on your bitch and drop that work

Bitches getting slaughtered, man these bitches getting slayed
Keep that Glock 40, dare a nigga to touch my chain
I shoot this motherfucker like my name Max Payne
Help me, can you help me?
I just cooked another brick, can you help me?
Help me, can you help me?
I pulled up in a Fisker then I pulled off in a Tesla
Thought this shit was sweet, I left his ass on a stretcher
I don't catch feelings, I'm too busy catching death tolls
I'm a dog like Michael Vick
I used to sell them Michael Vicks
I can't even lie, I ain't never sold a brick
But I got some partners who done really sold them bricks
Run up on a nigga, better take a nigga shit
If your diamond's hitting you could take a nigga bitch
I hit four hundred and went a bought a 'vette
Your diamonds so cloudy, who the fuck sold you that shit?
You know damn well don't no Rolex fucking tick
Get your motherfucking money up nigga, try again nigga, 21
Dope got wet, it gotta dry again
Pussy ass rappers telling lies again
Pussy ass, bitch ass fuck boy
Help me, can you help me?
I got fifty bags of gas, can you help me?
I just cooked another brick, can you help me?

October '92 when you pushed me out (Straight up)
It was only right that I made a song about you (Straight up)
Ain’t no tellin' where I'd be if I went without you (On God)
Wish I woulda stayed in school, but I dropped out (On God)
You taught me how to be strong, gotta give praise (21)
When the times got hard, you always made ways (On God)
Even though I barely got the new Js (On God)
You made sure the kid kept a temp fade (Straight up)
And you kept my PlayStation with some new games (Straight up)
And you buy me freeze cups with your loose change (Facts)
My daddy never was around, that nigga too lame (Fuck ’em)
I think that's why I quit school and started to shoot thangs (21)
My mama taught me how to tie my shoes (On God)
Mama told me don't spend all my money with a jeweler
I bought some real estate plus I'm investin' in my shooters (21, 21)
Had to write a letter to my ma dukes (Ma dukes)
I know you proud of me, but I'm proud, too (I'm proud, too)
I’m still your baby even though I got a child, too (Straight up)
I paid it off, ain’t no mortgage or no rent due (Facts)
Yes, she got a Range Rover and a Benz, too (On God)
Ma, you never left my side and I thank you (21)
I seen you strugglin’, I think it left a scar (Left a scar)
I did some things when I was young that broke your heart (Broke your heart)
I'm the one that stole the cookies out the jar (Out the jar)
I'm the one that went and stole the neighbor's car (Neighbor’s car)
Times got hard, started sellin' hard (Sellin' hard)
Before I see you stressin', I'm gonna break the law (Break the law)
I was sellin' weed, I never mowed the lawn (Mowed the lawn)
Commit a burglary and take it to the pawn (Straight to the pawn)
When I went to YDC you was there (On God)
If I had a school hearing, you was there (That's a fact)
Back when you had the Ford minivan, let me drive to Citi Trends
Baggy-ass Girbauds and some Timberlands (Straight up, straight up)
You didn't never pick a side, told me, "Be a man" (Straight up)
I'ma raise my kids, nothin' like my dad, I'm a better dad
You're the best mama I could ever have (On God)
Had to write a letter to my ma dukes (Ma dukes)
I know you proud of me, but I'm proud, too (I'm proud, too)
I'm still your baby even though I got a child, too (Straight up)
I paid it off, ain't no mortgage or no rent due (Facts)
Yes, she got a Range Rover and a Benz, too (On God)
It's a hard job, but women raise men, too (21)
Ma, you never left my side and I thank you (21)

Blow your hood up like Osama, dog
Young  Savage with the drama, dog
I'm still fuckin' niggas mommas, dog
Skrrt,  skrrt, watch the pot scrape

I'm still dippin' in my old pay
Last  year money, nigga, in my old safe
2013, that's a old Wraith
2017, it's a new May
Hit your ass so many times, you need a new face
Saint Laurent Don, this ain't Burberry
Nigga, do you wanna be a obituary
Kick you out the car, 'cause you too scared
Give you a hot one, nigga, this a hot gun
We don't stop shootin' 'till the cops come
Yo bitch basic, bitch nigga face it

Jump out with that yoppa', whatchu talkin' bout, nigga

I got that Nick Cannon, brought the drum out, nigga
You niggas cuff to much, and I'm up too much
You can't talk to me lil' bitch, you ride the bus too much
They kicked me out of elementary, used to hunch too much
Used to skip class and go to school for lunch too much
Nigga, fuck you, yeah, you too
And my bitch ass fat like Bruce, Bruce
I got a model bitch, she only eat cous-cous
Don't brung me 'round your plug, I hit them folks
Don't brung me 'round your girl, I hit them folks
I ran off on your partner and I'm with all the smoke
'Nother nigga from the Six, lil' bitch
'Nother nigga with the shits, lil' bitch

Think I'm slippin', it's on my hip, lil' bitch
Glock .40 make you tick, lil' bitch
Fukk 12
A hundred a zip and I'm sippin' on drop

I pulled up on her and panties just drop
Up 32 shots and you niggas gon' drop
Off with your top (head), give a fuck bout your block 1 2
High speed chasing, give a fuck bout the cops
Niggas be rappin, I came up off rocks
They tried to betray me
I'm mad at myself cause I keep it real with all these niggas
Niggas actin like bitches, niggas all in they feelings
These niggas acting like women
Drowning in money, I'm swimmin'
These bitches acting like pigeons
I just want a couple million, I just want a couple million
And I'm still loyal to the gang
These other niggas man, they lame

Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
I just beat another case

Brand new rollie with the face
No face, no case
I had to lose a lot of friends, nigga tryna chase them m's
Cooking up crack its illegal, riding with a Desert Eagle
I'm a felon, that's illegal, main bitch, she illegal
Hunnid pounds of Cali reefer, Call of duty heat seeker
Pull up on ya in a Regal, window down nigga creeping
Nigga rapping? I'm preachin', nigga we are not equal
In the trenches, niggas beefing, I remember not sleeping
Hit the club and get to squeezing, shoot it up for no reason
I was living like a demon, I was living like a demon
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
I just went and bought a Wraith

Brand new rollie with the face
No face, no case
I met a new Migo, He said he got kilos

I used to sell dope, nigga, now I can't vote (Vote)
Poppin' Percocets to kill the pain, I can't cope (God)
Anger in my genes, they used to hang us up with ropes (21)
Civil rights came so they flood the hood with coke (Real)
Breakin' down my people, tryna kill our faith and hope (Hope)
They killed Martin Luther King and all he did was spoke (21)

Another nigga from the hood tryna ball too (Ball for real)
Grind hard, nigga, grind hard, I done grind hard
Late nights playin' b-ball with a decoy
I was on the corner with the robbers and the d-boys
Now I'm on the charts, man, this shit is unbelievable
Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin' (21, 21)
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'
You pussy ass niggas, I ain’t on nothin'
Wanna see me fucked up 'cause they poor hustlin'
The same niggas with me back when I was head itchin'
Man I'm having nightmares that the feds listenin'
The coupe fast and it's fucking up the dash digits
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
It's a bag on his head, I'ma pick it up
It was money in the house, I used to stick it up
Dick ridin', niggas always tryna flick it up
I ain't tryna take no pictures, bitch I'm rollin' Swishers
I count my back end then I jump out with that pistol
If you ain't suckin' dick you get a early dismissal
We got your wifey at the spot, she tryna lick a pickle
I just went and bought a Lamb and it cost a nickel
And I went platinum, still in the hood
And I take the gang with me everywhere I go
Why these niggas hatin' on me? Man I don't know
And I got a hundred racks inside a Go-Go
And I get a hundred racks for a show, show
Wanna give a bitch my heart but I can't though
I can't fall in love with a stank ho
And you know I love that good drank, ho
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money and I ride 'round with that Tommy
And I put it in her stomach and I made that lil' bitch ride me
You're my old school runner, you're my old school runner
But my new school runnin', it costs more than a hundred
You lil' niggas so bummy (21)
Make a diss song, they gon' wrap you like a mummy
My young niggas geekin' on boot like zombies
They hungry, up it on you then they tell you, "Run it"
I stole cars, drove them like go-karts (facts)
Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts (cat)
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it
I'm just tryna take care of the family
And I'm sippin' Codeine, not Brandy (21)
And I'm sippin' Codeine, I'm an addict
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?
I almost lost my life when I was trappin'
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

I'm so motherfucking picky

Cuz I'm so motherfucking picky
Thousand dollars on Giuseppe's
You better watch where you stepping
Eighty thousand on a necklace
Cuz I'm so motherfucking picky
I'm fucking picky, 21 Savage all I do is count digits
I cook a brick, I flip a brick, I fucking whip it
I hit Lenox, spend ten, I'm fucking ridiculous
I pulled up on his bitch, she acting stiff
Bitch you better suck a dick or you gotta dip
I got real shooters 'round me, they gone fucking flip
You don't see this fucking extendo, better watch ya lip
Cuz we'll trip nigga
The money come first and these bitches last nigga
I like counting cash nigga, I like smoking gas nigga
All my bitches thick, I love a fat ass
I'm so motherfucking picky
She ain't fucking then she dipping
If it ain't tinted, I ain't in it
Cuz I'm so motherfucking picky
Thousand dollars on Giuseppe's
You better watch where you stepping
I'm young, dumb and I'm reckless
Eighty thousand on a necklace
Cuz I'm so motherfucking picky
I'm young dumb and I'm reckless
This dope came from Peru, I got a deuce deuce in my shoe
I got santan, wanna boot?

These niggas lying I'm the truth
21 Savage, I'm in love with the money
Got a hundred round drum, on the bottom of my Tommy
Baw baw baw! graw graw graw!
Pussy nigga get to running, boot up, boot up, like a motherfucking zombie

21 Savage
21, 21
Slaughter,  slaughter, slaughter
Your daughter, your daughter, your daughter
21, 21, 21 21 21
Pull up in yo trap niggas scatter like roaches
All my close friends drug dealers and vultures
I'm sippin' out a coffee cup but this ain't Folgers
I know you still mad about the brick that I sold
I cook me up a brick and went and bought me a Rollsie
I'm playin' with the rock like my real name is Hova
AK-47 still strapped to my shoulder
Them niggas tote choppers like them niggas from Magnolia
I fucked another nigga's bitch
When you gettin' money you can fuck a nigga's bitch
VVS diamonds I done flooded out my wrist
You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When you tryna get this money for a brick
Reaching in your pocket feelin' lit
Fuck that I'm running off with niggas' shit
All the codeine and gas money spent
You had bands now you ain't even got a zip
Fuck that you better take a nigga's shit
Take a nigga's shit you better take a nigga's shit
I just took a nigga's shit and flooded out my wrist
Rappin' ass nigga you ain't really with the shit
You ain't never sold no coke and you ain't never hit a lick
Man we pull up like the Secret Service, nothin' 'bout no sticks
Mess with 21 Savage, they gon' put you on a list
When you tryna get this money for a brick
Reaching in your pocket feelin' lit
Fuck that I'm running off with niggas' shit
All the codeine and gas money spent
You had bands now you ain't even got a zip
All your homeboys fuckin' on your bitch
Fuck that you better take a nigga's shit
Lyrics from Snippet
Nigga, gun smoke, late night
Nigga, gun smoke, any time
Gun smoke, anybody
We'll come and see about it
Got your buddy killed about it
Y'all ain't did shit about it, pussy
You know how I'm rockin' in this bitch, pussy
You know it get to poppin' in this bitch, pussy
I ain't goin' to war about a bitch, pussy
I ain't talkin' to the law about shit, pussy
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell you not a rapper
Who you with? What you claim?
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace
I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now
10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace
I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'ma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace
I been in the crib with the phones off
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wri
Who else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G though
I'm trying to tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
I live fast die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go
And tell me today's weather
I know they say they good, but trust me I'm better
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really it's whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking
These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he don't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to get buried
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary
But I ain't playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords
I do it better than the best could
You know what it is, Drake and Tim Westwood
Yeah, yeah
Boomin out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm (Lou)
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like MacGyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Work, work the night shift)
Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with nigga's souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm at or who I saw or
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
I got car money, fresh start money
I want women to cry and pour out they heart for me
And tell me how much they hate it when they apart from me
Tell 'em I love 'em and don't ever mean it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient, I ain't lying
Yeah, and comfortable I sit
That manual Ferrari Italia's some fly shit
It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'
This nigga girl, but to me she wasn't
Been hot before they open doors for me, pre-heated oven
My newest girl from back home got issues with parents
And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?
Luckily, I'm the greatest my country's ever seen
So chances are I get the border to issue me clearance
Dreams money can buy
That's only 'cause I been waiting on it, nigga
So fuck whoever hating on a nigga
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
We talked music for hours, she never mentioned ya
YMCMB
When I know part of it's envy
I take 'em off in the house because the throw carpets are Fendi
Ooh! I never seen the car you claim to drive
Or, shit, I seen it; you just ain't inside
And I feel like lately, it went from top five to remaining five
And they tryna bring us down, me, Weezy, and Stunna
We stayed up, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
Then I'll probably give her my number
Yeah, I throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage you dance on
We got company coming over
They told me it's like a high, and it wasn't a lie, yeah
Just have some good pussy waiting on a nigga
Aw, yeah
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (Don't)
Don't
Don't
I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay
So if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat
Now you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eat
Keep gettin' temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
You're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then you
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time
Y'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin' me hits
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin' with my name
And I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
Tell 'Ye we got a invoice comin' to you
Considerin' that we just sold another 20 for you
To be honest
Duppy
Yeah
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
She tryna take it all off for me (Tryna take it all off)
Tryna stay real close to me (She tryna stay real close)
I can't play myself, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Railiza (Ow!), you need a... money and visa
And you get what you want, always from me
Howisha, you need a... (Ow!) baby with me, uh
I can't say "No" when you say "Please," I can't say "No" (Ow!)
You want a supermodel pose like mi real friend Winnie (Like mi real friend)
Yeah, vacation is done, but I'm not finished, no
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (Slow)
I'm gone on them once I get going (Gone on them, gone on them, gone on them) (Ow!)
She tryna take it all off for me (Close) (Tryna take it all off)
Tryna stay real close to me (She tryna stay real close)
I gotta catch myself (I gotta catch myself)
I can't play myself, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
I bet I never disrespect you, darlin', uh
I beg you pardon me, darlin'
I see you roamin', ridin'
Yeah, I see right through your body
She say I'm the youngest, but I treat her the nicest
She tryna take it all off for me
She tryna do it incog with me
She tryna stalk young darlin'
I plan on fuckin' every girl in the world, but I'm takin' it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, mm-mmm
You know I bang for you
Even my main know I got a thing for you
Walked in a aisle, anyday for you
I'll go under maintainin' for you
Jump when you say, like a kangaroo
Cryin' over you, and it ain't nothin' new
We danced drunk, then we hurlin'
She presented a gift with a shit-face
I'm tryna fuck every girl in the place, but I'm takin' it
Easy, easy, breezy, easy
Easy, breezy, easy, breezy
Yeah, look
Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand there's a problem, we don't talk to vice
That's sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin' like no time
They'll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quizno's
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please
I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
So I never really had a chance to escape
Fast forward to '07, ain't nothin' much changed
The D still scope the crip
And the mics ain't really that much bigger than the roaches is
And told the same damn sad story, different publishin'
D boys jugglin', single mother strugglin'
The media try to cover it
But the Cottonelle two-ply in your neighbor's house, I'm on some other shit
Me and Drake from two different walks of life
My left arm's like David Wells
My right arm's like Holliday, so I'm probably lookin' at 8 to 12
For just tossin' one of my close friends a bag of chips
Shit, I know they want me locked up
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
Ayy, elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)
If you need me, you can't call me, I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind, all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy with my business, homie
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne (Haan) when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes
When I was with Ms. Creighton, that lady hates me
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favourites, it feels amazin' (Yeah)
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate
I'm in bed awake, thinkin' how'd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
My mood is changin' this summer, I'ma be tweakin'
Ayy, higher
Ahhhhhhh
You've got me fe–
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
They always ask, "Why let the story run if it's false?"
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then
You've got me fe–
Higher, higher
You've got me fe–
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher
I got a hundred Gs on my line
I ain't eatin' Jacksons when I be in Overtown
Got a odor there in the attic, that's a couple pounds
New Rolex that I ordered, that's a hundred thou'
Time to milk the game, bitch I went and bought a cow
Slid up on him with the stick, yeah and sat him down
My nigga Nut so slick, they ain't pat him down
I got a hundred niggas on my line
A hundred squares at a time, nigga, hold it down
Addicted to money, addicted to chips
My hoe was gay, now she addicted to dick
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm gettin' them stacks, it's more addictive than crack

Connor Shell:
You’re so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of Toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city. Can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision, and that ultimate responsibility?
Drake:
Yeah, I mean, I think that for the last week and a half I’ve probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life he’s in. I don’t think that there’s a better way to deal with it than how he just did. I think if we can give out an award at the ESPYS for incredible essay writing, I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he just did was patriotic in its own way, was courageous and was just, to me, I think it’s going to be one of the most historic things of our generation.
I’m just honored to know him and glad that I’ve gotten to, no pun intended, witness this moment for sure. I think it’s an incredible thing.  I actually woke up kind of late today, so I’m just catching on. It’s a great feeling for me. I can’t wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am because he’s been a friend of mine for a long time.
Shell:
Obviously, you’ve joined Saturday Night Live and we’ve had Justin Timberlake host the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to the ESPYS than what we’ve seen in the past?
Drake:
I think obviously one of the talents that I’m able to bring to the ESPYS is music, but I’m just going to get up there and I want to just prepare a great night for people. I think we have prepared an incredible night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music, but I’m not there to put on a strictly music‑based show. Yeah, we definitely have some incredible pre‑tapes. Yeah, I think it’s just going to be a great night overall. I’m there to deliver a great hosting job.
Shell:
What makes the perfect ESPYS host? We’ve seen some amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer?
Drake:
Well, I think what makes a perfect ESPYS host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats. But I think most importantly what I bring is the fact that I feel that I know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys I have personal relationships with. I think I’m going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that I don’t know.
To me, it’s just about knowing the room that you’re in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve.
Shell:
Hosting a sports awards show, what do you feel is music’s role in sports?
Drake:
Well I said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go. I think that when I speak to any of my friends that play sports they’re always super into music, whether it be rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I’ll obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league, so I think they’re synonymous in that way. We inspire each other, and I think that’s what really ties music and sports together.
Shell:
This is a question for the producer, and if possible I have a follow‑up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the decision that was so successful for ESPN, was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the ESPYS? Did anybody reach out? Were you close?
Maura Mandt:
No, there was not an attempt to have that be there. And with the decision, it wasn’t something we were looking to have that announcement be on the ESPYS. Certainly if LeBron wanted to announce on the ESPYS, I would have happily had him there. I think what the ESPYS is about is the sports world plays out over the year, and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective, and that’s what you look for the host for.
Shell:
Drake, in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance, and a lot of times in hip‑hop that’s kind of also a part of rap music and it’s always been. Do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage, whether it be metaphorically or outright in hip‑hop?
Drake:
I think that’s a funny question. I think it’s a good fit. I definitely think that hip‑hop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for. I think we’re not trying to end people’s careers or make people feel bad in any way, and that’s kind of most of the time what problems in hip‑hop are about. So our night, like I said, is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports.
So, yeah, I think there is definitely a difference. Though being clever with words is being clever with words, so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a bit different.
Shell:
Well, I obviously don’t want to give away the material. But I do have a growing affection for Skylar, and I’m not sure she’ll be able to make it, but I’m sure I’ll give you a treat if you enjoy my past references. I’m sure, if I haven’t done it already, now that I know you’re looking for it, I might stick one in there, for sure. You never know.
One of the things about ESPN and the ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build‑up.  Today, I don’t know if you realize this, but you’ve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that Chris Brown posted up. I just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means?
Drake:
Well, as far as the latter end of the question, I’d rather not comment on it, but I know that our goal is obviously the night of the ESPYS to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards. I think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet. That’s why I’m excited.
Is Cleveland your new favorite sports city? How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins, Manziel, and LB James into your ESPY segment?
Drake:
First of all, I’d like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks, I do not team jump. I’ve been ‑‑ in the past, I’ve always supported the player and not the institution unless it’s the Kentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from. But what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer, whether it comes to football or obviously basketball, I have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams.
So it’s not that I’m team jumping, I’m just a supportive friend. With the recent news, of course I’m going to go ‑‑ of course I’m going to go watch games in Cleveland. If not for LeBron, who like I said has been a brother to me for years, I mean, we’ve got three kids from Toronto on one team, plus we have Manziel who, again, is part of our family and like a brother.
So I definitely have to look into some real estate in Cleveland and maybe make some trips this year. I might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best.
But, yeah, like I said, my teams will always forever be who they are, but, yes, I will support the group that has shifted to Cleveland. I think that for Cleveland, a place that I’ve been time and time again touring, I just think it’s going to be greet. I really would love to see that city grow because they’re just a supportive group of people, and it is a great place, so I’m really excited.
Shell:
So the ESPYS is your second host gig this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So is hosting something that you’re trying to do more of or are you just working on more music? You have a lot to write about now that you’re a bachelor again.
Well, actually, my status hasn’t changed, just to clear that up. I’ve always been out here coasting. But aside from that, the ESPYS is my main focus like SNL. When I commit to something, I don’t let my focus stray.
So for Maura to give me this opportunity to host, I don’t take it lightly. I put everything on hold to be ‑‑ to give the best performance that I possibly can at this awards show, and then from there, I have things coming up, whether it’s the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne, which is a real thing, which a lot of people don’t know if it’s a real thing or not, but it’s very real and it’s going to be very competitive. And then from there, I’ll figure out the next steps for me.
I’m always working on new music, but the ESPYS is the main focus right now, and we’ll figure out what’s next afterwards.
Shell:
One thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is you’re a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved the Katt Williams and Lil Wayne.  With having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience, can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show?
Yeah, I’m actually excited to say that I definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance, and that is something that I actually pride in that I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character, especially if I know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms. So, yes, I will be doing impressions during the ESPYS, and they’re good. I’m excited.  They’re great.
Shell:
Are you bringing your lint roller?
Oh, yes. I think I’ll probably have it somewhere around. Maybe I should. I should bring it out on stage. You shouldn’t have said it on the call. You should have anonymously sent that tip in, maybe we would have used the joke. No, I think I’ll be lint‑free that night. I’ll have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit.
So we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning on the same fashion wearing any Calvin Klein suits, and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what they’re going to wear?
I’m not exactly sure what brands I’m going to be wearing. Right now I’m sort of still, like I said, very focused on the show. I’ll figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers I’ll be wearing. But I’m more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that I’ll be draped in for you all to admire. So that’s really what my main focus is, but I’ll get my suits together.
I’m also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself. I might just cut to somebody and I won’t have to say anything.
Shell:
Drake:
Well, I mean, I’ve gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends. You know, one of my mentors who is not an athlete, but obviously Jamie Foxx, a previous host and a big reason why I asked to be a part of this, just because that performance that he gave, I believe he hosted twice or three times, oh, twice, right. It was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music, but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was. So his mentorship and advice has been great to me. Is there anybody that I’m looking forward to meeting?
I mean, yeah, I was going to say, I’ve never met Skylar. I’m sure it will be extremely awkward when I do. But I guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up, which she probably won’t. Her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something. But, yeah, if I ever get to meet her I probably owe her an apology right off the bat. It’s been all in good spirits. But, yeah, that is the one person I’d like to meet.
Just for that last person, I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. Yeah, Nick whatever his name is, because he didn’t win, so that’s how he’s going to be remembered. Nick whatever his name is.
Shell:
Can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you, and how many are coming from the writing staff? Also, if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song?
Drake:
Oh, very good double question. Well, for the first part, the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible. We have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady Maura all the way down to the writers and everybody that’s involved. Everyone involved has been incredible to work with. We’ve been at it now for three months, I think, just on and off, meeting and talking and brain storming. As far as ideas being mine, I am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that I submitted are what I’m going to be performing or delivering on Wednesday night. Whether it be music, jokes and pre‑taped pieces, I was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it.
Is writing a joke harder than writing a song? I think that because of the way I write songs which is very honest, raw emotion about my life, I think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because it’s just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding Drake song as the public would deem it.
But, yeah, I mean, all my music is so honest, that sometimes it’s hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself. When you’re able to be lighthearted and joke around, I enjoy it. It comes a little quicker than songs do.
Mandt:
I’d like to make a comment on the collaboration process. Having worked on the show a number of years, one of the things that really resonates in the content is when it’s authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have the access we’ve had to Drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on what’s coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life, it really elevates it, so it’s definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved.
We had a shoot the other day from one of the skits, and on set he was coming up with stuff, and you guys will see it and know what I’m talking about when you see the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It was really like an improv session, and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see. I’m really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show.
Like real music doesn't always win Grammy's
But we're okay...
Honorable mention works for me and you
Honorable mention, hey, hey
You're lucky that LeBron finally had to lose
Yeah, season's over, just hold on you're going home
Can't deal with life's hurdles like you're Lolo Jones
You ready
Iggy Azalea and Swaggy P
You know what I'm saying?
Collin Kaepernick you know I love to see you flexing
It's just a damn shame that Michael Crabtree can't catch it
Danica you don't always come in first place we know
But somehow in Nascar you're the only face we know
Honorable mention
Honorable mention
Didn't win didn't lose
And now the whole the whole U.S of A are soccer fans too
They get an honorable mention
But even in Brazil inspirational dreams don't always
Come true
Yeah
Yeah
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
I'm with girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public
Young nigga from the city
Yeah, gotta love it
*Laughs*
Yeah
Damn V-O, sounds like you got a lot of niggas mad at you bruh. Guess that's what happens when uh, you a R&B Diva tryna live a rapper's life. You know what I'm saying. But um, if you really want it with me man I got you, I'mma show you what it is to get exposed, I hope I'm on key, hahaha
The V-O-Y I'm talking to you

Furthest thing from street bruh, that's why I call you sidewalk
How you gon' knock me out lookin' like Snoop on a diet?
Uh, listen slim fast, we all know that
The only time that you raisin' up the shooters is in the gym class
This ain't dooms day, this today and after
This a diss track from your sister's favorite rapper
Oh man... Yo V-O man let's reminisce for a second man, we been through a lot of shit man. Like um, you remember when, you remember when you used to kick it at Jazzy's studio yo? And you used to make fun of Rahmel and say that he looked so old that if you punched him in the face, his head might turn to dust yo. I remember that, and you used to make of Diggs too man and now you like, standing side by side with him cuttin' records, I think that shit funny man. Ayo Boi-1da you remember the time he told us about um, knockin' some dude out back in uh, what was it college, university man, but really, he got his ass laid out and had to call D10 to come fix him up [laughs]. Oh man. let's get back into the track
Ho, I hope this ego trip you on won't last honey
Cause everyone you get around got you gas money
We all had to give you lifts, isn't that funny?
It's real talk, you know better I don't play that
But this the same nigga that be talkin' about a Maybach
And can't make a move from his momma house in Ajax
Dawg, I mean, you just shit on everybody, b. And that's ya problem man, I'm about loyalty man. I mean, I remember when you told me that D10 better pull his act together or else he gon' be babysittin' ya kids man, damn! You done shit on Sho, Me, Symphony, Andreena, Carmen, Lanny, Jazzy, Promise. Man, you done made fun of everybody over at Maxamus Melanie, Taj, Rahmel, Diggs. You said you was gonna knock ex out. You even made fun of Boi-1da when I wasn't around. I mean dog, you, you just a unloyal cat man (It's what it is) and this the commitment right here, Heartfelt music, ho! Ya man Toronto I got you for the next two summers don't even worry man. Yeah, shout out to everybody I know, everybody that's down with me that know that they down with me man. Precise waddup, Jason Johnson waddup, Niko waddup, Janyelle I see you baby and I know you seeing Niko, hahah

Do that dance. Do that Dance
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car
Instead these girls taking it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame
You special girl, don't leave me baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry depict
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure
I tell it all to her
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's like and can't be all sure
Because really, What is a window without a car door?
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did
So, I'mma change, yeah this Summer is grown
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back
You special girl, don't leave me baby
To find another just like you won't be easy baby
So, at least I know where the ones at
Baby just promise me if you go that you'll come back

Something spinnin' fast either me or it's the room
I bet you it's the room, cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin I'd advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't Christian
It's that motherfuckin' heat you can find up in the kitchen
Baby holla at your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
We all of age and I ain't got nothin' to hide y'all
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin' me I'm the one and I haven't even made it
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
I just set the 40 ups, and I got two blunts
I’m sipping on lean, while you got fruit punch
Getting faded like clothes, I’ve been washed too much
Man, smoking with the devil got me high as an angel
Blow a smoke ring over my head, it’s a halo
Wake up, and bake up, spend the whole day slow
Head in the clouds, but my face low
Ayo, I got them percocets, you want a percocet?
I purchase cess ‘cause everyday I work with stress
High while I’m driving, it’s like I’m triyn’ to work a jet
And I smoke like a choo-choo train
So I stay low-key like Ja Rule new name
And I can barely walk, but it’s all good and dandy
Man, I’m so high I need a pilot to land me
Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
Maybe I'm hearing things cause I'm feeling like I'm faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
F-faded f-faded
I'm feelin' like I'm faded faded f-faded f-faded faded f-faded f-faded faded
You expensive, you know that?
I'm high maintenance a little bit but not in a
Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games
'Cause they feel like they know me (they know me)
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed (I done changed)
This ain't no motherfucking 91
I don't fuck with nobody in this shit but Bun
You would think it's all mine the way I took it (Yeah)
You would think it broke down the way I push it (Yeah)
You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't? (Yeah)
Working, working, working, working, ain't ya?

Part 1: Faithful
Check, 1-2, 1-2, bitch

Not in a negative way

Foot off in their ass is what Ken told me
Niggas like to play games cause they feel like they know me (they know me)
You don't know me, nigga, I done changed (I done changed)
So don't be trying to be putting on shit off in the game (game)

You're coming over
I wet all the floors of your ego
Feel like I was slipping away
And you know that I ain't gonna go, ain't gonna go nowhere, nowhere
Cause some of these things never change, no, no
There's a lot on my mind and you bother the times that I matter with you
But we keep it way more way more than, way more than 100, we keep it 110
Show me what I gotta do

Tonight I'll make sure (you cum before me)
And before you leave here (I need you to cum)
It ain't about me no more (need you to know)
Make that sure you (cum before me)
Part 2: Make Sure
Get you on top of me
We can do this still properly
Get your hands in the air, do your hair back
You're like a winning ticket off the lottery
Yeah, you don't want to start with me
But you should, keep shaking that in front of me
Unless you're down to do this publicly
You know, you know you gon' get comfortable
On the [?] rug with me
And I fuck with you
So if you really fuck with me
Get as freaky as you wanna be, girl it's up to you
And she hit me with that "I don't do this normally, but for you I'll make exceptions"
Let's see what's next then
And it makes so much sense now (I need you to cum)
Girl it makes so much sense now (told you to leave)
You know that I'm gon' make sure now (need you to know)
Make sure, make sure  (cum before me)
Make sure, make sure (told you to leave)
You know I gotta make sure, gotta make sure (need you to know)
Make sure, make sure  (cum before me)
I got fake people showin' fake love to me

Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Somethin' ain't right when we talkin'
Look like you hidin' your problems

You won't never get to run me
Just when shit look out of reach

Like one, three, yeah
That's when they smile in my face
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Yeah, I know they wanna take my place

Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
I've been down so long, it look like up to me

Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
Whole time they wanna take my place
I can tell that love is fake (I can tell that love is fake)
I don't trust a word you say (I don't trust a word)

Look you in the face, and it's just not the same
I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me

I've been down so long, it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin' fake love to me
Straight up to my face, straight up to my face
Skrrt
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Yeah, it's Drake, KC
Just smiling and talking
Then add to my surprise
Got lost in your eyes
This time they were different
And I found what it meant
After I leaned in I helplessly fell in
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
I think that I'm in love
In love and I can't see
What's happening to me
You blinded my thoughts
From what pain and tears taught
See my hearts been broken before
It don't trust love anymore
One kiss from you
I just felt myself fall right through
Help me I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where I think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Not even I could have helped myself from falling
I got butterflies, can't control myself
Close my eyes at night and I dream of you
It's true, don't know what to do
Don't stop now
Since I let you in
You showed me how
You showed me how to love again
And there's no reason why
I can't give you a try (you know what it is)
'Cause it feels so right
Was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some considerable degree
Steppin' out the house
We would never be together, is what they told us
From immature kids to entrepreneur kids
We bought our own dreams instead of the ones they sold us
Keep it a hundred, what they sayin' I'm a liar for?
Airing laundry, that's what I got a dryer for
What are they even searching through attire for?
Callin' them out is red rover to me
To them it's a dream, its just a rare rover to me
See I'm passionate and focused
I don't know how they expect a Scorpio born in October to be, but ugh
I'm going in, check
Look, previously mischievous behavior was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house
Tryin' to figure out where cameras from cheaters would be
But now, I need a culprit
I am talking all day shopping sprees at the mall with, friends that I ball with, here meet T's girl, go and get some fall shit
Sweetie I am a tracks demise. I will kill this song until it actually dies
With a military jacket and some pack supplies
I won't say I'm the best until the stats arrive
And all these A-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside, its only slacks and ties
But you dont ever act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy until the plaques arrives
I've fallen please help me
Cause you know there's something missing
Not suppose to make you different all the time
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making a mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type (yeah oh uh oh)
I believe in people like you
Cause who am I to judge you on the past girl
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before
Uh look, dress hanging off your shoulder barely sober
And you dance, dance all high, like ballet and shit
Girl I’m wit' it
I’ve been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn
I wonder why I never learn my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and it’s the first impression
Cause man it’s been a while and I swear that this one's different
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been
And I’m slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I’m just trying to correct it, and I fall
Go, go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
Go, go, go, go, go, go 'head
Go, go, go, go, go, go 'head
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Uh, you getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together, uh
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did ('Sup, girl)
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Well, aren't you a breath of fresh air?
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appear
Now she play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
Naked ring finger, M3 Bimmer
Champagne Range, triple-white Jag
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling and bowls of baked ziti
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands (Yeah)
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends (Come on)
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends (Come on)
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends (Come on)
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends (Yeah)
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done, hair done—nails done, hair done
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go
Go, go, go, go, go (As we proceed)
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You—you fancy huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? (Fancy)
Finally back in Toronto, it's better here
I just wanna be anywhere but everywhere
I'm being lazy at the crib kushin' it up
I get enough exercise just pushing my luck
Sitting back thinking damn where did they go
And now I see em picking up the pieces
I guess it’s back to me like it always was
Me and the OVO set like it always was
A little money on the counter I left for my girl
With a note I’m trying to see the rest of the world
It all looked so amazing when we were growing up
Used to sit back and say I know I’ll get a model one day
But all the money and the rap game slow as fuck
And all the models from the hood, Project Runway
Yeah, it’s whatever
You know
Feeling good
Living better
But it’s evident that nothing can prepare us for certain moments that you just gotta cherish
Like this young girl had my lyrics tatted on her arm last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And ended up losing everything that I came with, yeah
Yeah, I still got ten years to go, huh?
This is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
Lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!
Coastline [?]
Plots that don’t twist
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Nails done, hair done, every thing big
Nails done, hair done, everything big
You gettin' ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you’re the fuckin' coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
She got it all together
She dont need to help none
She dont need you to taker her
For some Gucci, huh
For some Louis huh
She got the best of everything
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
And when I find it is when I find you
Better late than never but never late is better
I’m down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it
This is why I do this shit
I think they call this "venting"
Look, this is me, still the same
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)
I never cried when Pac died
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
And I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
It's funny how money can change everything
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Instead of the other way
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Yeah, I never really talk about dick that I wanna give you
Or places I wanna get to
Neck grab, hair grab
Arch back, heart attack, cardiac
I need it nasty like, like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty like how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kai's kitchen
That pussy kinda sound like waves hittin' (Kshh!)
Soothin', keep it right there, no movin'
Make my way around the bases-es
Bein' honest, I don't really know what patience is
Zombie revival, this ain't like you
This that new you, this ain't high school (High)
I like best when you're fresh faced and no foundation
Willin' and ready for the takin'
Earth-shatterin', groundbreakin'
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
And the mascara tears to run down
I always need a glass of wine by sundown
I hope that the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we’re one now
Did somebody…
Who'd they say that baby look like?
Drake!
Cashed out, my neck is frozen
Careful when we're mixin' potion
To deal with you the way you like
To deal with you the way you like
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
Careful when we're mixin' potion
You got options, but I been chosen
To deal with you the way you like
I'm more than just an option (Hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (Hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart (Hey, hey, hey)
And I feel it taking over
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I'm more than just a number (Hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you'll find another (Hey, hey, hey)
So every single summer (Hey, hey, hey)
I'll be the one that you'll remember and—
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
You hear, but you don't listen (Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (Hey, hey, hey)
And get what you've been missing
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
I better find your loving
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I can't do suit and tie
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright
All the time, all the time, all the–
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time (Yeah)
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind
You and your sister
Things would get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind
Dedicate, I dedicate the world
Yeah, oh
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate, oh yeah
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna ride, fulfill all your desires
(Yeah)
I don't wanna fight it
Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
But I don't really buy it
Me? I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
'Cause we never decided, tell me how you feel inside
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it
Yeah-yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
You say, "A guarantee"
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive
But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate to you
This song's for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song's for you
Yeah
I been waiting on this one Charlie, for real
I've been waitin' Driz
I've been waitin', let's get 'em bro
Nah, for real
Shout out Boi-1da too
Mm, I like that
Let's get 'em Driz
You don't have a drink, you're not drinking or what?
I got a drink bro
Hahahaha, I like that
I got my drink right here. Cheers my bro
Toast up man
Yeah, okay, yeah
Goldman Sachs, they wanna hold my racks
Hedge fund investors talk to Adel like he the expert
I hear it in they tone when they address him
We way too connected
Tom Ford assistant texted asking if I want classic or double breasted
I flex with broad shoulders
When I walk through the halls they move over
Stories of how we handle ours start to travel like a lone soldier
I told you
You hold your girl the same way that I hold composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover
Silverstein dinners, all kosher
Never rushin'
Dodge sentences like they don't wanna discuss it, change subject
Got the Benny Yang chains rubbin', never tucked in
Waiting to inhale
Things that I own will sell at auction as proof we did well
My house museum-scale
The only skeletons here are the ones from the nights I raised hell
Make 'em think twice 'bout the stories that they tell
I'ma let 'em walk on eggshells
Wow, man like Drizzy Drake!
Yeah
Got his foot on your neck man
What time is it? What time is it? It's like two in the morning right now
It's me and Charlie, that's it, you hear me? We got the whole building to ourselves
We got the building. Kill them again, kill them again Driz, kill them!
Y'all keepin' the score while watchin' me score
Y'all keep the awards, I'll take the rewards
If y'all goin' for fun, I'll stay and record
I'm living next to Michael, Bobby, Ralph, Johnny
My neighbors soundin' like New Edition
That's these guys
Us guys don't wear New Balance or Levi's
Grippin' the Callaway club in my hand
Hittin' balls off of the balcony into the sand
Tryna see where they land
El chico, this verse is the explanation for the large ego
100 mill' hands free like Ronaldinho
I go from Star to Venetian in a small speedboat with girls we know
Take your pick, Brooke or Tanya
Both those shorties'd leave their GPS on so I can find ya
Drop location
Spring break trips, I'm in hot rotation
Drizzy Drake! You're an animal Drake! You already know that you an animal bruh! Animal!
I'm saucy!
Showed up for you, you know what I'm sayin'?
My brother Drizzy
Wow. And you know what it's like. You stepped out the club into the booth to prove to everyone why you number one bro. Why you got your foot on their necks!
Ayy bro, it feels like that's another moment there, you know what? Like, I got to say this to you on the real bro. The way that you've embraced British culture will be remembered forever. And the UK love you. The real G's over here, you know that bro. When you go to your parties, you see who's in your parties
It's the certies
Nah, listen, but listen. It's a family and it's a big family, you know what it is. I'm just happy to be home, like I said man
My brother, man. Foot on neck time
Yo, are these guys dumb? You see the big man Charlie too, oh my goodness
My brother Drizzy. I can hear these rappers' prayers man
Nah, I'm heated for you right now
They're like, "Yo, please tell Drizzy to take his foot off my neck!"
Nah, I'm heated right now man, oh my goodness. Shout out French Montana, my brother, you know what I'm sayin'? The big wave, yeah. Shout out Huncho, Quavo. Shout out Offset, blessings on the new ting. Oh my goodness. Shout out, yo–. I could go for hours. Charlie, come on man
Ayy, you could go for hours. I was at your party the other night, I've seen who was there. I'm like, "Woah!" There's a lot of people, there was a lot of faces in that party
Yeah, jhee!
And I'll be back January-February part two, you know what time it is. Come on!
Okay, okay
Shout out all the G's too, man. Shout out all the artists man. Everybody from here doin' their thing. I'm telling you. Big inspiration. London, England, come on man
Come on! You know I've applied for your passport, right?
Hahaha. I need that
Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Yeah and my dreams are who I'm racing with
But you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own but it's looking like July 4
This time I'm really going off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me
Who could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
What happened between us that night? It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden, these gossip blogs want to cover me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could've been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I've missed them before
But won't miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like—Oh
Everything's the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping
For real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
How many of our parents marriages lasted?
Searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off, fireworks
Oh, today it begins
I keep having the same dream
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night it's fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like—Oh
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
Shit, nigga, this what I does
This is my club, and I'm dirty in the summer, bitch
You ain't know nothin bitch, you better know who you fuckin with
Try to fuck me, I kill you, and who you comin with
No homo, T, I had to go stupid
I'm on the high heals, but I am no Cupid
Hollands Avinue, ridin with the roof gone
On the Mayback, 2 tone, and my rymms are too brown
I'm talkin out of my head, I make a blue eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a Blood, motherfucker, a Blood, motherfucker
Forever like ETC peariods, good, motherfucker
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm so unsigned, it would blow one's mind
There is no holes bard, there is no love lost
So PAY UP, I don't think you will ever find another nigga like me
This young nigga show boat like I'm sellin a yacht
Who else tryna smoke, me too
Cause take my mind off the Pressure, that's what Weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a Ski-do
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down, hoe, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm going in, like a life sentence
And understand, I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, coppy that, 10 4
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
Kidd Kidd!
You say I'm throghed off, I stay on pitch
Since you ain't fly, throgh you off the roof, fly
Like Pooky, take a Dooky on a rap producer, throgh the trash out the window like Lukey
To a shark, you just Sooshy
You ain't hard, you cucci
Wally, Oochi, so this newborn booty
I say I'm movin slow, I'm just thinkin fast
Look back, I ain't behind you, about to lap your ass
And I'm gonna rest up, till my times up
I be the tech chef, all my beef prime cut
This ain't chorus lines, nigga, your choruses lyon
Cause the only point you ever gained, was a one
But understand, nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever, man—ever, man—ever, man
Too rich for who? Y'all just got rich again
Who grips the mic and likes to kill they friends?
I've never been the type to make amends
If shit was at a eight, we like to, we like to, we like to—
Yeah, if shit was at a eight, we like to make it ten
I don't like to talk when there's nothin' else left to say (True)
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your sister is pressin' play, your trainer is pressin' play
Your wifey, your wifey, your wifey, your wifey— (True)
I gotta breathe real deep when I catch an attitude
I got a whole 'nother level that I can tap into
Max said they only blessed when they attached to you
The only deadbeats is whatever beats I been rappin' to (True)
And the product is still the best though
It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate man, I had to Copperfield like presto
Voilà, tada (True)
Never a matter of "could I?" or "should I?"
Kiss my son on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—
Miss makin' 'em pay
Helipad from Will Smith crib straight to the stage
Three Forum shows but I played Staples today
The neighborhood is smokey, y'all stay safe in this place (True)
Drizzy 'bout to drop, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you hear me out but we both know end of the day
Your niggas is pressin' play, your nanny is pressin' play
Had to go and hit reset, now we here
I been on top for three sets of three years
I can't fly if I could sit on the wing of that shit (True)
I try to pay it less mind
They been keepin' tabs on me like I'm payin' next time
I think I sense a little fear from the other side
White vans parked across the street, real subtle guys (True)
Yeah, never a matter of "could I?" or "should I?"
Kiss my mom on the forehead then kiss your ass goodbye
As luck would have it, I've settled into my role as the good guy
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, no sixes, rest easy, get some shut eye
Hold on, hold up, but I—
Hahaha, I can't argue with you, no! You mad!
Look at you, you mad! You big mad! Haheheh
I'm happy! Leave me alone!
I just want some money, a lot of money
I don't get paid to argue with you
No! Who is you? You ain't nobody!
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me: Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Who'd a thought a country wide tour be the outcome
Everybody gotta deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
Now super bad chicks givin' me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
Like they was down with the old me, no you fuckin' wasn't
Um, you're such a fuckin' loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques, just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out, and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
Okay, hello it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm runnin' from the cops
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
I want this shit forever man
There they go, packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Fuck no! Go for broke, this cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
Back into the game and they know, rap will never be same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains who stand inside of a booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings come flyin' up outta of our mouths
Now rewind it
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinking of saving face
So Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
I want this shit forever man
Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain?
You'll see new heights you’ll be reaching
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Dom Rosé toast
Hidden Hills where I post
I start my day slow
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, "Poor me"
Where you at? I never see you
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Niggas moves so waste
Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It’s bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
And seein' all of you die
And I seen a lot of you die
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Hidden Hills where I post, yeah
'Ye already know, yeah
Far as troublemakin' goes, yeah
House party up the road, yeah

Ya dun know, eh?
More life
Tat my name on you, girl, so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
Tell a bad bitch "Girl, let's go hang"
You know me, Rolex, gold chain
Fuck with my young niggas, XO Gang
Get so drunk you forget your name
Incense burning, smoking out to my own shit
Got black wood in my white Range
I'm taking off when that light change
I'm Drizzy Drake to my old bitches
Voodoo Child to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back so I'm all in with these new flows
New flows, got new flows, rap is stress but it pays great
Pimp flows and Screw flows, my shit is sounding like grey tapes
Now, let me gon' hit that cup, one time 'fore a nigga hit that road
These days keep going by too fast, so give me anything to make shit go slow
Yeah, money in my safe but I'm living dangerous
They told me shit would change but I don't really see no change in us, oh, no
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
'Cause when I'm not around, I still be there in spirit
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
What's up?
I play with her mind, she masturbate in my Porsche
It's simple love, simple math
Her chest nice, not a wrinkle in her ass
Puffing purple hash, welcome to my power circle
Sucker-free, no snitching and we know when cowards working
Rolls Royce rolling, rose-gold Rollies
My momma still praying for her Rubberband Man
I love a bitch that know how to keep me one rolled
Tat my fuckin' name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I ain't tryna hear it
You'll still be mine, yeah, you'll still be mine
Tat my fuckin' name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah, I'll still be yours
Tat my fuckin' name on you, let 'em know you love the boy
What's up?
I don't have to work in the morning so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I'm telling you there's no side-effects, I'm sure
Went from driving up in some old shit to drivers opening doors
Yeah, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
You'll meet everybody I know, at first it might seem like a lot
But they all playing they role, put that on everything that I got
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I done heard things about y'all that they can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I just give everybody a piece of this and make do with what's left
Yeah, I told you it's our world, you foolish thinking I'm wrong, ooh

Uhh, focus on women then you get less done
It's light work, flow is heavy like a wet sponge
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think being broke is less fun
Celebratin' Father's day every day so don't get sonned
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady
I'm chillin' out with T and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it, you say something about it, I doubt it
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it
"Bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch!"
Pardon me, that was rude
If you just started balling I say I'm 'bout to conclude
What more is there to do
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND' (damn)

And I'm callin' your bluff
Don't act like you can't see my dialin'
Never embellish, believe 'em 'cause he ain't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asist
Never been a believer that previously exist
I wonder what I be doin' when previously is this
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your old man?
I tend to dro puff

What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love
"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here eh?
Y'all need to know yourself."
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love
Shoulda spent more nights
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda, coulda, wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin' my time
'Cause she heard it all
'Cause she heard it all
But you heard it all
Well I'ma say it anyway
Shawty, I'm from the city
You ain't gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, I'm just tryna say
I'm from the city, oh
But it never made us different, oh
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
You might feel like nothin' was the same
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
You know that paper my passion
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Uh, this the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before
Yeah yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to
Digital camera, freeze the moments
Use money and talent as my lead component
Normally Drake sip Don P but
You the type of girl that I need Patron with
We could do it, corporate sponsor
Your man prolly riding in his boy's Elantra
You could drop him, he's forgotten, you got options
And plus I show these young boys how to bring the money on in
When they rhymes ain't hot, and they records don't sell
Stuntin' on the strip, came with no I.D
And I only brought cash, if they checkin' oh well
I'm good, Drake make one phone call and I'm inside
Welcome to the life of an icon
And I don't like jewels, but I am thinkin' of you
So
For you to back it up, go on and put ya weight on it
Cause it's alright, do what you wanna
Make me believe ya

Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin

This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis
Nebby Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness.. Drizzy!
Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone
Homie scared. Cause they just like me

And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street

Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery
Dj Drama: See I told ya'll it'd be well worth the wait right?
Wayne: Dedication threeee
Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas "Get it how you can"
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side
I said I am....
Yeahhh
I'mma start this off like you would do it
Shout out to DJ Wristpect
October's Own!
Drizzy!
Hehe
Here I go!
Uhh
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
But, ask Apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
If I was in a room and someone yelled, "Hey bitches!"
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description
But that's just me though
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of O.V.O
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Should I hold back on addressing the lame
Because they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And ever since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he balled like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it
And all you talking ass niggas get over it
And all you people that be hating get over it
And yea I'm turning 22 get over it
You know you got to hear my records get over it
I got the city on my back get over it
Get over it, get over it
DJ Wrispect
Little Brother
Big doe I see you homie
I'm serious man, please, just get over it
Just for y'all I'mma keep it humble as a mumble in the jungle
Y'know what I'm talkin' bout
It's Drizzy
Just lemme live man
Here I go
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Say my name
If no one is around you
Yeah, uh
Say my name, say my name
'Cause those other men are practice
And this ain't no time for actin'
And this ain't no time for games
And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
This is not four years ago
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, "Get money and fuck these hoes"
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
Say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you
Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
But you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
I give it to you, and you take it the best
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
(You gon' like that)
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya
Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Henessy
Straight with no cubes
Take me where the women be
Drake take Patrón to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? they call me the game mind
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena
I'll be Gilbert Arenas
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
And when I give ya what I give ya
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
You better watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-i-ive
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-i-ize
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y
We so certified, we so certifi-i-ied
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I
They gon' bang this here all summerti-i-ime
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
Yeah, yeah
Turn me way up, my voice is really low
(Watch out) Watch out
Why, nigga? (The cops out) Cops out

Started from the bottom, now we here now
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
We about to get the whole nine
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow
I just take the dreams I've been sold
And sell 'em for more, you already know
'Cause I be drivin' round this bih with no sunroof
Man, the glow got me feelin' like I'm gunproof
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin' the time to clear my mind
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go
Watch out for me, I'm bound to glow
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We love y'all too!
We believe if there's anything y'all wanna do in life
Can I hear right on?
Blessed are the children
We live for it
Come on, y'all

Clap your hands this evening
Come on, y'all
And they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yeah
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes, I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
God's plan, God's plan
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ayy, don't
I finessed down Weston Road, ayy, 'nessed
Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, yeah, wait
I make sure that north-side eat
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
Yeah, ayy, ayy
She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly
I only love my bed and my mama, I'm sorry"
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
'Magine if I never met the broskies
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own, ayy, no, ayy
Someone watchin' this shit close, yep, close
I've been me since Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy
Might go down as G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, ayy, wait
I make sure that north-side eat, yeah
And still, bad things
It's a lot of bad things

They wishin' on me, yeah, yeah
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yeah
They wishing, they wishing, they wishing on me
(Yeah)
Ooh, I wish you
This is our downfall
Yeah, I swear they wishing on me

Ready for the downfall

Bad things
There's a lot of bad things
That they wishin'
They wishin'
(Wishin' on me)
Wishing on me
She said, 'Do you love me?"
I tell her "Only partly,"
50 dubs, I even got tatted on me
81 they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the 02 to the 03 dog
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never left the broskies
God's plan, God's plan
(Yah-ah)
Yeah, they wishin'
Oh yeah!
And blow the fee from my last 4 shows
I do one song and use four flows
She use to be a Christian before
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like baby those are cute I adore those
Me & the salesman build a rapport so
He understands the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash only, transactions homie
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
I been doin this for years homie, thoroughly I thought it
But too late now, it too legitimate to hit 'em with
Lawsuits even if those are acts that I did commit
I gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A real Menschkeit as they say he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present every regal member
The coalition, is so efficient
You have to be invited or there's no admission
We know tradition
We spend money so don't try to compete if you're in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
Use to record in the basement that rennie grew his piff in
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen 'til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team playin', no screen settin'
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'
The take over, the break's over, nigga
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshittin' but I'm equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality's so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased is sound vacant
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
I treat this one session as if it was my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life
I guess this is goodbye, Goodnight and Goodluck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elevated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo', converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight bi
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh
I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, nigga
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Summer's mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times, I'ma need it back
Wish that you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you
I'm spendin' time just taking care of me right now
I'm gettin' money just taking care of me, girl
But the good ones go
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
You should go, before you stay too long
But don't you go getting married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
Can't lose you, can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chillin' in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's sounding so H-Town
But when it's all done, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh
But the good ones go
The good ones go, if you wait too long
The good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go
You should go, before you stay too long
Make me hate where I'm from, you as fake as they come
Everybody got guns, who the fuck gonna squeeze
Everybody got SARS, you ain't fucking with these
Why you wish to be ghetto, tell me what's it about
Why you tryna get in where I'm tryna get out
Why won't you just be yourself, why won't you tell us the truth
Like how you only load guns when you up in the booth
You just a fantasy, family as weak as it gets
And you ain't speakin' a bitch, cause I don't listen to chicks
I don't argue with broads, cause I'm really a pimp
But I will tell you this, as far as y'all are concerned
Pull out my Santa Claus, and make the holidays burn
You can call me the Grinch, cause y'all are nothing but Who's
Just another bunch of phony acts with nothing to prove
Now let the kids play like the rider's ride
We spendin' all day, these niggas idolize
They claim they want fame nigga so we decided
That we gon' make 'em some stars until the drama dies
But they can go back to they holes where they mama lies
Funny, claim the thug life that they abidin' by
But run up on 'em, then they turn into the silent type, they wanna compromise
And roll with them bitches that got they body right
These niggas ain't built, ain't got the body type
Time to break a nigga's spirit like the Amistad, tryna fool the audience
Feel the ambience
Stars in your presence, kings of the city are appalled by the peasants
Ain't gotta say names, we can all get a reference
Brains and the info from your broads in the west end
Masters, flowing staggers on bars
Nigga stay mad cause his swagger's on Mars
Y'all niggas ain't thinking we calling y'all 'tards
Claim you want war, okay, on guard
Ayo, hey you Mr. Rapper Guy
When you in the booth, tell me why you have to lie
Come on, spit the truth, all I hear is bang bang, hustle this, hustle that
But if you hustle crack, then where the money at?
No proof, Dr. Seuss, story tellin' when he rhyme, like
Once upon a time I was really on the grind
There's another lie, couldn't out-hustle me
I'm only goin' at generic rap niggas that
Rap about ki's but couldn't show me 10 G's
And these nigga' dry snitching on they tees
Standing out, like a sore thumb to the D's
My nigga please, if you really had work
You would do what you do and wouldn't put it on your shirt
You ain't no hustla, just a nigga that can rap good
See there's a height requirement, nigga to mention my name (smarten up)
How the fuck you little niggas didn't stay in your lane
Man you offered me a truce and I took it
Now I hear this bullshit so how the fuck am I to overlook it?
How the fuck are you a hustla with your factory job ?
And I don't get it, nigga I'm a fucking diabetic
And I don't usually eat y'all sweet niggas
Waddup Roxx? now we cool? then you dip out
I'm saying, we don't believe y'all niggas (nah)
G-35, x5 nah niggas (yeah)
This here is a public announcement for my niggas (yeah)
No more goodnight, good mornin', goodbye niggas
I don't appreciate niggas sayin' my name in they bullshit
It's like putting a knife against the lyrical full-clip
If I was rapping like y'all I woulda killed myself
And nah, this ain't beef, it's missing a few ingredients
Dog you ain't a general, stick to being obedient
Piggy back, that ain't something I had to do
Laughing at Drake? you should'a seen how I was laughing at you
I don't beef over little shit, angry? A little bit
I don't do the little subliminals, I'm addressin' it
And if Littles wanna get in the middle then I'm suggesting it
They called you a bitch, were tryna act out
They challenge 'em to a fight and then they back out
So tell me how the fuck I can respect you cats
If you a gangsta, then what part of the game is that?
How it feel to count dough while you palmin' the heat?
I heard that weak shit and only wanted the beat (it's true)
And fuck the women that's lying to all the guys they met
And fuck the features on my songs and the deals on the table
Or basically it's fuck everything that you strive to get
And it's the room of resolution, I'm finishing it in here
If I copy Budden's flow, you mimickin' his career
And the same money we hearin' you giving to charity
You need to be giving to Littles to give him some clarity (what up Littles)
'Cause that's your homeboy I think he's owed that much
Tell him pressing 25 don't mean you sold that much
And Breana, I don't mean to alarm ya
But you need to get outside the car to shoot this video in Parma (Tony!)
And this is not hatin' my nigga we call it karma
But yo Thug Life, show me where the hammer be
Yes I took an L on my own and they didn't damage me
You try to cover up your lies like a canopy
And tryna pull 17 year olds down in Bramalea (I know about it)
And we don't got it out for you
We just saying that don't nobody vouch for you
Nope, nobody thorough is willing to give a cosign (nobody)
And you don't even sell blow, you just blow time
You can't even get a factor grant
So stop rapping, go fix parts at a tractor plant (damn)
And listen here, Tetley Tea
We all got niggas doing bids "Mr. Wishheart" (what up Cam)
It's not cool to use another nigga's as a threat tho'
I said you a bitch, I heard a seven man echo
You saying I hustle, my source for currency coke
They saying you never moving it and currently broke
And you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime
Just so you can have something to say in you rap lines
Dog if I were you, I tell you what I would do
I would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you
Lose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through
'Cause they the only people recording that wanna hire you (it's true)
With what I spend in a weekend I could acquire you
Some of them believe you got money you little liar you
But, I don't admire you, short niggas tell tall tales
Good riddance Aristo I just retired you!
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
Damn, "I guess it does" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah
Uh, yeah, this what yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF
Thank me later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup
June 15th in this bitch wasup
Noel That’s it Ahhhhhh
You've been home for three whole days
Actin' like you got chores to do
Boy this house is way too clean
I don't think there's nothing more to do
Oh, you don't need that girl, she did it all wrong
You was still you before she ever came along
I mean I understand the pain
Someone did me the same
I just put that nigga in his place then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you wanna know the truth
I think you should just get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order you a drink, don't even overthink
Call a couple friends you know you can have some fun with
And go out tonight, go out tonight
Cause you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for somebody to be with
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me
And I'm lookin' for, and I'm lookin' for
And I'm lookin' for what you're lookin' for
Yeah, you might just meet me
Yeah, yeah
Tell me how you really feel
I would ask you what's the deal
But y'all don't even got a deal
Most niggas with a deal
Y'all a whole lot of things
I don't know no one
That could tell me what to do
Heard the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I pull up in yachts so big
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin', yeah
Just like the old times
Same niggas from the old days
Lotta sides on the same side
OVO, we a gold mine
But I'm goin' gold, no time
Doing plat, plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
Like I'm shirt off, like I'm shirt off
Whole city goin' crazy
Top five, no debatin'
Top five, top five, top five
And the whole city rate me
And I'm back inside The Matrix
And I said that we would make it
We done really put some days in
Hey, why you so excited? You know what I'm sayin'?
What happened?
Did you win the Grammy? God damn
You actin' like you fuckin' won a trophy and shit
This nigga turnt the fuck up
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Swervin' out the Panoramic
I'm hangin' out, they can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm swervin' off, they can't stand me
I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Gonna peel off like a bandit
I'm noddin' off on a Xanax
Get pissed off, start airin' it
Get a head start, ain't friendly
I stand out, I don't blend in
When I say that I meant that
I don't want features from nan them
I don't want features or nothin'
You can't even get on my guest list
They want me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon
That Actavis Hi-Tech it don't matter
We sittin' right on the courtside
I know the players on both side
I'm cashin' out, fuck a cosign
Keep a fo'-five for the po' guys
Black tints, low profile
Celebratin' everyday
'Cause I'm really really fresh out the coke house
Countin' up every single day
'Bout to bring a whole 'nother whip out
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
I'm showin' out, they can't stand me
I'm rr off, can't stand me
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
They gon' think I won a Grammy
Uh, I am a distraction
Comin from my spot and I dont signal as I back in
If cash is beautiful, then money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin’ centerfold of Maxim
Open to my page and admire my desire
Frequent flyer, I aspire to retire
My voice stands alone even if I’m with the choir
Got a cannon on my hip, but nigga, this is not Mariah
Na, this the record killer for hire
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require
Look I created, despite the niggas that hated
Every single bar gettin' first forty-eighted
The me and bitch the same, we feel so related
I put a thousand on it, I could probably fuck the waitress
So, wait, just take this
Oone lie at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit
Drop a four in it and then appreciate The Greatness, nigga
I wrote this verse sittin' in my new car
Sometimes where you headed is too far
It’s more about where you are
Somebody, somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
But understand rich is how we're all ending up
I’m at the label in the elevator, send 'em up!
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga
Yeah, October Firm in the cut
She wanna get married tonight
Me and my broski are twins, but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax
That and the spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack
Virginia Black
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts?
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my, word to my—
Who's not gang, bitch? Let me find out
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Gotta do Maybach, she wanna fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
Hermès link, ice-blue mink
Bury me now and I only get bigger
That's word to my nigga
She says, "Kiss me like you miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
Just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It’s all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don’t I?
I get off topic, don’t I? I get it poppin’, don’t I?
You’ll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out
While shoppin' with a nigga, don’t lie
She’s losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You know how it goes: don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo' shit, I put you back in your place
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make
I think she's choosing it right now
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she’s here and we're both so gone
Oh, oh-oh
Oh
Oh, oh, oh
Overdosed on confidence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
That's just something they know
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
They know, they know, they know
Yeah!
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, "They miss the old Drake", girl don't tempt me
"If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do"
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
I be yelling out "Money over everything!"
"Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!"
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah…
I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or what will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and struggle, and it takin' forever
About hearts that you've broken, and ties that you've severed
No doubt in my mind, that'll make them feel better
It's ya boy, DJ Motherfuckin IllWill
You know I had to team up with my man DJ Rampage for this shit right here
My man, Drake, AKA Heartbreak Drake, AKA Interscope's brand new franchise player
Torronto, stand the fuck up
Heartbreak Drake, let's go!
All the school kids are so sick of books and learnin'
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers that I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hangin' out at the doughnut shops
The ice is meltin' as if the world is endin'
She asked me
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
"Who are you gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?"
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
I ain't even got a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
What are we even doing?
Ridin' clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinkin' dirty things
I've seen some things
I wish we had met when I was in my teens
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord
'Cause these days I only know conditional love
I'm too used to switchin' it up, oh
And she says, "You don't how good it is to be you 'cause you're him"
Then ask myself
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
Who am I gonna be when it's all over? When it's all over?
I don't wanna think about that right now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
Can't think straight in the heat of the moment, heat of the moment
Yeah, you're right. You're right. Alright man, well, shit, I just wanted…
They know they're too hot. They don't give a fuck. It's the heat of the moment. It's the heat of the moment and that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment.  
I agree
This shit, that's all it is. It's the heat of the moment. Be a 100% woman, or try and be a 100% man, and use a fucking condom
I got my eyes on you
You're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
Just hold on, we're going home
I got my eyes on you
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you
You left your mark on me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
I think there's something, baby
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something, baby
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
'Cause you're a good girl and you know it
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on, we're going home (going home)
Young Money till the young boy dyin' out
You hear me cryin' out
You see me ridin’ out
We’ll buy 'em out
Cause we be livin’ what these other rappers lyin' bout
Drizzy Drake, what
Funk Flex, uhh
Hot 9-7, I’m so far gone
Feelin' good, feelin' great, how you though?
Sippin’ on pink shit, but nah it ain't Nuvo
Slow the F down 'fore yo ass is on Pluto
My city love me, but I got Toronto haters too
That sit around and talk about
What they’d have done if they was you
But know I ball without a sphere in sight
And just know thatIbe in the mirror like
Are you listenin’? I hope you hearin' right
I’m in the Aston doin' doughnuts
New York City, I can tell the people want it
Uhh, what you got for me flex, uh
Vacuum interiors and shined wheels
What's ya life like? This how mine feels
I like my seat back, I like my wine chill
I look good, smell better, and I rhyme ill
I say I’m at these girls neck and head
You and your girl sleep in separate beds
I killed this, tell Flex it's dead
You got birthday cake, mines weddin' tall
I get the girl of your dreams and I never call
NY, I got it, I'm bout whatever y'all
I’m at your girls condo gettin' shown around
Yeah, why you takin' everything personal?
This that in-ya-face, all-offensive-on-purpose flow
My city, never F’n need me
Yeah, oh wait no they really need me
Holla at me when you done F’n Weezy
Ho, yeah, uh huh
Ahahaha, the boys of summer are here man
Ayo Trey, I got something mean for this one boy
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Guess not
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
Somebody get the waiter
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
Ridin' low
Layed back in the seat when I creep
That's just how I roll
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough
Cause it ain't all about that no more
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be
Yo I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury
But without it all I'm still about the game
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no
Because the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)
It ain't about the rims on my truck
Ain't about the ice on my watch
Ain't about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It ain't about the shoes that I've got
Ain't about my dough or my rocks
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop
You used to, you used to
Yeah
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
Ever since I left the city…
Hey there, pretty girl
And I don't blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the light's so bright
And the money's so right
And it's comin' in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And it go, "Hey now, now, watch her go down"
Oh, oh, oh
She doesn't ever worry
She knows there's more to life
And she's scared of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
And she dance to the song
And it go, "Hey now, now, watch her go down"
Oh, oh
We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin', all-star weekend
Housekeeper knock to see if all y'all decent
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin' right all season
But you always with me on the night y'all leavin'
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, it's prolly 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you, although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think that I'm going crazy
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And she dance to the song
And she dance to the song
And it go, "Hey now, now, watch her go down"
Oh, oh, oh
Crazy how you gotta wait until it's dark out to see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss you
Shit'll come back around and get you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls' numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?
My heart belongs to you...
Yeah, always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain't even say thank you
I had no money left from actin', I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like "who's this?" I be like "me, girl"
You be like "oh, word, true shit?"
Them car rides made me feel like I was losin' it
Yeah, made me feel I ain't have it like that
Started drinkin' way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian, I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year
Places that I should've been
Yeah, you ain't really fuck with me way back then
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now (Stuck right now)
Oh, you thought you had it all figured out back then
Girl, how 'bout now? (Now)
'Cause I'm up right now (I'm up right now)
And you stuck right now, yeah (Stuck right now)
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough, girl
How 'bout now? Yeah
Girl, how 'bout now, how 'bout now, girl?
What about now, girl, how 'bout now?
My heart belongs to you
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Whatever you need, there's nothin' I won't do
Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
There's stories to tell, we been through it all (Damn)
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
Uhh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
They cannot fuck with the legacy
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies

To make sure the money was right

That must be why you move so... icy
Icy like there's nobody you’d ever need
Better not give that up to anyone but me (yeah)
Patient as can be, but
I still need some satisfaction
Feel a rump-rump
Baby, I'm needin' somethin', somethin'

Yeah
Everybody said that you let me down
Hesitation bring the "you" around
Makes no difference what you used to do
I could never
I could never
Maybe you were reckless yesterday
I'm convinced you know a better way, I know it
Some would judge based on what you've been through but
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I, I could never (yeah, yeah)
Harsh truth to my face
I've been told to walk away (just know)
I could never
Things that I would choose to do with you if I had time though
Thousand times I fucked you in my mind, trust me I know
Everybody said that I let you down
And let the truth but I can still be found, yeah
Lost my way and only you were there
Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Could you ever, yeah
Could you ever
Sometimes I ask how you could ever want me
How could you choose that you would ever love me
To be in a stare right back at me
Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah
Could you ever
Could you ever
Could you ever be ashamed of me, yeah
Why can't you ever
*Lyrics from Snippets*
Ayy
It was meant to happen, the most trusted going triple platinum
Link with Mac, link with P if I'm down in Baton (/and battin'?)
Link with Cans link with C, when I'm down in Jackson
This ain't them, this is me so you know what's crackin'
Before I made it out, I said, "I got to make it out"
And I did, I did, I really did
Flippin' cinnamon, grabbin' on instruments
(Uh)
Please put away the cameras
Cause we just in the club getting MC hammered
And God forbid we ever trade our wisdom for the glamor
And I know that I'm just a boy that a woman can make a man of
I just want a woman that looks 30 when she's 81
Please don't give it all away
I hope that you can save me some
The more they pass they heart around the more jaded that they become
But this one's special
So I make sure that my suit'll fit
The one my daddy wore in June of 85
And have her doing all the things she'd only do when she get married
So let's do this shit
Tell the reverend all we're missing is his blessing
So we exchange vows
They clap, we take a bow
And she'll be doing tricks for daddy
When we take it to the house
Haha, haha
Yeah, ayy (After dark)
In the whip solo
No one's gotta know (After dark)
I don't gotta work anymore (After dark)
You can
Put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands (After dark)
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark
Late night like Left Eye, I'm creepin'
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
So, I don't know how serious you take it
That narrative for me isn't changin'
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way (After dark)
In the whip solo, no one's gotta know
(No one's gotta know) after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
(I don't gotta work no more) after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark
Late night, me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in, put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night (Ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, don't wanna get your hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said, "Do anything, but just don't lie to me"
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me
Umm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost
And when it's after dark anything goes
In the whip solo, no one's gotta know
(No one's gotta know) after dark
Knockin' at your door, I don’t gotta work anymore
(I don't gotta work no more) after dark
You can, put your phone down, you’re gonna need two hands
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You can't get enough
Girl, you know I set it up, for after dark

Uh, shit's all good
The deal got signed, and my split's all good
Say that shit in person man, I wish y'all would
I'm a motherfuckin' genius, goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed, then the slightest could have fooled me
Yeah, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname's "Starter Drake"
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen, I could draw attention
But you could tell by my strut
I'm just chillin' in the cut, nigga what, and I'm feelin' like
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
Here I go, street reaper
Ballin' over here, we need three courts
The house looks something like a resort
When this money runs slower than Eeyore
Mister pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now, fuck next up
I get it, I get it, I get it 'til I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimpin' if you plannin' on a visit
And they say that you can talk it when you live it
I'm tryna tell you do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this, but you don't wanna go there homie
Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We should've did this already
Said I got a email today
Kind of thought that you forgot about me
Just like you, I get lonely
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I get lonely too
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
I get lonely
I get lonely
Just like you
Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go
And I'd take probation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-Y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, "Fuck the world with a long dick!"
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
My swagger just screamin', motherfucker, do you hear her?
Woo, Young Mula, baby
Uh-huh
Um, uh-huh
Okay
Hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn'?
On these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenants
And if I said "I'm goin' in" then I motherfuckin' meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'ma motherfuckin' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' wit it
She said "I seen it all", I say "No you fuckin' didn't"
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs", I'm like "Bitch, me neither"
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
Yeah I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
The clock that you've been watching has been stoppin
He makes you wait, what kind of man does that to a girl he wants
If you just give tonight to me I promise my hands will say
They'll say
Less than a minute, take your clothes off
We about to start no false alarms
Even though the traffic downtown don't show no mercy
And I don't only fuck you like that on your birthday
Baby I just landed
And I'm on my way
Don't fall asleep
Yes I see you calling me
Promise it's worth waiting for
Cuz I'm on my way (2x)
Her days are over, baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
I'm ready for ya
Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soakin in your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No options for, you sayin no
Follow my lead, what you waitin fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing

You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya

I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

Mental pictures, no cameras please
I'm in control but with you bein a man
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
You say you wanted fast? Define fast
Cause I could speed it up and make it lastAnd I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
I'm ready, I'm wit it, still here like a statue
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed tooPlus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money 'til the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready too, hope it's somethin that you thought about
Yeah I hear you talkin, don't know who you tryin to flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control but with you bein a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya
Her days are over, baby she's over
I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over. Baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
I'm ready for ya!
Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No option for her, you sayin' no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, whatchu waitin' fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya
I'm in control, but with you bein' a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
Cause it's all part of my plan
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental picture, no cameras please
(Background voice)
Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind
Flash, black lingerie white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass, you say you want it fast
Define fast, cause I can speed it up, and make it last
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure you never forget it, commited, im ready, im with it
Still here like a statue, pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got bagges, well im packed too, plus I got a sex pistol
Im more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about
Artist: Drake
I'm still pullin out the Phantom, and these haters can't stand me
Yeah, I'm still doing my thing
Responsible for everything you listen to, a mediocre tallent, let me see if I can condition you
Took over my city, and I never asked permition to
Started poppin bottles, cause it's ATL tridition to
Celebrate with Bob Ma, fuck him at the So-ho
If there ain't an elevator in it, it's a no go
They just give me head, while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ should've won that
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, halla at me when you're done laps
Roll around with Neego, Party with Azooka
Shout goes out to 1Da, shout goes out to Future
Shout goes out to Getti, motherfucker I am ready
Whoever got the torch, just can't seem to hold it steady
Cause I see the flame flickering, x girls bickering
Got these women jockin me from Holly Grove all the way to Picker Ring
I tryed to send my nigga Short some syrup out in Michigan, but my connect said it'd take a minute if you listening
Please start doing you, I been doing me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruen me
But I got love for everybody, even if you suing me
My brother P-rain know, we fuck with the same hoes
Starin at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hopin on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just halla if you got me, fuck you if you had me
Shout goes out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver, and 40, man, you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to B Plus
And life is good, everything is just fine
I'm still fly, I'm sky high

Yeah, I'm still doing my thing
I'm still fly, I'm sky high
And I dare anybody to try to cut my wings
Yeah, I'm still doing my thing
Yeah
I'm working on dying
I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
I'ma always take the money over sex
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool
I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (Ayy, ayy)
Every month
She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho

Trap, TrapMoneyBenny
This shit got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, yup
BlaqNmilD, you a genius, you diggin' me?
I don't even care, I need a photo with Drake
Because my Instagram is weak as fuck
I'm just being real, my shit, look,–
No love for these bitches I said this year it’s all business
No offence to my nigga, it’s just the industry is small
We all lust for the same women
I know I got a couple things that Lil’ Wayne dipped in
Ain't ashamed to admit it, I be the same with it
This shit is all about hits and misses
Half a mill to perform, I can’t let them fuck that shit up
Plus I love the way my middle name looks when it’s lit up
Jim Moore got me dressing like a leading man
A little favour for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, suits cut right always
New verses crush the hood like I’m driving into something
Bitches on the kid like I’m Iverson of something
Like a Sixer, since I sold 680 in my first
Drizzy Drake, the only one that got the gift without the curse
Swag!
*Lyrics from Snippets*
Trend setter, Ben Frank getter
Whipper dapper, whipper dapper
I buy diamonds when I'm under pressure
Look, I'm in the cut, the boy in the cut
Jump in the whip when the ceilings go up and up
All of this grindin' for what?
It’s funny when you niggas thought it was luck
And I compete with myself while you niggas competin' with trends
I know the truth, no use in pretendin' with him
I'm still in the cut, the boy in the cut
Hop in the whip when the ceilings go up...
Gotta stay up, ain't no knockin' me off
Pull up smooth, we out with the crocs, damn
I'ma dawg (/dog) for real, bitches get Chanel
Thought they got the YSL (You was)
I remember when the feds did this shit, I pray my dawgs didn’t tell
I remember when the feds did this shit, I pray my dawgs didn’t tell
You see the difference between me and you: is that I just hit rock bottom. After this, I don't have a choice. I got people to provide for, promises I've made, and goals to meet. Hmm. What you got?Comeback
Yo, what's going on? This is Drake
And I'ma let you know what you about to witness
This right here is a Drake and DJ Smallz collaboration
So I'm from Canada, my man's from down South
Ya understand, the number one DJ in the South to be exact
My man Smalls is out there, down south
Same time, reppin' for Toronto, Canada
So this right here, listening to right now is the official Southern Smoke Special Edition
I call it the "Room For Improvement" mixtape, cause I'm not perfect
So you need to just accept what's there, know what I mean?
From track one, to track whatever, however-many-I-put-on-here
You need to just listen to this cause look man, this is the first time
Canadian, down south, my man, Smallz, your boy, Drake
You know what it is man, so just tune in nigga
This goes out to the beautiful girls
Which, which one of y'all
I see you at the club, ooh, shawty
Walkin' past a nigga lookin' at me all naughty
Then I said, "Baby, wassup?"
Bottles of the Ace got me with a lil' buzz
Girl, when the valet pull the Benz up
Girl, sit back, relax, hold up
Let me turn the radio on
Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
Girl, you gonna think, girl, you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
Put the code in the gate, pull up to the driveway
Said she like the way I touch her, listenin' to usher
(Yup)
I got a confession
Know we 'bout to sin, but your body is a blessing
(Father, forgive me)
Girl, can we take it up stairs
(Up, up, up stairs)
My bed's waitin' there
(Waitin' there, yeah)
All I want to do is
(All I wanna do)
Won't you give me all of you?
I want your body like right now
(Right now)
You know I live a magnum lifestyle
(Lifestyle)
Baby, turn the lights down
And I'mma turn you on
Girl, when I get you to the crib
Upstairs to the bed
(Upstairs to the bed)
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
(Take the covers off)
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex
'Cause I do it like I did
You gonna think I invented sex
It's a celebration clap, clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of Moscato
For the girl who's a student and the friend who's a model
Finish the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
Yeah, and he was just practice
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl you on fire, can I be the one you match with?
I'll give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where your tats is
Show me where you heads at, maybe I can grasp it
Caught up on your ex still? I can get you past it
Yeah, and your friends all suggest
What's the chance of this nigga being better than the rest?
Just tell 'em you appreciate the help
But you just got to know for yourself
Girl, when I get you to the crib
(Get you to the crib)
Upstairs to the bed
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl, when I pull back them sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
Girl you gonna think, girl you gonna think
You gonna think I invented sex
You gonna think I invented sex
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still…
Clean in this bitch I'm feelin' myself goddamn a nigga rich
And every time I touch it guaranteed to be hit
And when them checks come guaranteed to be a split
I'm flyer then an invitation
Like I'm the information
Toronto's been waiting and I'm glad ya'll been waiting patient
But I'm here now these niggas is old news
I mix cocaine powder with the pro tools
(Whip it) Yeah crack that's just how I double back
Europeako jeans bleeding on them white air max
And these niggas keep asking me when you gon' drop
Why the fuck you keep harassing me when's that gon' stop
And they sayin' damn I use to know the boy
Now I barely see em
And the little kids wanna be him
Hook
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand em
Nigga I'm Still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
I'm still…
Fly as I wanna be kush in the air I get high as I wanna be
Rep T dot till they bury me
Automare the wrist red diamonds in the necklace
Been getting' checks while you rappers stay checkless
Real street nigga feel free to do a checklist
They don't really make em like me
Had to give you a second to breathe
Nigga ballin' still a hobby and I do that with ease
I'm bout to catch pneumonia because my neck stay freeze
I'm in the west indies
A 100 grand on a cheap white tee
Nigga I rep for my city like a football team
I'm fly like the New York Jets be
In a G5 two nines on me like Wayne Gretzky
Only holdin' up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin' that I do is me beggin' your pardon
Only tryin' that I do is me tryin' the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is "Where the rest of my commas?"
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
And they don't wanna see that you smilin' from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But that'll never happen the way I'm watchin' my step
That ain't what I'm 'bout
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
If I can't make it with you, I'll make it without
They say take the good with the bad, I'll take it without
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin' accounts?
Is there more to life than sayin' I figured it out?
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth, ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics 'bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Whenever it's time to recoup
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, "How Does It Feel?"
I got a fear of havin' things on my mind when I die
Is there any sense in doin' these songs when I'm high?
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Yachts on the 4th of July, G5 soarin' the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size?
Is there more to life than just when I'm feelin' alive?
Is there more?
Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me (Feel me)
Cupid's shot me
Tempt me, drive me (Tempt me)
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly (Highly)
It's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover for you
Ayy, yeah
Yeah
Leaving me (leavin' me)
Dippin' out on me (on me)
Already gave you what you needed, I guess (Ooh yeah)
That's why I'm not with nobody (Ooh yeah)
Cause I don't wanna hurt nobody (Ooh yeah)
Did it over text, didn't call me (Ooh yeah)
Still got love for you, mami
Even if you gotta leave somebody (Body) yeah
Most of these things I don't wanna say (Jaded)
I wanna be around while you chasin' (While you chasin' it)
You wanna hit me up when you make it
You'll try and come back when you famous
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous, oh)
You got somethin' real, not basic (Ooh yeah)
You wanna get with me, stop
Yes I'm hurting, yes I'm jaded (Jaded)
Most of these things, I don't wanna say (Say)
(Wanna be around, wanna be around)
You wanna hit me up when you make it (Ooh, yeah)
You'll try and come back when you famous
(Back around, back around)
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous)
You wanna get with me, stop (Flakin')
Yeah, dogs on this side, dogs over on this side
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Ayy, told me about all your insecurities, for what?
Dragged me like two hours to your family's house, for what?
Said you need some time but I should stick around, for what?
Always felt like stickin' 'round's the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink in, you're gettin' under my skin
Pretty little young thing (Young thing)
Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Lowdown, dirty, shameful, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)
You'll try and come back when you famous
You wanna get with me, stop (Flakin')
Your new shit sound like you do covers
Of all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they winning
On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga
That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like
Absolutely phenomenal, because we went through it all
We went through errythang...
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean like studied, you even made me a CD…
Your money is just a little Barney’s Co-Op for you to be tryna show out
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a grow-op
We move the operation to Cali soon as the snow drop
Oh stop, please stop arguin' 'bout who's the best MC
I think everyone would agree, they know that you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger poking you in your sore spot
Bars sound like I'm under oath nigga
Either I'm gettin' bigger or you're just gettin' smaller or it's both, nigga
I'm just as unforgivin' as most niggas
You bit the hand, now starve, it's not a joke nigga
I'll hang you with it after I teach you the ropes nigga
Oh well, bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And show up at the show, the afterparty, and the hotel
I hit the lobby, women's screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga
Jodeci's back
You bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she's sayin' they ain't got none
The way that I'm respondin', she know that we black, nigga
(Fuck you mean you ain’t got no condoms)
Jodeci's back
Fuckin' hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga woulda thought Def Poetry back (Cole)
Roof top, hoes turnt up
Lookin' for your bitch, bet she won't turn up
Wonder where she is, fuck could she be?
She's a ho, she's a slut, she's a freak
Count a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Ain't that what you wanted? Stuntin' on you niggas
Came in this game never frontin' on you niggas
Gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
Felt naked 'cause I laid out all my glory and my shame
Caught fire just to have niggas ignore me and my flame
'Bout to burn down the house, they tryna put me in the rain, no
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and that's just me bein' modest
Go check the numbers dummy, that's just me gettin' started
I'm artistic, you ****** ** ******** ********
Hold your applause
No need for pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole
No false gods, young Mike playin' against the Monstars
Tappin' into '94 Nas
Which is really just Slim Shady, I'm silly, my pen crazy
Today I'm out in Philly, my fans waitin' for 12 hours
Just to get their dollar signed
Thoughts stream like I'm Spotifyin'
Trenchcoat flow, bottom line
Flow dumber than your projections
This makes twice now, I doubled what you expected, yet
Your covers keep perplexin' me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is this 'bout skills or is this 'bout sales?
You legends know that we rap
Bitches screamin' like Jodeci's back
But you pick 'em up
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
I'm tired of all of these niggas
I'm tired of all of these hoes
Worried 'bout takin' my lane
They ain't even got on the road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon' be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal
I play my part too, like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything
Question is, do they believe you?
'Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin' run through
Never chase it, let it come to you
You out here tellin' everybody everything
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah
When you see them fall down
But you pick 'em up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry, I swear
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
They'll know you're trying to help 'em
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?
Boi-1da... Drizzy
Y'all don't really like me
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket on my pants
I write your favorite records, are you saying ghost?
I'm getting rich, uhh, you staying broke
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch if you throw me high-fives
They try to measure up, but there is no one my size
Whatever 40's smokin' 'bout to low my eyes
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement, I'm taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause it's about to go
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang in Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest, I'mma knock him out his place
Call me homicide Drizzy, I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-pass is as valid as can be
I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while she's smiling back at me like
I'm really stepping up my game
Can't get no more free, Randy
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
No help, that's all me, all me for real
J's on, pinky ring, dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that 'cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
I was making room for the table dancers
'Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section
Like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back
(No more free Randy) I’m blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail, we was talking through the window
That was back then, man
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do
These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
My time with you, my
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do
I love you through everything, I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk, are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?
Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do
Yeah, these days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Rock me real slowly
I'm just like a baby, droolin' over you
The things you do
How was your night pop?
??: What's the day today?
??: October 2nd, 2008
??: I'mma take the same video, on October 2nd 2009 and see if we can get in this thing without ID (?)
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
If there's any way I can help
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Always saw you for what you could've been
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
I don't know what's going on
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Much closer
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer
Any time people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
So anybody who want it can get it
Seh feh
Uh, What up y'all? Yeah
Soundtrakk, what's popping baby?
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here, I dedicate this one right here
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm talking about?
So, check it out, uh
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week, he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, uh
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And away he rolled
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
Uh, uh, uh
What up, Lupe?
Chi-Town, check
My style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
I done got some contacts and threw the glasses away
The time it took me to get cool was a massive delay, but check
It gets boring growing up in Memphis
Tryna become a pro, but keep showing up apprentice
Mama probably would've done anything to prevent this
Cause every single time I break a board, it gets expensive
Luckily, my aunt workin' as a nurse
So every time I needed something, she just reach up in her purse
And plus, she'd always give me speeches on the first
If I'm stayin' in her house, then I need to get some work
She said, "You need to be doing something other than skatin'
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
I'mma let him know that you comin', honey, he's waitin'"
So now, it's me in old school checkered plaid
Playing chess, looking through some old school record ads
He knew I didn't really wanna post here
Opened up the window and told me that the coast clear
And now I coast clear, take a deep breath
This is each test life's ever given me
A-plus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress
Kick and a snare, a kickflip in the air
The kid's sick denim jeans, put a rip in a pair
Just so the space ain't restricted in here, breathe again
Think it's obvious that they need my soul
My cousin's after Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
I said, "Auntie, this is a safe career"
She said, "Drake, I told you there was no skatin' here"
So I kick, push Kick, push
Fast as the wheels replaced
I gotta find another hobby just to fill the space
So I kick, push
Kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Coast
Peep the way I roll
And coast
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs
And their four wheels would take them there
And so they kick, push, kick, push
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
And push, yeah, yeah
Ah ha, Swanky
Lets go
Well alright, well alright
Look
Uh
Feeling sorry for the runner up
I’m still awake, getting money while the sun is up
And they keep saying how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie star doesn’t put the numbers up
Man, hate is so passé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day
Nigga and it’s just me and my money
Ya don’t even get to play when ya’ll leading by 20
Yeah I infiltrated the game
I was hesitant at first and fear what it would change
Now I’m high off the success and faded off of the fame
And still managed to keep all of my opinions the same
I am so far gone bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit
Shout out to the niggas I just made a couple million with
Know I’m into making history not into making friends
Muthafuckaaaa…
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, okay, okay, okay

Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me, I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up, I'll take the fine for that
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags

I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!
I am grateful to be able to call America my second home. Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened, emotional and truly scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something.
It's impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues.
My thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence.
Be safe out there. More life.
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm trynna live
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country y'all
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!
Yeah, its drizzy baby
Ah Ha uhh I’m ready, alright J fresh I got 'em
Look, I’m really the heir to the fortune of a millionaire
At the border like, "I swear, I have nothing to declare

How bad I want to be there

Can you work without a second for some fun?
And I know what to do with it

Now you finally got a moment to yourself, girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
Oh, it's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio
J.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in "Jodeci Freestyle". I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused. Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted. This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong. J. Cole and I believe that it is the right, responsible, and respectful decision to remove the lyric from the song.
Niggas in the city hating me man they tripping

Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
Which means if shit goes bad I say, "I expected this"
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy
I swear to you Lord
See me in the CL 6 with Haffa B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Haffa could blow a couple of stacks hassle free
I'm like fuck y'all haters on behalf on me
Cause I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking me and two part -ners in that Caprice
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
Could mould you rappers like plasticine
I have to dream, but dog
The inside of my wallet is pasture/ past your green
And you are now hanging with the asthma team
Sweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene
Call my town Sparta and I'm coming with two spears
I run my bill up making executives calls
And with me, women be building these sceptical walls
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue?
I started the game at level two
I'm sayin'
I parallel the Flying +Spur+ +Tony park+ it
And it's cool if you spill suttin it's only carpet
That's why I get my interior colour only dark shit
Toronto's where you livin' today
And you ain't making records that people are driven to play
I would advise you to really make a move, sooner than later
You feel me?
Are you familiar with this feeling
No concealing
Its out all out in the open
That virgin pussy's waiting
And Im about to poke it
Im underrated, I am Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But im about to sleep em, Acquire em', and keep em'
I require a retainer to retire them and sweep em' in a Dust pan
New guy, Too fly, who buy seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die heaven's our's
And you don't see the jag drop in here
Its like im chasing my dad the way I tag pops in in here
Lets see how many carrots we can do
Mixin' farm land green with that paratrooper blue
Who are you? You confused homie, that's a pensive look there
Doors all suicide
I should be your tour guide
Im expedia flown
And take a seat on your throne
I been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
You are not me man I could never be you at all
And yea you got a range but that shit ain't even supercharged
Aight check, flow switch, Flow switch
I don't ever pay a percentage of the retail
Schedule can change at the mention of a email
Booking up a show with some tension with a female
My Dad said to get rich you have to dig deep
Cause Drake these some big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later quarter million off of TV
I was drafting group schemes
Take us off of bus kids and turn us into coupe teams
Well woop there it is
Oops now my troops clean
First car Audi drop, Color like a poutine
Im feelin grown up, Don't ask me for id, like you know who I be, bouncer I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Cause they know the layout of the mall like I knew france
Inside and out, Therefore I been Hiding out
And you drive cars that I been riding out
Correction I been rode em out
Been showin' out, sold off shit the stories you've been told about
And dog, I been old amount
Degrassi my royalties
Homie you just owed an once
No weight move
My shoulder counts
Man, I don't even know my name anymore man (laughs)
Took her half an hour
Just to get that belt to fasten
All she wanna talk about is partying and fashion
Don't know where she going
But I do not plan on asking at all
And she, lets nobody else in except for me
I’m the only one she loves
Homie, that’s a guarantee
Don’t forget that Fendi purse that you put all your cash in
Other dudes would suffocate her, I don’t want her gaspin’
And I do not plan on asking at all
I’ve never been the type, felt alike
My connection with niggas that wanna fight
Over women, that's not right
Homie, you can have your pick
I swear that one’s my girl!
The first time, the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was "Pon de Replay," and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called "Work."
Captivating from day one, the iconic being that is Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, that's often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.
When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style, she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.
This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one.
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)
Lady, you say I stay in the house til four
Its always the same eh
Its obvious baby
You see theres a lot to lose
Cuz we got a baby
And people are shady
My generation is changin
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next
I'm tellin you baby
I think I'm a bout to cry
Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you
I hope that I see you again... again
Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
'specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
Thats how niggas puttin they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these young'ns get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good
It's what you all been waiting for ain't it
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
Since we gettin Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker
So it's obvious ya'll gone steady be rollin with some jokers
And me I'm rolling with some brokers
Like damn could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise your self, go buy a costume
(ughh) and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
Soon as you hear it you quote it
But trust me I'm aware, and my cars right there
Is this interior enough for ya'll ulterior motives
'Cause if you like it ya'll should stick with me
Alotta ice, alotta cream like Dickey Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Mishy Me
But I'mma try and have you on the trip with me
Slid in threw a Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex man is a hater officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I've done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
But at this point I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skipp
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for this zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just let's me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they pay me
Mr. betcha that's expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasty?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Life of a Don, lights keep glowing
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on
And something crazy on my arm, uh-ahem
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds
Here we Gooo
I left the cars at the house
Them things come and they go it's bout the rhyme-in Now
I'm seeing it clearer, the season is nearer
And still I must change, I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm out spoken still
He'll emerge the victim, my words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that you heard my scripture
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin' before ya'll
I barely get tired, I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week is What I'm daily required
I'm meetin' quotas while you rappers having sleep overs
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova
Be in the throne instead of being ya own
But look
Young Check your freestyle
I am fast approachin' on the weekend
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit bout to segway to the verse here we go
It's like I'm makin' moves in my city though
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin' to get with me though
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
And my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
Nigga it's the same thing
All day long
But that's the screw face
Rappers will friend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping you trip and slip over your own shoe lace
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again
Play me
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh
And I'm a make use of every single one
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... it's always been the same
It's all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway
I roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin'
Haters will say I'm adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We handin' fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how we're all endin' up
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up
Yeah, look
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
I don't give a fuck 'bout jeans and crep
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that
Big up man like Rashid, Joey, Tadas, yeah
Shoutout Giggs for settin' the ting
SN1, OVO
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Staying in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get rushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust
Yeah, yeah
Big Scorpion, out now
Yeah, look
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slewed
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
I don't give a fuck about jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
I'ma just take my knots in cash
I'ma just end that there, that's that
Drizzy Drake
Maddas, jheeze!
Shit's all good
The deal got signed
And my split's all good
And these haters pretending
That it's all good
Say that shit in person
I'm a mothafucking genius goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you
If you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me
Would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could of fooled me
And tell my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break
And these other niggas is hardly mentioned
I bet that with this pen I could draw attention
I'm just chilling in the cut, nigga what
And I'm feeling like
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
You don't wanna go there homie
Here I go
Street report
Balling over here
We need three courts
Violence, you don't wanna resort
When this money run slower than Eyore
If your life is a movie you an extra
I'm so fly, I glide Clyde Drexler
Mr. Pressure, bitch I'm fresher
They must heard that they'll never catch up
Somebody throw a sign to the catcher
I'm at the plate right now
Fuck next up
I get it, I get it, I get it till I'm done
Tell them rappers I'm the man in the city that I run
So you holla at me pimping, if you planing on a visit
And they say that you talk em when you live it
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie
I'm tryna tell you I do this
You don't wanna go there homie

And you don't even have to ask twice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it

We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it

Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
And who told you to put them jeans on?

Locker room full of money, girl you just did it

Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit

Connections are heavy, every real nigga they fuck with you
Nails chipped out in diamonds, you sparkle but fuck man
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
Tonight was your night, go get you some lobsters and shrimp
You smart and you know it, I get it I get it, you outdo these pimps
I hope you don't fall, that's you on the top of the ceiling
Don't you ever forget 'bout your story, I get it, you did it you did it

Get it, get it, get it, drop down, drop drop down
Get it, get it, get it, drop down, drop drop down
You just go to LIV after church on Sunday
Oh Lord, oh Lord we're not in Kansas anymore
I ain't what they looking for I ain't what they looking for
I ain't really Atlanta I ain't really Brooklyn or
I dont fit the appeal for them shows that they could book him for
Straight nigga tryna get in through a crooked door
Barely fittin in cuz a gimmicks what they took him for
But getting doubted caused me to reroute it
To another destination where the people they abouuut ittt!
You ever felt high above it all?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like I'm rich when I'm about ball
And think once about the clothing that I buy up out the Mall
I'm famous so I get approached fast, Louie and Coach bags
All up in coach class, gem like Topaz, cool like slow Jazz
Dope like coke lines and crack like broke glass
I promise this is me, me

I'm supposed to be this nigga thats rapping bout gettin money
Please do me a favor and keep it between me and you
You, you, you, you, you
Yea
Ok, I'm floating in my zone without a scheduled descend
The rising and the fall was never my intent
I want this shit forever printed in cement
And if I ever sin I promise to repent
I'm only tryin to win I ain't tryna present
You gotta listen close like it's coming through the vent
These rappers can't see me I live behind the tint
Little me in row 23F real reconize real is there none of yall left?
Everybody in the game can't none of yall ref?
And filter out the bullshit the fuck is yall def?

A bitch could love you to death and you still die
Ahhh!

Hey!
Hahaha

Ho!

Goddamn
I said it without sayin' it man
I know everyone is enjoying the circus but I want to clarify this image in question. This was not from a clothing brand shoot for my music career. This picture is from 2007, a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, being stereotyped and type cast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best Friend at the time Mazin Elsadig who is also an Actor from Sudan were attempting to use our voice to bring awareness to the issues we dealt with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry, and to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed much

I know you know I'm in too deep to let it go
I know it's been a year since I left you alone
(But you never say shit)
(Don't know how to take it)
We're good on our own
But I miss being home wit'cha at your place and
I drink you under tables (I drink you under tables)
Got you misbehaving (Got you misbehaving)
Buzzing your body
Body to body
You said you're over me
Now you're all over me
Body to body
You said you're over me
Now you're all over me
You block me then you hit me up
Like, "Pick me up"
I hit you back like, "Send me something
Show me something"
I ain't seen you in a year or something
So what's up
You already how i’m coming
I’m buzzin your body up
Gotta call you first like shotty
Bussin' your -- bussin' your body up
Buzzing your body
Now you're all over me
Buzzing your body
Body to body
Now you're all over me
Uh, uh-uh
Got my emotions on open mic and shit
Fancy, all this pink champagne on ice and shit
Off one glass, girl, I can see how nice you get
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
Buzzin' your body, body to body
I know, you know, I'm in too deep to let it go
I know it's been a year since I left you alone
But you never say shit, don't know how to take it
We're good on our own, but
I miss being on Wiltshire at your place, and
I drink you under tables, got you misbehavin'
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
Buzzin' in your body, body to body
Who else really try to mess with Hollywood Cole
Treating Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
This that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
I don't get shit confused
I'm not with different crews
We live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls is down to roll
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend that it's time to go
Tell me today's weather
I know they say they good but trust me I'm better
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing
If there's a sight to see I am an illusion
I tell you I'm the man baby, what is the confusion
And if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling
But fuck what they say, let me tell you how I'm feeling
I'm drinking, these London street lamps got a real glow
Drizzy playin' driving fast but it feels slow
And ask your man, he's a hater baby he don't know
This here was meant to get buried
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely
I ain't lyin' to the kids, like the dentist ain't scary
Pulling McClarens through a McDonald's drive through lane
I'm too fly, keep it hip-hop like Afu Ra
Girl on that McClaren, you gotta lift the doors
This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, you're used to it
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with
So you still think I'm confident, and damn
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you, and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Late, late, late, late
Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late?
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new (Brand new), brand new (Brand new), brand new
Show me if this is brand new (Brand new)
(Is anything I'm doin' brand new?)
But, I'm not really sure what else you expected
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it
I mean, I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together
Yeah, not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But, I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga
Out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal
These kids'll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
We ain't in it, we just ghost ride
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time
But just know it'll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin'
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations durin' regular seasons
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Ahh nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer to My Dreams
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all of the shit I've seen and the things I believe
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
4,000 square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
See you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put their arm around you
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
That they care to see where it goes from there
But these ain't the girls from Brampton
This ain't that local action
The haters just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
You niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to
Ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú, young pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I was destined for this shit
When I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was poppin' off with "Ain't I"
Way before niggas had they hands out
Like they doin' macarena
But, who am I to complain now, I'm still around, they know
This here is on some truthful shit
Its seems like everything I do your use to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with!
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside
So you still think I'm confident and damned
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
(Aye Aye Aye)
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
So I dont ever question you and damn
I can't even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask, is anything I'm doing brand new?
(chorus)
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new girl
(Aye Aye Aye)
(Lil Wayne)
This here on some remix shit
Seems like ever thing I do they leakin it
And I hate hearing stories of who im sleeping with
I swear I got to hide what I got in my ride
So she still think im confident and damn
My life is on the pedestal, am I moving to fast?
Feel like im in crazy competition with my past
That's why I gotta ask
Is anything im doing brand new
(chorus)
Is anything I'm doing brand new?
(Lil Wayne)
Dont blame me if any man would if he knew better(um huh)and dont won't to here about him anymore
But I know you heared this song before..
(Drake)
Is everything I'm doing too late(6x)
Did he take off your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
On the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late?
(chorus w/Drake)
Is anything im doing brand new?
Brand new brand new
Show me if this is brand new, new
(Lil Wayne)
And this is the remix baby weezy baby,drizzy, yung mula baby
Even though you're all alone
All alone when I am gone
I just wanna keep you warm
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, yeah, yes, I'll be there
'Cause when I'm all alone, I think about your face
All I wanna do is give all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me
(Check it out, check it out)
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, oh, yes, I'll be there, oh
About to board a flight, sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you but I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh
Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
(Check it out, check it out)
*Lyrics from Snippets*
...the offer you gave me was preposterous
Papi, this bird won't fly, you sold me an ostrich
I ain't playin' my nigga, go ahead and giggle
But bullets don't tickle
If you think you playin' with Elmo, hell no
If you was in a pine box (Box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in an-and fall asleep (I fall asleep)
If you was in a pine box (Box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep (I fall asleep)
'Cau-'cau-'cause you are the death of me
'Cause you are, the-the death of me, you-you, the death of me
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar, women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
'Cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
Hit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me
A false word like the rappers I know
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as… myself
And it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you're outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody they already know
We've been living on a high, they've been talking on the low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
Man these niggas need to stop it they be crowding up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it -- all that pride and self esteem
Got you angry about this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Trying to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
Before I'm on the next ting, YMCMB (ah)
Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight I’ll ease your mind
That’s why I’m calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
It’s hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, (ay)
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team
You just know what you get told girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gonna have to get it cleaned
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be your knight in shining armor all tires
Girl, they love me like I'm Prince, like the new king with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down (ah)
Ooh finally got you right here
Tonight I’ll ease your mind
That’s why I’m calling on you
And ooh soft your loves desire
It’s hard to stay away
You keep me calling on you
How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay)
How you mean, how you mean, thought you knew about the team (ay)
Just mail me my ring back, can't keep that shit.
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Yeah, can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I bring you to the six where I really stay, baby?
Show you why I am the way I am
I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby?
Tell me who the fuck you want to be
'Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Can I call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?
Sorry, I don't really have a choice
Can I ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby?
Can I finally take the time and open up to you, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time
Can I, baby? Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out one more time
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Before I turn the lights out
How could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, maybe you'll walk away
Like my big bro say, I'm goin in
Olimpic loser money, I just glad I learned to swim
CAnnonball, bitch, I hope dive untill it's 30
And these haters like, damb m
Gave a lot of women they first ride in the phantom
And yeah, I got a deal now, and I'm secure with it
And yet my life is so exciting, I get bored with it
I'm the best one out of my peers, and everybody pray I'm running out of ideas
Past my MOs, cause I shine so bright
Critics have hard time pointing out the flaws
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall
Right out of the sky, through the roof of your garage
How could I fly, but lose it all
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you'll walk away, maybe you'll walk away
Set me up, and let me off
Uh, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen
Want a lot, can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything
Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'
Damn, I must be coachin', 'cause I'm not playin' with them
Can you not see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fuckin' lights on in the buildin'
Can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything but I want everything
Finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak
I gave them back a clean plate
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, "Are we straight?"
Two-faced niggas back around with the three face
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face
Y'all fuckin' hilarious
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, East side, all that for my area
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.
Uh, yeah man, uh
I feel real good right about now
I ain't even been gone yet I ain't even
Taken a leave of absence but I feel like I'm back
Yeah man
Check, I roll with the coalition, when no one listened
I spoke out now niggas is throwing this in
You gassed up, my vehicle low emission
I can enter your field trip with no permission
Slip, i've done it before told ya I run it before
Now the city is mine, and what you thought it would be
Ain't a rapper working harder than me I put my heart in T
Uh, ?, carry the city on my back like a Jansport
Homie, u make a lot of music niggas ain't feeling
You rappers shouldn't rap, you rappers should paint ceilings
That's why I ain't competitive y'all, cuz deep down I know im much better than y'all
Watchu mean do I actually flow, wanna know if I actually flow just ask V-O
Im tryna make the wrist on my cousin ashley glow till she waken up by someone and it actually snow
We keep it on and poppin like the dance scene in Thriller
This the new version fresh prince and andreana miller
And d-10tion the boi-1da
And people focused on keeping the boy under
Probably cuz I don't act like y'all
And I ain't gotta sell crack like y'all
Well not really, I mean I do move crack in a disc form
But thats only because I don't rap like y'all
And now its occurring to them
Its starting to be my friend is reassuring to them
Either that or every verse im referring to them
So catch me in a zone till they leave me alone
Uh, and thats just what it is
You feel me
Benard I see ya homie
Precise I see ya
Ransom, brandon I see ya
Yea JD Era I see ya
Mayhem maury er I see ya
Yea that's the coalition
D-10tion boi-1da the commitment
Andreana I see you baby
Sox yea, row
You know
Uh, we keep it goin, there's no stopping it
Yea you got an entry flow, you gotta stick around for the whole century flow nigga
That's how I do it holla at me
And thats it
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Ayy
UberX to Hidden Hills
Give me somethin' I can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills
Then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road
I be out here on my own
I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town
'Til we run 'em out of town
Gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way
Skid around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
Ayo, blast that shit, Maxx
Back and forth to Italy
My comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate
Y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm– I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO
Especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay
Man, just stay up out my way
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
But you never change up
44, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
You build it up to break it halfway through
But you're just the same as I ever knew
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
44, 22
Just make the call, 22
But you're just the same as I ever knew
I know I fear trust
I know I fear fear too much
On my plate, lookin' up
Outer space, Pearly Gates
I'm runnin', but can't run away
You say you changed
All night I've, been staring, can you tell I want you?
Can't be too, wide open, there's nothing, I won't do
Oh, just thought you should know
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious
I wish I, wasn't famous
I wish I, was still in school
So that I could have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you, crazy
That's when you start to laugh
Saying I just want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming I'm just not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew, this is serious
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Up all night
Stop, stop, stop…
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
I’m charged up, I’m charged up
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so and so’s that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
I’m charged up
Oh no we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggin'
Trust me this information is vital
I’m tryin' to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!
Have you seen me?
I’m doing so good
Every time we meet:
"Oh, I’m so sorry."
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)
"You know, I kept it real
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak."

In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage

Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?

Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Thank you, thanks, Drake, thanks baby
Motherfuckers drunk and tired
Tired, I'm tired, boss
This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin'
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin'
Chasin' fat stacks, runnin' down grands and submission
I don't back track, every single sound for me different
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up
Anybody I'm standin' beside's all bossed up
Burglar minded they say I'm servin' them rhymers
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater, uh
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow
Peep though, when I get fed up, it’s sped up
Riding through the streets, just reclining in my seat hoe
Uh, them city lights is looking brighter, its 3 a.m. in the morning An' the pen is like a lighter
I done said it, I give you the unleaded, just tip me, if your tank Is empty come get me
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections
And it's nothing that I created on purpose
There's people that gotta problem
But they scared to let it surface, uh
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but
You got a debt and you choose not to pay that
I'mma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh
It ain't a problem of concern bruh
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh
So hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of
And if anybody hatin' on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy
Yo, the city is mine  (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
Pull up, range rove, yo chick, wanna roll
And I play myself in the stereo
And I make 'em wanna
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
Shake shake it, drop it drop it
Bounce it bounce it, wop it wop it
Girl, move that thang like you gettin money for college, go!
After that, break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
Break it, Break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, Break it down
Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like [Andreena harmonizes]
I'mma spare y'all
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say "My baby's famous and I knew it" (yeah)
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill
Yeah I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest"
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Dinnertime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home
Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman
(Sing it to' em 'Dreena) lights 'bout to go down, curtains 'bout to close but
I want y'all to enjoy yourself on the way out, yeah man

Yeah
I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time, like
What it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then, but
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin', I can't stop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels and they silencin' you back
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years
It's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' dranks on me
Nah
Singin' off-key like (vocalizes)
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option

Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out
Closer to my dreams (Miss Andreena Mill)
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah (Yeah man)
I feel it in my sleep (Sing it to 'em baby)
I said I'm gettin' higher
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough-
Well
You can fill the blank in
Just tryna place in the rankin'
They can't
Play pen drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
Charcoal charger
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Showed her I'mma
I told her I'mma
Bout to get my run-on so hold the commas
Times changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home
Closer to my dreams
Yeah
I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
You know what it is man
It's ya boy, D-R-A-K-E
I'm almost there, yeah
Ha, yeah
They say that all your old girls got somebody new
I said, "Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?"
They said, "Fucking right, they were the first to go"
It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With "I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you"
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year
She like, "Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?"
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Uh, but believe I remember it all
My mother is back to who she was years ago
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave to myself
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it
'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now
Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know?
Well, you ask plenty musicians – them know it, but them can't do it
Some people still searching for this truth here
I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, "Is that a rose?"
"You mean Rosé? Why yes it is"
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style, you're in need of ya own, man
Verse 1: Drake
I always wonder why you bother putting makeup on
And even though I always tell you that you're beautiful
I'll repeat it
Cause I don't want no singer, I don't want no model
And I don't want no fashion designer or nothing
I just want your love
I promise you that's more than enough for me
Chorus:
All you gotta do is come real
Shawty what the deal?
Dont think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way (2x)
Verse 2: Kyoko
Baby just because I wanna look good
Don't mean that I ain't real
All the clothes and doing of my hair, face, nails
Make me feel good
And I'll keep it up
Im not sayin what you been stayin to me
Ain't exactly
What I need to feel and know
You're the one I'm wearing for
And where I'll always go when I need a real love
Kyoko Chorus:
So stay real
What you make me feel
Is true beauty of the ultimate appeal
And I don't want it any other way (2x)
Yeah
All you self-promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down
Especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs
They hit my phone like, "You did that"
It's always on some shit like
"When can I get a favor?" or, "Where my bitch at?"
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist
Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?"
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Yeah, I make you dance to this
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder
Sun shinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind
Yeah, and we can't stop
Make you dance to this, uh
A-ha-ha-ha, ha
Bad breed, bad bwoy
That's right, yeah
We had the type of nights where mornin' comes too soon
And nothin' was the same
Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?
Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been? You deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man
The whole up North
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter
But listen
I met this new girl late June or early July
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?"
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in
And some places is breezy, and some it start snowin'
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet
Then she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern
Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right
Uh, ya man, it's what it is
And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town
And stupid me I just listen to her
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch
When we were together it seeming like way back when
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
I miss you, most of all, my darling [Beat fades out]
(give me a second to gather my thoughts)
And watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)
(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)
(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)
I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup
So we can get back to them cognac nights
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild
The winter came and blew his cold air through
By the end of the week I would know that crew
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation
Granted the fact that we one man short
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside
We'll never talk again, scary and true
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it
And when they talk about they past and lovers
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring
That shit was wack as fuck
I was like, 'You won. Why are you posting your text message? Just chill. Take your W, and if you feel you didn't deserve it, go get better — make better music. It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilt? You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won?
This is how the world works: He made a brand of music that appealed to more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. Whether people wanna say it's racial, or whether it's just the fact that he tapped into something we can't tap into. That's just how the cards fall. Own your shit
I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Is you single or what? I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky, I need a shawty from Houston
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
But we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin'
On some "why-you-love-these-strippers?" shit
Oh, me, I don't deserve it (at least you fuckin' know it)
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man, I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
Hit me when you're done your shift
I need some company, I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby, heat baby
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby
I'm in heat baby...
Mo City trip! Mo City trip right now! Yeah
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
Ayy, ayy, a Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby, heat baby
I'm a dog, I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
When she get too on, we take if off
Drank so long, for a year I didn't cough
Mo City trip right now, Mo City trip right now
Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love, X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations
So what you want an award or somethin'?
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off your chest"
And I'm what all the fuss about
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention
Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love, X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin'
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations
So what you want an award or somethin'?
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off your chest"
And I'm what all the fuss about
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention
It’s crack
Ayy yo Drizzy, you shoulda said that on the hook
You shoulda been like, “Congratulations, it’s crack”
Yah
It’s crack, hehe, congratulations
Ladies and gentlemen!
Isn't it amazing?
How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different"
Oh, the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging
Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends, if you're looking
And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby
Yeah, swanging
She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And I'd allow her
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler
She used to say: "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was
And never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me
I'll be here just swanging
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby
I'll be here, just swanging
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to 401 east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin'
I'll be there just swangin'

Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving this crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving this crew
They loving the crew
Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Whoa
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though
Uh, you underestimated greatly
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?
Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah
Yeah, why you keep askin' me about... (Why?)
Why am I the one you wanna get into it with for the drama?
I've got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now
Spendin' all my days on the east side, oh
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now
Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me
Why you keep askin' me about... (Why?)
Couple other things I'd rather do than talk about that right now
Told you 'bout givin' him chances on chances on chances
He's not holdin' you down, he's holdin' you back right now
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now
Love it when your ass speak the truth to me, oh
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over
When I get there, you already know, call me
Yeah, ayy
Ayy
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house
She made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, "When that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know"
Girls talkin' 'bout, "You gotta leave already?"
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you little help, you need more already
So you know that that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for Third Ward already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime say you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy
You would prolly kill another man for the boy
You would prolly...
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy, yeah
(Why? Fring)
Ayye Yo DJ Wristpect let's get em'
Veterans like "How dare all of this arrogance"
What you expect when all they do is draw comparisons between us and Americans
And tell me go hard well I'm going harder now
Bumpin Shawn Carter cause there ain't a Shawn Carter now, feel me
Get with it, I'm trying to overthrow a nation using fade to black as a nigga's only motivation
I'm picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent is proven
A show of hands who's in?
And if you must know, this year I'm going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am  have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that Prada love me
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for Trinity Chris word
So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mimosas with the clicquot
What up Nikko, Jordan, Lucky and TJ nicknamed the Night Fox clique we take it easy
You Prime Ministers claim you repping the T, I need a Motherfucking president to represent me nigga
I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man
Shut the lights off
Guess I'll call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments
Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
Until you take from me till the point that you can't give
And when I see you out I pass by it's offensive
But what you expect though
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
I ain't ya understudy thats tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cause now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip
Oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
Deceiving you are the reason that
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing
Cause when I say I'm serious you claim you're only teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple years I guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin' waitin' patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cause I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losing a feeling
You losing appealing
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
My first reaction was damn girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But you was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin' ya thing too
Sayin' to my self you deceiving
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
In fact I know you always be lyin' when u be leavin'
Goin' to visit family promise me you ain't cheatin'
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga
How you think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't
And make u think u get the ass when you really won't
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
Feel like uh
I feel like we back man (yeah)
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk about
Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy?"
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
They tell me "don't worry, I got your money" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, "Where does the day go?"
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
I love, I love
Baby, I
I turn the phone off, I let the seat back
The jet-setta and forever will I get chedda
And y'all will only get cash when you get betta
Check luggage, flow to a new city
Plus, the hoodie cover my eyes
I'm too pretty, nah, I'm just playin'
Heavy is how I weigh in
Top floor with a view of the water is what I stay in
But y'all don't hear me, yeah, y'all ain't relatin'
Well, let me tell you what happens when I be datin'
Catch me at the hotel and try and get they cash
You tryna sex me for money is quite twisted
Prior to fall, I was lying to y'all
So if you gettin' one ring, I'm denyin' ya call
Let him be, let him do it on his own
He a G, he just doing his thing
Gotta love that
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feeling where he's at let him know
He just doing his thing
Now my momma kinda iffy, My uncle kinda shifty
Expenses at this point have cost a little over fifty
The hummer and the range was in someone else's name
Hope my city's reputation for the summer's gonna change
I hope you stick around and see it
Cause if you ain't around I'll bring your chick around to see it
Until she catch feelings and I have to let her go
And when I park my car outside she'll stick around and key it
Repercussions of a cheap lash
And get attached do insane things
Take new jewelry and put it down the drain things
Mr. Busy, Mr. Recieve the shipment
Let him breathe, let him live
Let him be, let him do it on his own
Let him go, let him fall
Let him grow, if you feelin where he's at let him know
He just doin his thing
Gotta love that
When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
(Oh ho, oh ho)
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you, too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
I know they ain't getting money like we do
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
Tonight I’m into breaking up
Somebody’s home
I’m drunk as ever
I’m not alone, (I I I)
I know you love it
I don’t just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Im headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it
That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I’m polite about it
Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where’d I put my bow tie
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
And me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, still run the committee
NY forever nigga, Diddy
Uh, yeah, alright
Yeah, well alright
Feel good
It's a celebration, clap-clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of moscato
For the girl who's a student and her friend who's a model
Finished the whole bottle and we gonna do it big like this
He ain't in your world, you can take him off your atlas
Girl ya on fire can I be the one you match with
I give you the credit card and baby you can max this out
Show me where ya tats is
Show me where ya hands at, maybe I can grasp it
They say if ya get her you can understand her better
And she known to be a cheater but that's only if you let her
So when they talk they try deter me it's like whatever
Tell em' I appreciate the help but I just gotta know for myself
This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage ya
Especially when you think noone is understanding ya
These girl groups with they overprotective managers
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate
Goodness gracious on top is such a hard place
Yea... but if you never even been there
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in ya swimwear
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself
Hand on my heart
Yeah, stylin’ though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
I want to make sure they learn from me
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary
More Life

You too worried 'bout the bitches (What you worried 'bout?)

I'm about to say a true thing (Yeah)
I'm about to say a true thing (Yeah)
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
Goddamn, you changed
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this, I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
Yeah, so I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Why you over there lookin at me
The temporary happiness he might provide ya
I know that I feel her, but slowly I'm kinda like
"I don't really wanna hit this girl"
And so she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'mma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playin around
It gets deeper and cold-ER, the funny thing is
I'm writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like...
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Look...we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreat thing
But that was then, you know some hush-hush
Plus your man still there, let's be fair
You'll do the same things to me
I'on't wanna take the place of he!
Late night's 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, cause I been the other man
And you not gonna trap me witcha silly lil plan
It's my bad, shoulda chose a wo-man
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl playin
I'm sayin, you need to do what you do
I'm not tryna take it any further with you, c'mon
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Uh...uh...I met her at the bar sippin on Patron
And now it's been three years off and on
Cause the same page, we are rarely off and on
Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (c'mon)
We lost contact like Bausch & Lomb
But regained it while she was buildin her house a home
It just proves that, she don't know what to do wit her life
Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
One minute she mad at me, next minute it's all good
And I'm in her body like Gray's Anatomy
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (uh)
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, "Damn, if only her nigga knew", but...
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Two years ago, a friend of mine
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!
Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue

Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your vision's just been distorted
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, you’re clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
It’s like a offensive foul how they running to us
Lord I got ‘em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, plus the eggs and ham
Let the sucker burn, I don’t even flip 'em over
Nickelus F. teamed with Drake, now you mad as hell
Ain’t seen a better looking union since Gabrielle
Well, I'm hot as hell and I don’t even need a stylist
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You’re running up our animals like white boys, they cow-tip
Everybody knows Cap from the south of Wallis
I ain’t gotta use a fist, slap you with the chalice
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do

(Look out, look out)
Yeah

Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later, how am I the man still?
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side, bitch, we stay winnin'
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for ya
Yeah, suits and ties yellin' out, "Pay the guys"
Man, I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
Man, you know I had to—
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it, yeah
I mean, for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to— oh, wait, sidebar, left some beat at the end
SZN

It's hard to go from kid tv show to rapper
It is, it is, but you know, the more and more, we were consistent, it proved, it turned from a flaw to an attribute. You know, it's like, it makes the story better, I think at this point
We started just putting songs out-
Every, every, like I said, I'm very humbled by it, I feel very blessed. And umm, yeah, I'm never gonna let it set in, I just wanna keep, I just wanna keep working to be honest with you
Ride the wave, baby, ride the wave. And you have some big interest too, like, I know you're working. There's one with Lil' Wayne, and you did, umm, just talk in the studio with some different people, can you talk about yet or no?

Forever Fif
Yo, yo, yo. This is your boy, Christopher [?], that’s right, [?], chilling with my main man, Drake. On the off-the-hook from this tape. You know how we get down. That’s how we do it, the real house party, baby. Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!
What up? This Kim. Damn, I’ve been trying to get at you all week. Why don’t you call me back?
Okay, I lied. Damn, I swear. Just call me back
Okay! Alright! [?] hit it too! Why don’t you just call me back?
Hey, yo, Drake, you never answer your goddamn phone, huh? Pick up the phone, man. I know they got you running around, bro. Anyway, it’s all good with Socrates hooking you up, dawg. Hey, best wishes for this tape. I hope you take over the world. You know we gon' do it. You make sure you get me on there. You call me when you need that hook, you call me when you need that beat, you call me when you need that [hot 16], bro, and let’s put this whole mathematics together, dawg. Once again, it’s a whole gang from Room for Improvement, so we about to be taking over this year, right? Riiight
Yo, Drake. What up? This is Keeyaga, your boy here. Umm, I don’t know why you’re not picking up the phone, you’re probably out, you know, talking to Lindsay Lohan, or will be talking to her eventually. But, yo, check it out, it’s your boy Keeyaga. I’m just calling to say what up, haven’t talked to you in forever, indefinitely. You know, we need to go, you know, downtown Toronto, kick it together and do what we gotta do, but, uh, I gotta, you know, get off the phone because I have, you know, Beyoncé, you know, even Mendes all on the other line. So, yo, do what you gotta do, and holla at your boy man. All the best. Peace
You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em
Look for me!
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
"My life has got to be like this, it's got to keep going up."
"I've been in several things, I was in the drug business, then I was in the oil business, but I'm not in either one now, you understand?"

"Who is he anyhow, an actor?"

My boy Sig said
He was on a tier where no tears can fall
'Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See in my inner circle, all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, 'cause I've really been there before
Never far behind, 'cause I think too forward
All about the grind like me so horny
Warned you early on about my mindset
You thought it was an empty bomb threat
'Til I flew into the building like 100 Osamas
Said to do a few millions
Expose the world to a hustler's true feelings
I came into this game with nothing to prove
You'll never stop a nigga in that type of mood
So every move I make confuse the industry
I'm out for presidents to represent me
D-P 3
D-P 3
Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
Jacksons go back then we cop us some mo'
The Benjamins go in the stash box under the floor
I'm out for presidents to represent me, now you know

Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.
They say "They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone."
So on that note, I'm leavin' after the song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear
'Cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.
Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seein' me
So, with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass
I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me movin' this crack
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.
Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst 'til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made, every sister I played
‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade...
And that's why I wrote this book. I love writing rhymes. There's probably nothing that gives me as much pleasure. There have been times in my life when I've tried to put it to the side--when I was a kid, so I could focus on hustling in the streets, and when I was an adult, so I could focus on hustling in the boardroom--but the words kept coming. They're still coming and will probably never stop. That's my story. But the story of the larger culture is a story of a million MCs all over the world who are looking out their windows or standing on street corners or riding in their cars through their cities or suburbs or small towns and inside of them the words are coming, too, the words they need to make sense of the world they see around them. The words are witty and blunt, abstract and linear, sober and fucked up. And when we decode that torrent of words — by which I mean really listen to them with our minds and hearts open — we can understand their world better. And ours, too. It's the same world.
Part I
My life after childhood has two main stories: the story of the hustler and the story of the rapper, and the two overlap as much as they diverge. I was on the streets for more than half of my life from the time I was thirteen years old. People sometimes say that now I'm so far away from that life - now that I've got businesses and Grammys and magazine covers - that I have no right to rap about it. But how distant is the story of your own life ever going to be? The feelings I had during that part of my life were burned into me like a brand. It was life during wartime.On "Public Service Announcement"
even when a rapper is just rapping about how dope he is, there’s something a little bit deeper going on. It’s like a sonnet, believe it or not. Sonnets have a set structure, but also a limited subject matter. They are mostly about love. Talking on such a familiar subject and writing about it in a set structure forced sonnet writers to find every nook and cranny in the subject and challenged them to invent new language for saying old things. It’s the same with braggadacio in rap. When we take the most familiar subject in the history of rap -- why I'm dope -- and frame it within the sixteen bar structure of a rap verse, synced to the specific rhythm and feel of the track, more than anything it’s a test of creativity and wit. It’s like a metaphor for itself; if you can say how dope you are in a completely original, clever, powerful way, the rhyme itself becomes proof of the boast’s truth. And there are always deeper layers of meaning buried in the simplest versesFrom Negative Space section
Hip-hop has always been controversial, and for good reason. When you watch a children's show and they've got a muppet rapping about the alphabet, it's cool, but it's not really hip-hop. The music is meant to be provocative - which doesn't mean it's necessarily obnoxious, but it is (mostly) confrontational, and more than that, it's dense with multiple meanings. Great rap should have all kinds of unresolved layers that you don't necessarily figure out the first time you listen to it. Instead it plants dissonance in your head. You can enjoy a song that knocks in the club or has witty punch lines the first time you hear it. But great rap retains mystery. It leaves shit rattling around in your head that won't make sense till the fifth or sixth time through. It challenges you
Which is the other reason hip-hop is controversial: People don't bother trying to get it. The problem isn't in the rap or the rapper or the culture. The problem is that so many people don't even know how to listen to the music
Since rap is poetry, and a good MC is a good poet, you can’t just half-listen to a song once and think you’ve got it. Here’s what I mean: A poet’s mission is to make words do more work than they normally do, to make them work on more than one level. For instance, a poet makes words work sonically - as sounds, as music. Hip-hop tracks have traditionally been heavy on the beats, light on melody, but some MCs - Bone Thugs ‘N Harmony, for example - find ways to work melodies into the rapping. Other MCs - think about Run from Run-DMC - turn words into percussion: cool chief rocka, I don’t drink vodka, but keep a bag of cheeba inside my locka. The words themselves don’t mean much, but he snaps those clipped syllables out like drumbeat, bap bap bapbap. It’s as exciting as watching a middleweight throw a perfect combination. If you listened to that joint and came away thinking it was a simple rhyme about holding weed in a gym locker, you’d be reading it wrong: The point of those bars is to bang out a rhythmic idea, not to impress you with the literal meaning of the words
But I can’t say I’ve ever given much of a fuck about people who hear a curse word and start foaming at the mouth. The Fox News dummies. They wouldn’t know art if it fell on them.
Part 2: I WILL NOT LOSE
What's the basic motivation for a hustler? I hit the streets for the same reason a lot of other kids do: I wanted money and excitement and liked the idea of cutting myself loose from the rules and low ceilings of the straight world. The truth is that most kids on the corner aren't making big money--especially if you break their income down into hourly wage.* But they're getting rewarded in ways that go beyond dollars and cents. The kid on the streets is getting a shot at a dream. The dream is that he will be the only one to make this hustling thing pay off in a big way. He sees the guy who gets rich and drives the nice car and thinks, yep, that'll be me. He ignores the other stories going around, about dudes who get shot or beaten to death with bricks and chains. But they're working that corner for more than whatever small cut they get of the crack they sell--they're working because they're due for a miracle. The kid in McDonald's gets a check and that's it. There's no dream in fast food. Manager? That's a promotion not a dream. It took me a long time to realize how much courage it took to work at McDonald's, to walk through the streets past rows of hustlers wearing that orange uniform. But at the time, it seemed like an act of surrender to a world that hated us. I never even considered it a possibility.
When you've got a nation of hustlers working for a small amount of slots, you learn something that you'll never learn at McDonald's. You learn to compete hard, even when you lose, because you can't settle for second-best as a hustler. It's not worth it. The only reason to do it is for the top slot, for the number one position... Sort of like the music business. *[The gang leader’s] hourly wage was $66…the foot soldiers earned just $3.30 an hour. In other words, a crack gang works pretty much like the standard capitalist enterprise: you have to be near the top of the pyramid to make a big wage…so if crack dealing is the most dangerous job in America, and if the salary is only $3.30 an hour, why on earth would anyone take the job?”
--Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner,  Freakonomics
Part 3: POLITICS As USUAL
 Poor people in general have a twisted relationship with the government. We're aware of the government from the time we're born. We live in government-funded housing and work government jobs. We have family and friends spending time in the ultimate public housing, prison. We grow up knowing people who pay for everything with little plastic cards — Medicare cards for checkups, EBT cards for food. We know what AFDC and WIC stand for and we stand for hours waiting for bricks of government cheese. The first and fifteenth of each month are times of peak economic activity. We get to know all kinds of government agencies not because of civics class, but because they actually visit our houses and sit up on our couches asking questions. From the time we're small children we go to crumbling public schools that tell us all we need to know about what the government thinks of us.
Then there are the cops.
Housing projects are a great metaphor for the government's relationship to poor folks: these huge islands built mostly in the middle of nowhere, designed to warehouse lives. People are still people, though, so we turned the projects into real communities, poor or not. We played in fire hydrants and had cookouts and partied, music bouncing off concrete walls. But even when we could shake off the full weight of those imposing buildings and try to just live, the truth of our lives and struggle was still invisible to the larger country. The rest of the country was freed of any obligation to claim us. Which was fine, because we weren't really claiming them, either.
When I first started working on this book, I told my editor that I wanted it to do three important things. The first was to make the case that hip-hop lyrics--not just my lyrics, but those of every great MC--are poetry if you look at them closely enough. The second was I wanted the book to tell a little bit of the story of my generation, to show the context for the choices we made at a violent and chaotic crossroads in recent history. And the third piece was that I wanted the book to show how hip-hop created a way to take a very specific and powerful experience and turn it into a story that everyone in the world could feel and relate to.
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"I can't die, I can't die, I can't die"
This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win
But then again, maybe it's for the best though
You know they're tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins, ends
It gets dangerous, money and power is changin' us
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"I can't die, I can't die, I can't die"
We used to fight for building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killin'
The closest of friends when we first started
But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee?
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Don't cry, it is to be; in time
I'll take away your miseries and make it mine, D'evils
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Secret society, tryna keep they eye on me"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"Dear God – I wonder, can you save me?"
"I can't die, I can't die, I can't die"
My flesh no nigga could test, my soul is possessed
By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The Exorcist got me doin' sticks
Like, "Homie, you don't know me
But the whole world owe me, strip!"
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothin' nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off – Momma, forgive me
Got me runnin' with guys, makin' G's, tellin' lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower
For the love of money, son, I'm givin' lead showers
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils
"I can't die, I can't die, I can't die"
Can you hear me now? Good! (Blueprint 2 baby!)
The best of times, it was the worst of times (aoww)

Young is eternal, my youngins'll burn you
"The Blueprint" birthed, nigga I earthed you, you can't be serious
Young 'cause I'm thirty-two, dressed like I'm twenty-two
Flow like a 18, do what I wanna do
Rose Gold with black karats, Horse & Carriage to spend
Like Mason Betha, chasin' this cheddar to the end
Of the road because the end I'm told is nearer than we know
What can I say but live for today, HOV'!
R.O.C. yeah, number one clique here
If you represent us, throw them diamonds up YEAH
Now that you know, holla at your boy

You put on two tube socks, you couldn't walk in my shoes
I was dealt a bad hand, fuck what else could I do
But can you believe, everywhere I'm at, models come through
Cat-fightin', cat-walkin', it happens often
It's true how society don't want me to move
Into the penthouse building with spectacular views
They're like uhh, "He's a menace he could never be a tenant"
I bring the brothers to the building give a feeling that I don't
Give a fuck we just chillin' watchin' chandelier ceilings high as fuck
Old lady, don't blow my high
Sharpton in it 'cause I'm dark-skinned-ed or
Dude with the 'fro and the Rainbow Coalition, I'ma
Victim of a single parent household, born in a mouse hole
Mousetrap, niggas wanna know
How so, how Jay get up out that, here, yeah
I snatched purses, I per-se-vered, yeah
I had work, fiends purchased, it was clear
I was out there sellin' hope for despair, but stop there
I swear, I only make good from my mouth to God's ears
Had to get out the hood
And I can't justify genocide
But I was born in the city where the skinny niggas die
Born in the city where the skinny niggas ride
And as a skinny nigga I had beef with high size
R.O.C. yeah, number one clique here
If you represent us, throw them diamonds up YEAH
Now that you know, holla at your boy
HOV'.. (Hov', Hov', Hov')

Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)

They like, “That’s why they call you Hov”
I’m like, “Yeah”
Won’t tear one tissue, no tears, no tissue, not an issue
Don’t cry for me
Got a front row seat even if you don’t speak
Silent partner, I hear you loud and clear
I’m just waiting til’ you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in
Then I’m gon' body them
It's nothing but a hobby to him
Simple as a serve in volley to him
Niggas like, “Hov', why don’t you get at ol’ boy?”
Why kill a puppet and leave Geppetto alive?
Why not wait to catch them all together?
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss comin' (Yes)
Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?)
Nothin’ left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Came, conquered)

How is niggas dissin' me
I made it possible
For niggas to make history
How is this possible?
Please explain this shit to me
How is it logical?
It's like the disciples, dissing Jesus and becoming his rivals
Shunning the one thing that they owe they life to
Think I’m in the office, I’m off my grind?
That’s how kids become orphans
You lost ya mind?
I keep my enemies close
I give ‘em enough rope
They put themselves in the air
I just kick away the chair
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss comin' (Yes)
Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?)
And now what’s that you talking bout we gon see now (We gon' see now)
Dig a hole (Go ahead)

Hov gon' get you, I ain’t forget your lil' disrespect
No ho, daddy gon' spank you for that shit you said
It's hard to do when you’ve got nothing to prove
Cause even when you win, ultimately you lose
Real niggas like, “Why Hov talking to Dude?”
You sellin' low too, only time you went plat
My chain was on your neck, that’s an actual fact
So I’m prayin’ that it spills outside of the booth
That’s when ya’ll niggas outside of your truth
Niggas throwin' Roc signs outside of your Coupe
Don’t look at Hov like he done something wrong to ‘em
Cause he’s on to 'em
He just took what belonged to him
You niggas is playing checkers with chess-playing Hov
This game is over, I don’t know if ya’ll know
You in the hole
Told ya to get ya money when you see a boss comin' (Yes)
Thought shit was funny, but watch what you see now (What you see now?)
Nothin’ left to accomplish, I done came out and conquered (Came, conquered)
And now what’s that you talking bout we gon see now (We gon' see now)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)

Dig a hole (Muthafucka bury yourself)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Jay-Z: You ain’t got enough stamps in your passport to fuck with Young H.O
Ice Cube: Don Dada
Ice Cube: Papa Doc
Jay-Z: Show young boys how to do this thing
Ice Cube: You know me, Ice Cube
My life had yet to show its ugly face
Only a pretty façade, hey God, it's me
Remember three, thousand
The one who used to pray to be a rapper
His favorite rapper wasn't rapping 'til he heard me
I wasn't rapping till I heard something called Eric B
And Rakim's Paid in Full
Rap is really getting paid in full
So full that the kids don't go to school
In hopes of becoming one of us
Now college is looking slim, product is hooking them
Before their brains fully develop, they get enveloped by the  vision teller
The television tells them their vision
Now it's hard for them to make decisions without feeling
Rule of thumb, you can't be dumb
Well I studied a broad and she studied me back
And my course was hard
That was that, this is this, listen up
'Cause all I'm saying is
If thirty's the new twenty, thirty's the new twenty for them wheels as well
While the girls are steady graduatin'
Nigga's standin' on the corner hatin', debatin'
'Well, should I get the new J's or the Kobe's?'
Huh, I'm a G-entleman, let's get reacquainted
I am Andre Benjamin
I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to play the block like that
I used to carry knots like that
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy, 'cause I’m all grown up, ha
Y'all roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day
Y'all young’uns chase, I’m Patron'n it straight
I like South Beach but I’m in St. Tropez
Y'all drink Dom, but not Rose’
Hey, ya chick shop at the mall
My chick burning down Bergdorf’s
Comin' back with Birkin bags
Your chick is like, 'What type of purse is that?'
I’m from the era where niggas don’t snitch
You from the era where snitchin' is the shit
I’m afraid of the future
Y'all respect the one who got shot, I respect the shooter
Young boys gotta chill, thirty’s the new twenty, nigga, I’m so hot still
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
Yeah, we used to ball like that
Now we own the ball team, holla back
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy, 'cause I’m all grown up, ha
Jay-Z, what can a young motherfucka tell me
About the LAPD, about the air that we breathe
Nothin', nada, zero, zilch
Playground king, climb the monkey bars that I built
Thirty's the new twenty, Phantom's the new Bentley
Nigga, don't tempt me, I'll bury you up in Tempe (Westside)
And if I catch a ghost rider, tie him to a tree, gasoline like the lighter
Burn, you motherfuckin' biter
Treat you like George Bush treat Al-Qaeda
This is Guantanamo, think I'm a hoe
I made the honor roll, mixed with Geronimo (Yay, yay)
Before this mic we'll pass, learn how to wipe your nose before you wipe your ass
Ice Cube, the pyroclastic flow
I used to let my pants sag, not givin’ a fuck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I’m all grown up
Now I got black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy, 'cause I’m all grown up, ha
You're now tuned into the muh'fuckin' greatest (Jigga)
Turn the music up in the headphones (Jigga)
Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off, nigga
I got you, yeah, uhh
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You're now tuned into the mu'fuckin' greatest
Best rapper alive, best rapper alive
The nerve with you herbs
Y'all know who swerve from the curb
In the L-e-x - the best - observe:
Fuck what you heard: splashing, splurging
Champagne glasses crashing, can't ration
Had a buck fifty while you was still taking Skippy to school
Ran with one of them niggas that heists Tiffany's for them jewels
Back when Duke was jumping out of Cap'n Crunch food
I was scheming and plotting
Mostly dreaming a lot but look what it got me
4 cars and 400 thousand shots later, fucked up in gators
You scared to look, niggas is shook
Fuck it, you're vibrators
Bullets rank off the hook when niggas try to violate us
FBI spies hate us, all they gotta check is my
Latest cut then follow my moves: I'm the greatest
Fuck how haters been paying dues
I cheated, committed felonies when needed
While you niggas starve, what's this you're making?
If you was hustling like you said
We would've bumped heads, so I know you niggas is faking
(Good riddance) hol' up!

No, not the Geico, ain't nothing accidental

Half of the shit I've been through

Your mind would open, your heart would bleed
You sound retarded to me!

Won't you throw in the towel, stop running your mouth
Don't you know that we know you're just running your mouth
Cause when this shit pops off, we gonna run in your house
When you're defeated, young punk?
Won't you throw?
Won't you throw in the towel? I'm better with vowels
My vocabulary murders the dictionary
Shit, I'm heavy in the game
I ain't worried 'bout a thing
Last man standing
Blam-blamming the cannon
48 Hours, it's Reggie Hammond
The colte, Nick Nolte
My demeanor is Humphrey Bogie
Baby, I'm comfy, cozy, my spot is solidified
Roc-a-bye baby, I sing you a lullabye
Shit, I carry two Taurus, niggas they call me Gemini
Though my birthday is one day before December 5
Arrows through your apparel, I will dearly depart ya
You nah destroys me nigga; nigga I'm poetry
Check out my melody, my flow is a felony
Oh, I'm so seventies, I'm in tune with the heavenly
Governing body - Check, check, check out my destiny
I walk leaving four footprints
My book smarts
My faith of the unknown
What's seldom shown is the good part
Like I said
Try to bring 'em life, but they want dead
You won't listen
That'll piss him off quick, you won't listen
When you're defeated, young punk?
Won't you throw
Won't you throw in the towel, stop running your mouth
Cause when this shit pops off, we gonna run in your house
Don't you know
When you're defeated, young punk?
Won't you throw?
Won't you throw in the towel? I'm better with vowels
My vocabulary murders the dictionary
Flow switches every 16, shits mean, man

Serena Altschul's here live outside the criminal courthouse
(This is {bullshit} y'all)
In New York City for the first day in the trial of
The State vs. Shawn Carter, a.k.a. Jay-Z
Whatever the verdict in this trial may be
The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide
Ayo, stand forward, 'fore you take notice
Or witness to me killin' the track
Testify 'til me spillin' the smack
Now they got me for traffickin', racketeerin', audio crack
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man
A broke man, approachin' the bench with intent
To bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man
Evidence stemmin' from ninety-six
They say the world ain't recovered from his fix
While they was usin' cut, I was on some other shit
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it
Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised
Listenin' to testimony about my foul ways
Exhibit A: Reasonable Doubt
They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out
You can feel the tension building here
As an unprecedented number of people have turned out
For what may be the trial of the century
They call me dope man, dope man
Ghetto spokes-man
How come, you label your brand of dope
Vol. 1 and spread it through the slums?
Fed it to the young with total disregard
And how could you, turn right around
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise
And do you deny you're responsible for the demise
Of record execs, and do you object?
Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects
Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan
And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen
And we ain't gon' talk about Murder Inc
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link
The State is seeking the maximum penalty
And with the overwhelmin' amount of evidence
The D.A.'s presented, things aren't lookin' good
They call me dope man, dope man
Ghetto spokes-man
The rapper has been known to emerge triumphant
In the face of adversity
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man
Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear
A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance
Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands
But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up
Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up
Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors
Keep us spiralin', goin' backwards
Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line
Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine
Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine
The soul of Mumia in this modern day time
While the jury is inside deliberatin'
They call me dope man, dope man
I try to tell 'em I'm where hope, floats man
Ghetto spokes-man
Well the verdict has just been announced: NOT GUILTY!
It is complete pandemonium out here!
People are cheerin' and huggin' - there he is
Jay-Z is exitin' the courtroom right now
There is a swarm of cameras surroundin' him {*pop bulbs flashing*}
And people are just rushin' up to him
Let's try and make our way over there, Jay-Z! Jay-Z!
{*sounds of cameras keep flashin'*}
"This is the operator with a collect call from: 'Emory Jones'
Emory, whattup?
Told you I ain't too good with writing letters and all
Shit, I don't even write rhymes

Vibe with me...

Cigarette boats, yachts, ain't nowhere we can't go
We in South Beach and the Hamptons, too, baby!
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know, I know
Do you wanna ride with me?
Do you wanna ride with me?
An experiment, we're in it, only as objects
And sidestep cops on the way to the top - yes!
As kids we would daydream, sitting on our steps
Pointing at cars like yeah that's our sex
Hustlers profits made our eyes stretch
So on some Dr. Spock shit, we started our trek
Some of us made it, most of us digressed
We show success, please live through me
(This is a collect call) So every time I press 5
Up in the fed, and still holdin' his head
So when he hits the streets he gon' eat through this bread
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do you wanna ride with me?
Do you wanna ride with me?
I'm crushing all award shows
All that fly shit we talked about
Giving them Sinatra pinky rings with the blue diamonds and everything
Hehehe, that's what we talked about right?
Uh-huh... tried to told you, ride with me
International Hov, I told you so
40/40s out in Tokyo
Singapore, all this from singing songs
Coming up though we thought slinging raw
Was the end-all-be-all of being rich, didn't we?
Little did I know my mo' potent delivery
Would deliver me, kingpin of the ink pen
Monster of the double entendre, Coke is still my sponsor
Hova still getting it in with soda
Diet, no sir, I ain't lose no weight
Started from the crates now I'm sitting on a whole case
Since they got you sitting on that old case
Our dreams is on hold like TiVo
So I can't wait till you get your date
I got some temp plates outside of the gate
We gon' ride
I know, I know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know, I know
Do you wanna ride with me?
Do you wanna ride with me?
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Geah
Don't even worry about it though, you ain't missed nuttin

Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, white paper though nigga
Can't even fuck with those blunts
White paper baby, old school nigga gimme a joint
Smooth it out, Young H.O.
Word to my momma, we livin'!
Yeah
I'm from where dreamin' ain't allowed
Enough to dream your self-esteem into clouds
It takes tears, sweat, blood, 5 CCs
'Cause I know what a kid in apartment 5C see'd
Speed datin' with destiny, I couldn't tell her nope
When I first saw stars, television was my telescope
Threw diamonds in the sky that never came down, now that's a star
My vision was big enough to get me out of the space
I wanted to pass how far I see
For things that are seen are temperal
Roc Nation, indivisible
American dream team
Paper planes turned into the real thing
You are whatever you say you are
Turn any situation around
Who. Are. You?
Spin around ma
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Spin around mommy
Drop, drop, like it's hot
I got the rollie on my arm
And I'm pourin saun dan
And I roll the best weed
Cause I got it goin on
Chef boy-ar-P is back in the kitchen
You niggas is scratchin, my niggas is itchen
Don't keep "Pacin" but these dudes blow they "Pistons"
None of y'all is fuckin with he, and this is obvious
While my niggas in the street pushin shit like Ben Wallace
And any ya'll could get it, even fans in the stands
Everything is grand? Nothing is poquito
Securitys behind me, with the torpedo
Cause the wrist stay frigid
How you say it? Frio
And the ends also quarter million for each whe-el
I got haters on my jiz-ock, plus the fricking ciz-ops
All of whom want to hit me with shiz-ots til I dri-zop
Thank God for hip hop, or I be in the bizz-ox, uh
But now I'm so fresh you could smell me through a ziplock
Mr S. D-izz-ot, it's not gon' stizz-op
Too much pizzazz for these piss-ass niggas to get past
Too cool for ciz-ops to cuff his iz-ass
These niggas giving out cases like a liquor store
All the money it made, I'm like "Forget the law"
I'm not 'fr-iz-aid, it J-iz-ay homie you got pl-iz-ayed
Take it like a man, the flow ran you off the stiz-age (go sit down)
Wastin' ya time tryin' to sue S. Dot, tell ya lawyer
"Take that civil case and drop it like it's hot!"
((World Wide))
International, nah I'm universal
But you a gangsta, how you get to do commertials?
With them big wheels, yeah cuz you do it big
I never fake the funk, niggas know I ain't no punk
They want beef? Yeah cuz, pop the trunk
We go all the way, we do it lifesize
Now my life right, cause my wife on my right side
Yeah, and she protecting my interest
A pimp apprentice
Now come here princess (Come here, come here)
It really don't matta it's like a seesaw platter
I check money, check niggas, check bitches
E
Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?
Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
“Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!”
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns 'cause I wasn't present
Your body wouldn't accept it
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over, what if you over my shit?
I'm never gonna treat you
Ohhhhhh
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
"You did what with who?"
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
"You risked that for Blue?"
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away and Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
Let's try this, Guru
(Every time I think about you) yeah yeah
(I feel so alive)
(I wish I could hold onto you forever)
This is how I start my day anew
Uhh, uh huh, uh huh, yeah, uhh
(I woke up early this morning with a new sight over life)
Good morning America, ghetto USA
(Never read the Qur'an or Islamic scriptures
Only Psalms I read was on the arms of my niggas)
Uhh, come on, good morning
(The sunshine was shining, you were on my mind)
Yeah, I wake up, hit my shoebox, I snatch out a few rocks
Put the rest inside, now I'm ready to ride
Put the bomb in my socks so cops can't locate the vials
I ain't freshly dressed but got a Colgate smile
That's right, hah
(I woke up early this morning)
I got loads of capers to come up with this paper
Hit the block like a veteran
Fiends need they medicine, I'm the relief pitcher
Their clean up hitters, it works
I hit the Ave., stash the bag in the dirt
Put the rest in my small pocket, I start clockin'
(I woke up early this morning)
Same routine: I'm runnin' game to fiends
Exchangin' cash for crack rocks, back and forth to my stash box
Hundred dollars a week
Shorties got the Ave. watched, fiends swarm
I'm gettin' rid of this bomb, as I
(I woke up early this morning with a new sight over life)
(Never read the Qur'an or Islamic scriptures
(The sun was shinin', you were on my mind)
(I woke up early this morning...)
Yeah
Yeah
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from
Concrete jungle (yeah) where dreams are made of
There's nothin' you can't do (yeah) (okay)
Now you're in New York (aha, aha, aha) (uh, yeah)

You should know I bleed Blue, but I ain't a Crip, though
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
For foreigners it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed "I Got It Made"
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice Cee Lo, three card Monte
Labor Day Parade – rest in peace, Bob Marley
Long live the king, yo – I'm from the Empire State, that's

Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
And when winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

I used to cop in Harlem – hola, my Dominicanos
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie

And when winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
The city of sin is a pity on a whim

Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?
(*Sighs*) Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore
Owww, it's star time
This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to stage

I can get you BET – and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All ‘cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change
Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip
(What the hell are you waiting forrrr?)
You gotta, you gotta well, ya gotta light a J
You gotta puff a J on this one [inhales]

So hot to trot, lady!
Excuse me miss, what's your name?

Possibly, can I take you out, tonight?
You already know what it's hittin' for
50/50 venture with them S Dots kickin' off
Armadale poppin' now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin' is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST
Who else you gon' run with? The truth is us
Only dudes movin' units - Em, Pimp Juice and us
It's the Roc in here!
Maybach outside, got rocks in ears
I don't land at an airport, I call it the clearport
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more

Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!
Sex-cuse me, damn!
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one
You're so contagious, I can't take it

No prescription, you could prescribe to subside, his affliction
You can't rain dance on his picnic
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens can dead his sickness
No Ouija board, you can't see me dog, nigga you CB-4
This ain't Chris Rock bitch, it's the R.O.C. bitch
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket, Yao Ming!
Still smokin that la-la-la
Memph' Bleek still smokin that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five

But I got a plan B that's planned out, for when things don't pan out
So you take the Destiny Child girl in the Coupe?
Then I'mma try bag the ones that got kicked out the group
I figured that'll be simple, I'll just help 'em with their demo
Help 'em to the limo, play the upboard instrumentals
And she - grabbed my tattoo, peeped my credentials
And she - grabbed my pants, felt the potential
And I - rubbed 'bout every essential
Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millenium
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney
And Rémy and weed, 'til she higher than helium

Women start to fall we all bat around

Keep ya arm over ya face my nigga (keep ya head)
Keep a mind to survive if ya sleep ya dead
Stay fly 'til ya die nigga deep with prayer
With each word ya say I guess the beef is dead
Ladies & gentlemen (like impeach the Prez)
Val Kilmer style nigga draw heat with Feds
Broad day like De Niro shoot all day
Get a hit I, I come through, blow up, you spit out
With one in the drop don't get hit up
Meet me in the square with one in the chamber

Yeah!
This goes out (to my Brooklyn crew)
I know I should've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm... (fallin')
When I get to one brick, then the game I would depart with
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like:
Got to two bricks, new cars, new whips
But niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip
Brand new convertibles, I'm so ruthless
Front row fight night, see how big my tube is
Fuck HD, nigga, see how clear my view is?
But there's a price for overdoing it
Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back
I know I should've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable (now ya) fallin'
When you should've fell back
Now you (fallin'), right into they lap
Fallin', they applauding, they screaming at the screen
Damn, you fucked up like your favorite movie scene
Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino
You seen what that last run did to De Niro in Heat
Can't beat the odds, can't cheat the Gods
Can't blow too hard, life's a deck of cards
Under your breath like you knew this day was coming (fallin')
Now let's pray that arm candy
That you left your ex for stay down and come in handy
'Cause come January it gets cold, when the letters start to slow
And your commissary's low and lawyers screams appeal
Only thinking about a bill and your chances are nil
Damn, gravity's ill...
I know I should've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable (but ya) fallin'
And you can't get up
All you do is push-up, pull-up, sit-up
Locked down the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there
And your arm candy sweet on 'em
And the women that you left for this heifer
Got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps coming, hard to keep something on your stomach
You're sick about what your life is becoming (fallin')
But your use-to's, has-beens, ragging bad about all the new dudes
Talking tough on the YouTube 'bout what you used to do
But that's old school to the new crew
They doing numbers like Sudoku
They'll experience déja vu too
Run and you'll never escape, so just fall from grace
Damn...
I know I should've did that
I know it's gon' come right back
I know it's gon' destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get ya boy sent away
But this game I play, ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
Fallin', seems like I'm fallin'
(Ha-ya, ha-ya)
That's how he feel, turn my vocal up (Ha-ya)
Turn my vocal up some more
Turn my vocal up, Guru! (Ha-ya)
My wife in the crib feedin' the kids liquid gold
We in a whole different mode
I cooked up more chicken when the kitchen closed
Uh, we gon' reach a billi' first
Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all
Hovi's home, all these phonies come to a halt
All this old talk left me confused
You'd rather be old rich me or new you?
Like 2Pac ain't have a nose ring too, huh
Nobody wins when the family feuds
But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit
I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?
Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute
(Mmmmm) Pretty much
If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us
Fuck rap, crack cocaine
Hundred percent Black-owned champagne
And we merrily merrily eatin' off these streams
Y'all still drinkin' Perrier-Jouët, hah
But we ain't get through to you yet, uh
'Specially if they're from the same hue as you
Y'all stop me when I stop tellin' the truth
Hahahaha (Ha-ya)
I would say I'm the realest nigga rappin' (Ha-ya)
That's like sayin' I'm the tallest midget (Ha-ya)
Can I get "Amen" from the congregation?
Amen, amen (Ha-ya)
Can I get a "Amen" from the congregation?
Amen, amen (Ha-ya)
Ha-ya-ya-ya
Yeah, I'll fuck up a good thing if you let me
A man that don't take care his family can't be rich
I'll watch Godfather, I miss that whole shit
My consciousness was Michael's common sense
I missed the karma that came as a consequence
Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin'
Kay losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain
Nobody wins when the family feuds
We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools
I'm tryna fix you
I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official
Y'all think small, I think Biggie
Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi
Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies
How is him or Pill Cosby s'posed to help me?
Old niggas never accepted me
New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis
We all lose when the family feuds
What's better than one billionaire? Two
Hahahah
I'll be damned if I drink some Belvedere while Puff got CÎROC
Y'all need to stop
(Ha-ya) Ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya
(Ha-ya) Ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya
Ha-ya-ya-ya
Ha-ya, ha-ya
Love me like, love
Like.... yeah, yeah, yeah

Ha ha, ha ha
What.. '96 and forever
Rok-A-Blok, Roc-A-Fella
Yeah, keep it realer than most
Marcy, Brooklyn... yeah
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die
But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it
Jiggy-Jigga looking gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talking 'bout large money, what's the point?
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
Even if it ain't sunny, hey, I ain't complaining
(Where you disappear to, son?) Maintaining
I'm living, the ill streets' blues got you hunger pang-in'
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, you still singing, fool
I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit
And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers can't really know I'm loving it, you feeling it?
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
Y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
I get to zoning: me and this chick on the island and then we're boning
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man
It got me going, shit
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët...
Can I kick it? (Yes you can)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can)
(I'm kinda lovin' that)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can)
WELL I'M GONE!
Debut's a classic, first album, four mics
Should've got a five, but niggas lack foresight
But I don't give a fuck, I ain't do it for the hype
For the struggle for those who bubble white
For fly 4X4s, roofless cars, flawless ice
For every time it rains 40 days and 40 nights
For every promise made that never saw the light
I'll get my own forty acres, give me four nights
Four O's, a Glock 40 for the jackers and I'm Spike
Or the four-four will suffice
A fourteen-year-old to look out for the vice
You can sit back and just wait for the flight
Your boy'll take off like I've been strippin' all my life
That's the type of metaphors I write
To let niggas know I was real before the mic
Four front rows, had the fur at the fight
No PETA on my Peter, left some room for the divas
In the suite, we'll meet up if ya wild for the night
On a rampage, champagne pours, on the floor
For all those who ain't make it here and lost they life
Not for no hoes, not for no ice
Not for no fame nor for bright lights
44 four's, muh'fucka, I'm NICE
Check
Here I am
The man
I'm swinging and singing and bringing
The light to the mic
Again
Together forever
Endeavour, to always prevail
Well
I'm better
In comparison
Jay-Z's embarrassing
Your time after
Riggity-rhyme master
The liggity-last Jay-Z rhyme
So pro fade line
You got starch in your flow
I flow too many ways
Got an arch in my flow
All songs are flow
Rembrandt, Rilke
You gotta pardon the flow
Niggas takin' me lightly
Had to darken the flow
Way I put it together
Tear 'em apart with the flow
I'm too smart with the flow
You just started to flow
Stop it youngin'
You 106 & Park with the flow
Three Million
Four
I am the used spirit
I am y'all with the flow
Troubled man, dare I say
I am all with the flow
But I evolve with the flow
Crossover, slam dunk
Rucker Park with the flow
Young!
Old school, new school need to know this I burn like
Left Eye Lisa Lopez, burn slow like blunts of hydro
Jigga Man, BK shit, y'all know
Jigga Man, ya heard, the fugitive allow me to spit on this Clue shit
Allow me to thank the people for all of their support and your prayers
And all the people that prejudge me, fuck you, suck my dick
D.A. act like a nigga starvin' for Jay if they lock me in a cage
Fuck it, party away I'm still hot, I'm still S dot y'all
Still got Millions buried in the sock drawer
Still holdin' my own on the corner nigga
What can't kill me can only make me stronger nigga
And when I get back home get your ass up out the throne
It's just goin' back to the way shit was
I'ma stay hot no matter what my shit does
I could drop a straight dud, I'ma stay up niggas tryin' to break my will
You know that ain't my steel I'm Destiny's Child, my fate's been sealed
You're dealin' with a higher power I'm like Dwight Eisenhower
As my world turns like the wheels on a bicycle spoke
All they see is money, they want me to blind the jury
Is the sun shines clearly
Now everybody wanna rhyme like Hov' 'cause I rhyme
Like I be rhymin' in the Rov' climbin' in them hoes
My minds like the diamonds, I'll blind you at them shows
I don't shine, I glow, I remind you of that dough don't I?
Murder niggas won't I?
My persona, hustler turned rapper, smell the crack aroma
Send shots like toma in any language
Leave niggas in a coma when I'm bangin' that Fifth
Get chicks lit off Coronas and bamboo spliffs
And get the camcorder to cam cord their hand movements
And for what? Y'all actin' like y'all better than Hov'
Y'all niggas should open up for the Letterman show
Niggas is funny, all I do is get money
And y'all niggas sound funny to me everybody's rappin'
Like they better than Hov' but thats shits real funny to me
Look around at all the platinum, proof is proof
But I'ma let niggas live 'cause it's beautiful
Live niggas
Jigga Man ya heard? Clue Duro
When Im Alone In My Room Sometimes I Stare At The Wall
But In The Back Of My Mine I Hear my conscience Call
Telling Me I Need A Girl Who's As Sweet As A Dove
So If You Stuck Off Love i Suggest You Get Over It
Ma Cry Me A River Build A Bridge And Get Over It
They Love It When Im Hard On Hoes
I Agree My Lady Ain´t No Bitch She Get Whatever I Own
So When You See Understand Thats Me Nigga
Understand Im still the same OG Nigga
*NO LYRICS YET
Shit, you know what to do
Primo, Cold Crush when I give it to you
Friend or foe, yo, state your biz
Ummm, you tendin' dough? Ah, there it is
Me, I run the show, oh, and these kids don't like nobody comin' around here fuckin' with they dough for shit
But fuck with the big dogs, yo, I gotta bite ya
Look, it's out of my hands
And you gettin' money 'round here, it's not in the plans
So hop yo' ass out of that van, head back to Kansas
I'm sendin' niggas back up in campuses
Chance is slimmer than that chick in Calvin Klein pants is
Let me guess, they said it was money 'round here
And the rest is me stoppin' you from gettin' it, correct?
Sorry to hear that, my guess is you got work at the hotel
I'll take care of that, you'll soon see
You're twitchin', don't do that, you makin' me nervous
My crew, well, they do pack, them dudes is murderers
So please, would you put your hand back in sight?
They don't like to see me nervous, you can understand that, right?
You draw, better be Picasso—you know, the best
'Cause if this is not so, ah, God bless
You leave me no choice, I'll leave you no voice
Believe you me, son
Now calm your boys
'Cause I'm findin' it a little hard to concentrate with all the noise
Get the point, I'll let you go; before you leave
And a promise you never, no matter the weather
Ever ever ever ever ever ever come around here no mo', ha haha
Uh-huh uh, the saga continues...
Motion picture shit
Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air, one woke him
Son soaking, sweating in his bed like dun' loc'in!
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a Vulcan
He finally realized who was the culprit
I said yeah, remember me from Friend or Foe when
I told you don't ever ever come around here no more
Time to pay now, you try to rise, I wave the gun - lay down
I try to talk sensibly, hoping that eventually you realize
I had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be
Plus I had sympathy when we all bought rims with your keys
And it was an afterthought that maybe you'll try to avenge me
But I was like "Nah", Homes had to know he was wrong
And if you caught me on the foul now you sing me the same song
Plus you promised
And that's really no fun
And here I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns
And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
Peep how my eyes just scour the room
I'm alert, plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out
You think you the first nigga I played out, in a two-hotel town?
Come on now, I peeped your Lexus as you
Money well invested, rudely interrupted
Jamaican accent (Boy you know who you dun fucked with?)
A gun in your face and that's all you can come up with?
And please yo, tell BIG, he's unbelievable
Friend or foe BIOTCH!

"A little over a year ago I was in bondage. And now I'm back out here, reaping the blessings, and getting the benefits that go along with it. Everything that's out here for kings like us. The reason why we like this—this jewelry and this diamonds and stuff—they don't understand, it's because we really from Africa. And that's where all this stuff come from. And we originated from kings, you know what I'm saying? So don't look down on the youngsters because they wanna have shiny things. It's in our genes, know what I'm saying? We just don't all know our history, so…"

8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs
People said I would amount to nothin'
That I had talent for nothin'
Said I would succumb to violence or be silenced by a gunman
Wanting somethin', claiming that they done somethin' for him
Got their Jay Z pom poms and their Hov uniform
And tellin' everybody, like Martin Lawrence
'Bout how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was
Claiming that they threw it up before I threw it up
You what? Where was you before I blew this up?
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everybody was suin' us
Back on the block, getting it in, there wasn't no you with us
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs
6 miles and runnin' in the Pontiac six thousand eighty six
Trans might shift while the engine run
Anyone tell your honor: "Give me one more chance."
So I'ma bring 'em one
Only son to my pop, stick close to my mama
My son growin' and he learnin' a lot
That's when them toasters, when the burners will pop
Brain on your, um–brella, a nigga, tell 'em niggas
That's like the Biblical scripture
Most of your heartless and self-centered
Like Meshach and Mesha
The heat back, like you never left
Six miles and runnin', dodgin' every trap
The rap gingerbread man
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs
Back when nobody would find he had talent
Nobody would sign me
Nobody believed in me, nobody but Mommy blindly
But how can she deny me? Me being the youngest runt
Revenge is sweet honey, we run this
Beans and Bleek is right now, we can see y'all 8 miles, nigga
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs
8 miles and runnin', got my seventh album droppin'
And my eighth album comin'
Feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free!
6 miles and runnin', got my fifth strip poppin'
And my first album comin', feeding twenty growling stomachs
Just let me be great
I feel like mothafuckin' Cassius Clay right now
Genius!
Don't be good my nigga, be great
After that government cheese, we eating steak
I'm from the bottom, I know you can relate
Fuck up the world
Just fuck up this world
Fuck up the world
Me and destiny got a date
Martin had a dream, Hov got a team
My chain already heavy, don't let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush, Confetti on my fur
Turn right in Red Hook, niggas heavy on the curb
See most my niggas died early twenties or late teens
Still they wanna act like it's an everyday thing, clean
Fuck up this world
Fuck up the, uhh
High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
Came through Pasadena in the low-low
Just to show respect to the cholos
I just want a shot to show my genius
Standing on the top hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murder Malcolm, gave Cassius the shakes
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble
You know I'm gon' shine like a trillion watts
Sendin' light out to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil bastard boy, basking on top
I fuck up this world
Just fuck up this world
Let's fuck up the world
Fuck up the, uhh
He in a Cadillac; me? I'm in the Maybach
This ain't grey sweat suits and white tube socks
This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
Got stripclubs feeling like Oxford, I swear
Teacher-teacher, I'm trying to unteach ya
All the shit they taught y'all, they got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game, those the Spike Lees
You front row everywhere, you in the H.O.V.'s
Jordan 1's and dungarees
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million
We have yet to see a ceiling, we just top what we top
Cause the bars don't struggle and the struggle don't stop
Just fuck up this world
Uh
Y'all wanna take my life, then come and get it
I'm so committed to street life, sometimes I don't sleep nights
Back up and live, cause the fact of this is
I keep .44s in the sky, mind on my money
Nigga, I'm so for real, I hope you're not finding this funny, nah
Live everyday like my last, fast money
But pop's dick, mom's egg, hungry like a hostage
With every step that I take I use my hood sense
Study my footprints, learn from my mistakes
I was born dead, baby, my life is all gravy
Reporting live from the ROC, I rep for my set
Till the date of my death, I will die for my block
I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
Get off my ass and get about that cash
Live everyday like my last, like death's approaching fast
Gotta get my shit off (shit off! get off, get off)
Get off my ass and get about my cash
Gotta get my shit off (shit off! shit off! shit off!)
Live everyday like my last...
If there was heaven above us, I was living in hell
My neighborhood was the roughest, I never complained
Bush and Reagan couldn't stop me from makin'
I wish I could dream about being a lawyer
But I had dealers in my hallway, death around the corner
Couldn't tell right from wrong, pimps will spoil you
Give you dollars for errands when nobody was carin'
I got to get my shit off, it rang true every time
I heard it or every time somebody got murdered
We pour liquor on the curb until the cement stain
I cried enough tears from my eyes to equal 3-inch rain
Motherfuckers, I deserve it when I be in the Range
I copped them uncut stones that be freezing the chain
I done been through enough shit to make you pee in your pants
Man, I'm sorry if we ain't seeing the same, I seen it rain
I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
Get off my ass and get about that cash
I gotta get my shit off (get off, get off)
Gotta get my shit off (shit off! get off, get off)
Get off my ass and get about my cash
Live everyday like my last...
That's why I give you my up and downs, my pain, my passion, my pleasure
My good and bad times, niggas, my whatever
My hopes and dreams, blood, tears and sweat
My version of R. Kelly, this is a nigga's threat
My life is an open book, nigga, I hope you took from it
Whatever works for you, I was put on this earth to move
But I've been smoking a lot lately, not counting my drinks
I got to get my shit off, for that I'm certain
Nigga, I'm clear, I done seen my cupboards bare
Heard money mentioned in my mother's prayer
Had nights my stomach filled up with nothing but air
Got 10 dollars to eat for 4 of us to share
That's why Hov' act like that, quick to snap
MAC-11 ready, I ain't going back
Gotta get my shit off (shit off! get off, get off)
Get off my ass and get about my cash
Gotta get my shit off (shit off! shit off! shit off!)
Sup ma? You want to roll with us, y'knowhatI'msayin'?

We gon' really get to know one another
Knahmean? I'm here for you, yo
Relax yourself, let your conscience be free
You now rollin' with them thugs from the R-O-C
Cross over to the Roc, make yourself hot
The topic of discussion in every nail shop
It's a secret society, all we ask is trust
And within a week, watch your arm freeze up
Brassiere get right, A to a D cup
Weave get tight, pedicure your feet up
From hoodrat to superstar, there's your life
Fuck with Hova, he can take you out of your hell
Say bye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel
Say hi to Gucci, Prada as well
Take a look in the mirror, be proud of yourself
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
You gotta play your part when you're rollin' with the R-O-C
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
Get your mind right mami, get your mind right

Get your mind right mami, get your mind right
And I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family
Yo, I'm young Memphis, used to play the apprentice
Now I'm like the teacher, c'mere, let me teach ya
How to play them benches, hold this work in your dentures
How to play it cool when police come to pinch us
Teach you how to keep your nose up out of my shit
When the beeper goes off, please don't reach
Like you put a ring or spend cheese on Bleek
When I'm in the shower, *69 me crazy
Track my last call, contact my broad
With a bitch or two, had physical contact in the mall
You got issues {*inhales*} problems you need to iron out
You gotta play your part when you're rollin' with the R-O-C

Believe me when I tell you girl I know you a freak
Just put your mind to it you can go real far
I know times gettin' hard on the boulevard
They say, pimpin' is dead (What?), man, pimpin' ain't dead
These hoes just scared and they blind tryin' and dyin' to be led (Mm)
But who's to lead 'em? Talk shit to 'em and beat 'em
Get they mind right and feed 'em
Now I don't need 'em (Uh-uh), but I can do that there
Put on a three-piece suit and Shirley Temple my hair
So I can, feel like a player when I walk in the place (Place)
Got yo' bitch all on my line, and now she up in my face
Is this yo' bitch? Is that yo' bitch? 'Cause if she's not, she mine
She falling for a nigga and I ain't even dropped a line
Get out my limelight bitch, and get your mind right

C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name
I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters
Busters they wanted to rush us
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right
You can light up the whole room, turning day from night
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down (that's right)
It took short sleeves and lounging to understand
The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze
Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you
And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you
The direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do
I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools
Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you
So I devoted half my time to invest in you
The other half was spent on protecting you
'Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me
C'mon
C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Hold me tight and call me your lady (say it louder)
Make me scream your name
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name
I'm often with you, so they wonder 'bout the juice I got
I took you from the projects and an abusive pops
From the bottom to the top
The skateboard to the drop
I got ya like I got ya
From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya
It was then I knew everywhere I went you'd follow
Soon I spent every dollar, you became my habit
The more checks I got the more I laced my crew
Tricked a little bit, shit I lace my boo
Fuck it, my mistress I laced her too
Cop my jewels twice, like déjà vu
If they ever met in the mall, it was over y'all
Just the way I do, and either way you win
I mean the thugs love ya when you're girl's best friend
C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name
Yeah, yeah, yeah
In the wedding band you love, in the gold chain you thug
And the tennis bracelet means they want relations
Know that they wanna fuck, the only reason they give you up
In the hands of gold diggers you never enough
Rings, things, just never enough
I mean the thugs love ya, but ya girl's best friend
C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy
Don't want nobody but you my baby
C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy (where all my baby thugs?)
Don't want nobody but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Make me scream your name
C'mon here baby, you drive me crazy
Don't want nobody but you my baby
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name

Tend to hurries in ten places at once
Plus she can't front, 'cause peep how I run mines
Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
Our time apart is our time apart
So love Jay with your mind girl and not your heart

Claim he love you, it's no doubt, it's Gwen Stef-phony

A Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia
It be going in and out thats why I barely hear ya
I be goin' in and out just like a robberia
I’m tryna take this money like Rob and G-dep
Then i'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina
And my dick so big it can't fit in my jeans
And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream
And it get so bad she wanna tear up my things
But still, K-A-N-Y-E
She say she wanna go on a shopping spree
Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans 'cuz the ass was free
I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie, and the girls respect me for it
Ain't gonna say my nose? can't be over
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from
I'm tryin girls out, waiting patiently
Just tryin girls out, until I find the one for me
The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe the feeling, for real
Baby, I paint the sky blue
False alarms and false starts
All made better by the sound of your heart
All the pain of the last time
I prayed so hard it was the last time
Your mama said that you danced for her
Did you wiggle your hands for her?
Glory! Glory!
Glory! Sorry
Everything that I prayed for
God's gift, I wish I woulda prayed more
God makes no mistakes, I made a few
Rough sledding here and there, but I made it through
I wreak havoc on the world
Get ready for part two
A younger, smarter, faster me
So a pinch of Hov, a whole glass of Bey
The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe the feeling, for real
Baby, I paint the sky blue
Your Grandpop died of nigga failure
Deep down he was a good man
Goddamn, I can't deliver failure
Wicked-ass lil B
Hard not to spoil you rotten, looking like little me
The most beautifulest thing in this world
Is daddy's little girl
And Mama woke up the next day and shot her album package
Last time the miscarriage was so tragic
We was afraid you'd disappear, but nah, baby, you magic (Voilà!)
So there you have it, shit happens
Just make sure the plane you on is bigger than your carry-on baggage
Life is a gift, love, open it up
You're the child of my destiny
You're my child with the child from Destiny's Child
That's a hell of a recipe
Glory! Glory!
The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe the feeling, for real
Baby, I paint the sky blue
*baby noises*
I been crushing the building since Izod socks
I might not stop
Places to cop, seventy-six floors, you can call me the Doc|
Say when, say when
(When!)
Inspired by Basquiat, my chariot's on fire
Everybody took shots, hit my body up, I'm tired
Build me up, break me down to build me up again
They like: "Hov, we need you back so we can kill your ass again"
How I'm 'posed to win, they got me fightin' ghosts
Same sword they knight you they gon' good night you with
Sh.., Thats' only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
You see Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas; see Caesar, see Brutus
See success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed, prepare to be crucified
Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you ghetto
So it's tough bein' Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you gotta be Bobby now
Now the question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having at [all]
Everybody wanna be the King then shots ring
You layin' on your balcony with holes in your dream
Everybody get your hand off my jeans
Uhh! Like you work that hard to stay the same
Uhh! Game stays the same, the name changes
Most kings get driven so insane
That they try to hit the same vein that Kurt Cobain did
No dangers, so shameless
Invited to the inner sanctum of your chambers
Low chain 'em as the enemies approach
And the Spirit I'm evoking
Hold on
Everybody screaming they want the old Hov
But the new improved Hov hit like Albert Pujols
Everybody wanna hear me talk that money like Phil Rizzuto
But my mind is on Pluto
Trying to find some loopholes in the IRS
As where I used to have a few hoes I am just
Concentrating on making a new Hov through sex
I've awakened just in time to school those putos
Trying to follow in my shoes with jewels froze
Better adhere to this text 'fore you go
Broke, spending more than you've accrued on silly baguettes
I know silly begets silly you'll learn on your own
At least my conscience is clear, I'm no longer steering you wrong
I'm getting courted by the bosses
Jimmy I's and Lyors-es -- it's
Gotta be more than the choruses
They respecting my mind now
Just a matter of time now
Operation: Takeover Corporate
Makeover offices-es-es then takeover all of it
Please may these words be recorded
To serve as testimony that I saw it all before it
Came to fruition, sort of a premonition
Uncontrollable hustler's ambition
Alias Superstition, like Stevie
The writing's on the wall like my lady, right baby?
Like a fox, I'm cagey, ah-ah
The more successful, the more stressful
The more and more I transform to Gordon Gekko
In the race to a billion got my face to the ceiling
Got my knees on the floor please Lord forgive him
Has he lost his religion, is the greed gon' get him?
He's having heaven on earth, will his wings still fit him?
I got the Forbes on my living room floor
And I'm still talking to the poor, nigga I want more
TIME's most influential, was impressive
'Specially since I wasn't in the artist section
Had me with the builders and the titans
Had me right with Rupert Murdoch
Billionaire boys and some dudes you never heard of
Word up on Madison Ave is I'm a cash cow
Word down on Wall Street, homie, you get the cash out
IPO Hov, no need for reverse merger
Boardroom I'm lifting ya skirt up
Bootleggers, bombing, Bin Laden
I'm still crackin'
I will not lose, I simply refuse
I show power
Devote hours
I live in the struggle, I'm addicted to the hustle
America, this land of mine
Is filled with prisoners, with the same plans as mine
So I'm a walking contradiction
On one hand I love my position
But easily I could have been in that prison
And no, I am not a Christian, though I believe in God
But I don't believe in the devil, my beliefs are odd
How could He give the people freewill, without giving you E-vil?
We will hold it together, believe in the Roc
Long after you leave the spot
Long after my breathing stops
My spirit remains vibrant, I will lead the flock
And that's the tip of the iceberg
You might hear Christ's words in my scriptures
But I only write it for my niggas
As soon as I grab it, I eat it up like a savage
And no one don't have it, I get it together like a marriage
I see you know rappers, I'm on my Ps and Qs and carrots
Y'all don't understand well goddamn, don't y'all know my status?
No need to explain, my name the only thing that matters
When suckers who bite me, they find I'm a bit much to swallow
You're thinkin' it's hollow, the rhythm is rough and r-rugged to follow
It hit you like bam biggity bam bam biggity bam
The kid is a wizard, I'm definitely destined to make 8 digits
Met up with G Rap on the road to riches
As soon as I step up, will never remember
Whatever I touch, whatever I touch you know I'm gonna injure
So wiggle away, hey, you gotta dig that nigga Jay
I'm the greatest MC, I'm the greatest MC in the world
I be thorough in every borough, my name be ringin'
With drug slingin' and doin' my thing and fuck that
Boot-knockin' so lady be jockin', my money be flippin'
I see you peekin' when I'm freakin', nigga stop rippin'

Who's that? With a tip of the melodramatic the crew's back

Don't even try that shit

So what it was said about a brotha bein' as nice as me
Y'all know that shit is dead, right? That shit is dead

I thought this was America people!
Uhh, yeah, guilty until proven innocent huh?
That's how we working huh? Okay
Before me there was many; after me there will be none
I am the one
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playing
Yeah, I get it down, anxiously the public can't wait
Niggas had to have it way before it's release date
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it crunk when I get in the state of mind
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental Rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggas upsetting my mama
Arrested, put in the lineup, trying to put dents in my armor
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
I ain't trying to collide with folk
But I don't want folk taking Jigga for joke
I guess you niggas just woke - good morning!
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. what y'all want from me?
I'm not guilty
I see how you coming at me now, I'm cool
I'm not the snitch, I don't go to the cops to get rich
.. I go to the block and pitch
I go with the Glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick
Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils
If I'm your rival, why would I have to do you?
Press try to throw dirt on my name, disturbing my game
Got big money, big lawyers to fight it
Just like Cochran, cocksuckers you never see me boxed in
Y'all all know it, Jigga's a fighter
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. (uhh, I am the one)
Uhh, okay, you on my radar, I got you too bitch
Got lame bitches trying to fuck with my case
Same lame bitch I bust in her face
Honey just mad I got her fucking replaced
Plus a birthday pass without me even touching my safe
But I ain't gon' lie, the head was sick
But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a better bitch
You heard the rhetoric: "Jigga hit me over the head
With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?"
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I got one or two of those, nothin gon' change
For nothing else, you gotta live with yourself
Try and lie on Hov' 'cause I ride on the road
In what, most would describe as a Rolls
NO, that's that Continental T
The only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
And you wanna charge me, when I'm not guilty
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. what you want from me?
Not guilty
Uhh, uhh, uhh, I, am, the, one
(Y'all, cats, can't touch me)
So you can't touch me nigga, you can't touch me
Said Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
And I got, all my, mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
I don't, know why, y'all can't see that
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I got, all my, mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
So tell me, what you, want from me
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
Y'all, niggas, can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
And I got, all my, mamis
So tell me, what you, want from me
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Y'all, cats, can't touch me
Yeah it's magic
Uhh, Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz
And it's a Heavy D production you bastards
Ha (It's the rock) yeah yo
Let's go
Let's go
Post Positano, Hov' hanging with Bono
U2 can live like Salvatore Ferragamo
And you, too, can cool out poolside at the Delano
'Cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from McDonald's
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple, ya know
And who knew dude that played ball for the NBA
Would make a mistake on the who knew estates, throw it away
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today
Now here's something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action
They say when you play with skills, good luck could happen
Let's go
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
Let's rock
Things got too hot so I jumped off in this rap shit
Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions
Of one individual, he's criminally attached
By dating all the models and actresses
I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio
Through rapping and whatever's happening
Rocawear, I'm the young black Ralph Lauren
The Michael Corleone of the microphone
The Michelangelo of flow, I paint pictures with poems
I gather no moss like a rolling stone
In case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone c'mon
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) Let's rock (c'mon)
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Just like life, Guns and Roses
Visibly shook of the invisible bully (let's go)
Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain
In order to experience joy you need pain
Every time a baby is born, somebody's slain
You know the saying, somebody's lose is another's gain
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
Even a garbage can gets a steak
But when it turns your way before it turns away
Gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay
You'll get return in your investment if attention you pay, let's go
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) It's the Roc
(C'mon) That's right (c'mon)
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes is
Some get left behind and some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses
Take the bass line out
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it bump though
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, "Still, y'all don't know me."
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
Bounce
Left and right
Come on
Uh
Uh
Uhuh
Sing now!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us!
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
From standing on the corners boppin'
To driving some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For dropping some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock fleeing the murder scene
You know me well...
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all know me to fail? Nuh uh
Where all my brother with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mama rub on your hips, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, y'all Volume 2, y'all niggas get ready
Sing!
It's the hard knock life for us!
(I can't hear y'all)
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
And I made myself so easy to love
How much they hate it? very!
Kiss girls like Katy Perry
I am never sprung, but I Spring 'er, Jerry
King like T.I., but in the Chi, Larry...
Both are American Gangsters
You choose who's colder
Rappers get nasty in the booth but I'm grosser
More realer 'cause I'm closer
Had girlies in girdles weighing more than they supposed to
Poser, no sir
My hustle, so Russell
I stretch work, yoga
Al Roker, I used to knock pounds off
It ain’t nothing for me to knock nouns off
At these MCs praying for my downfall
They just haters
I wave at you, I’m so player
I’ll never be done, I’m so ra-re
We killing the game, it's not fair
You muh'fuckers stay right there
'Cause we too high up in the air
We blasting off just like a laser
Nigga, pee-une, pee-une, pee-une
Get back, gimme room room room
DB9 like vroom, vroom, vroom
Young Hov', what we doin', doin', doin'?
We ballin', bitches
Eating y'all food, leaving dishes
Why these niggas always talking Lear talk, 'Ye?
Why I never see 'em at the Clearport, 'Ye?
Why always hear they at the airport?
While I fly daily like I'm in the Air Force?
Therefore, please stop talking my ears off
Millionaire talk
You haters, you mad at me 'cause your paper
Need to get its motherfucking weight up
Hold up, wait up, I ain’t done
It hurts when you say that I ain't the one
You haters, how do I gain your favor?
I need to know 'cause I care
I need you to love me, I swear, look here!
See 'Ye is running the Chi like Gale Sayers
I got the mayor on my pager
I need you, stay there, I breathe you like air
Yeah-yuh, yeah-yeah-yeah yeah-yuh
First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov
What's up? You niggas all fed up ‘cause I got a little cheddar

"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems" – gotta move carefully
‘Cause faggots hate when you gettin' money like athletes
Youngins ice-grillin' me — oh, you not feelin' me?

Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs
Damn, little mans, I'm just tryin' do me

Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage

Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
I know you waitin' in the wing, but I'm doin' my thing
Where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of the city

Now, I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar
Look, scrapper, I got nephews to look after

Everybody give it up for Jagwar Wright come on
That's all you baby that's all you
That's all Jay
Ayo, react, biatch nigga
Think they mess with the rich nigga
Jigga, they can't touch ya
Say y'all, we livin' (?)
You faggot niggas don't play ours, my team'll slay yours
Nay-say yours, can't mess around we lay yours
With our hands in the air, I swear to God
Since money's respected you know I had to get it
Collect it like antiques, and let it stack

Huh, you bet your guns, by any means, I get my ones
You intervene, by any means, I get ya done
Your whole team gotta show Jay love
Simply because, my thing is tighter than O.J. gloves, hah
I get deep and down like ditches
But when I rap I come off like that without the glitches
Never crossed the black cat with the riches
I'm leavin' Stevie sayin' no Wonder you're superstitious
Beef, I'm with it, simple, y'all can all get it
... Y'all don't all get it
'Cause all that matters is this money, 'til it ain't funny
You feel me? When the beat screams kill me
Don't jerk me boy, I rip it silly!
I'll let you rise of course, but if you don't fall off on your own
MC's I cut off at the knees like shorts
It gets worst, if you don't care for my sick thoughts like a nurse
With no known remedy
I'm leavin' boys and men on bended knee 'til the end of the road
I, lock, load, fuck this record shit
With one sale, my bracelet certified gold with rocks
Check it out, uh, check it out, uh
It'll take the Feds to break us
I hope I speak for everybody when I say ain't no dough in this world can escape us
I hold it down like a rapist for these papers
One time video tapin' my crime, monitorin' my sleep
With each and every word I teach, through every word and speech
If y'all niggas ain't talkin' 'bout large money, what's the point?
About the (Roc-A-Fella) had fallen (YEAH!)
One day when I was ridin on the train I seen these two kids talkin
About the (Roc-A-Fella) had fallen (YEAH! Roc-A-Fella y'all! OWWW!)

He asked for it his man saw it so it don't mean shit to me

Let's do this...

Partly because y'all boss ain't a leader
He's a follower, (NO!) no, I'm not coppin ya

The coke coppa, the quick K cooker
He asked for it his man saw it so it don't mean shit to me
He's gone, and that's how it supposed to be
Check it out now! (I get away with mur-mur-murda!)
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the gates?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no love in these streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
Aw, fuck it, you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smoking hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit, I'm in a Diablo
Fresh in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion, losing my religion
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
Live among the serpents, turn arenas into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16's
These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
I had luggage, meaning I had baggage
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, uh
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how heaven taste? Knock me down
Heaven or Hell, the cards we been dealt
Are the cards that we play, play, play
When the shots spray, spray, spray
Hello!
Brooklyn!
Hello, Brooklyn (Uh-huh), how you doing? (Yeah)
Where you going? Can I come too? (Uh-huh)
And If I can (Woo!), I'ma be your man
And drive my cars (Cars), and drive me crazy (So crazy)
Wherever you going (Where you going?), baby girl, just take me (Uh-huh)
'Cause I'm so taken, if you taken (I'm so taken)
I'm just saying (Woo!), baby, I'm just saying
Like a mama, you birth me; Brooklyn, you nursed me
Schooled me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley
They said you'd murk me by the time I was 21
That shit disturbed me, but you never hurt me
Guess what I'ma call her? Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend you
'Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner
And I'm eating, so much, I bought extra
So much so that dinner's now turned into breakfast
I only roll Lexus to hug your road
I love your corners, I'm half your soul
Hello, Brooklyn, how you doing?
Where you going? Can I come too?
And If I can, I'ma be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
'Cause I'm so taken if you taken
Hello, Brooklyn, what's your story?
She said she eating on the run, but she ain't Nore'
She said she got a man but he ain't worried
She said she love B.I.G., and she like 2Pac
And when I said Jay-Z, she say, "It's the Roc!"
And I'ma leave it like this—like this, like that
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Have you seen her?
And when she tell you something, you better believe her
She told me she like my New Orleans demeanor
And "Hello, Brooklyn!" Buh-baby, you are
I said, "Hello, Brooklyn!" Buh-baby
I hope you never say goodbye to me
So damn fine to me
And I remember the time (Time), place (Place)
And the weather (And, woo!)
On the day you said, "Hi," to me
Brooklyn, you crazy; look how you made me
Razor blades in my mouth, walking 'round, behaving—
All demented; black hoodies and Timberland-ed
Always scheming—"You see the gleam on that nigga's pendant?"
(Hello, Brooklyn) You bad influence, look what you had me doing
But I ain't mad at you (Haha), look at my attitude
Baby, I'm cold as ice, like I'm from Brownsville
But my Bed's in the Stuy, though I'll lie flat in your bush
'Til we smoke a C.I., "What up" to the boy, B.I.?
You know I handle B-I, I don't half-step on the 'caine
She like it hardcore, so I grind slow
Iller than Albee Square Mall back in the 9-0
So in a couple years, baby, I'ma bring you some Nets (Woo!)
Hello, Brooklyn, how you doing? (Yeah)
And If I can, I'ma be your man
You could be my lady, and have my baby
And drive my cars (Errr!), and drive me crazy (Errr!)
Wherever you goin' baby girl, just take me
'Cause I'm so taken if you taken
I'm just saying, baby, I'm just saying (Yeah)
And hello, Brooklyn, buh-buh-baby, you are
The sweetest thing eyes could see
Hello, Brooklyn
Baby, I hope you never say goodbye to me
I said, "Hello, Brooklyn," buh-baby you are
So damn fine to me
But I remember the time, place, and the weather
On the day she said hi to me
And I said, "Hello, Brooklyn"
Ay yo I got a resolution
This year I'm playing right
No 6:15 this year, yeah, you can stay the night
We can go bowling, it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing? I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honeys come to the crib
Dig in their shit
Some bad chicks didn't get past the bridge
I went to 1 Trump Plaza on their asses
No room service, just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil Debbies
And when you're done, get ready
The chicks I was fiending to smash
Will take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that player shit
That still can buy weed
And can give me some good head
And I'll make her a mami
(Hey papi!)
(Hey papi!)
Promise you'll never let me go
The only thing Bleek spinning is
Them chrome wheels spinning on them new rims
Home, suspended from school again
I'm grown, still ill, ladies love the ve-hi-cle, like "Bleek
Can I feel up on your wood and grill?"
It's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain
Love the way I push my slang
Calling my jack soon as they hop in my V
They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave
Bet your man can't do it like this, like this
Hoes, they all clock like:
Had niggas mad, for real, like, "I wish he was gay"
Cause they knew sooner or later hun was getting with Jay
Just a matter of time: she was getting with Jay
I'll have your chick in the summer tropics sipping on 'zae
Spitting up in the Pacifics, smoking spliffs in the shade
She used to love you, but she feeling different today
You used to smother her. Look at your honey slipping away
Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
She said she feel free when she's around me
She on the phone with her friends like, "How cool is he?"
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ayo, I got a resolution
No 6:15 and shit (but)
You can stay the night
Can't you, see that I'm growing?
I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honies come to the crib
Some bad chicks didn't get pass the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza on their asses'
No room service, just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil' Debbies and when your done get ready
Let 'em lean on the cash
Take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
I need a chick that practice Tai Chi
And still can buy weed
And can give me some good head
I'll make her remind me, ya hear me?

Had niggas mad for real like, "I wish he was gay"
'Cause they knew, sooner or later hun was getting with Jay
I'll have your chick in the tropics, somewhere sipping on 'zae
Spitting up in the Pacific, smoking spliffs in the shade
Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
She said, she feel free when she around me
I'm letting her do her and in turn she's doing me
She's on the phone with her friends like, "How cool is he?"
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow

(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow, they saying
I was nice to girls but that wasn't the Shawn they felt
They said the coupe was alright, but they ain't like the seat belt
I look tight, they told me loosen up, run a couple of lights
Spank 'em, pull their hair, just don't treat 'em so nice
Nice guys finish last was they special set of rules
And me, I overdid it (uh-huh), all chauvinistic
Would treat 'em so vicious, would stroke, but won't kiss it
But now, I'm trying to flow different
I'm trying to cool it now
I'm trying to plant a seed, start a new edition
I'm sick of chasing chickens
Sick of every other city we go, same ol' hoes
(Hey papi)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going
(Hey papi)
Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me

Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies going

Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long
In search of victory, she keeps eluding me
Why won’t you visit me, until she visits me
She gives me agony, so much agony
She brings me so much pain, so much misery
Like missing your last shot and falling to your knees
I've practiced so hard for this moment victory don’t leave
I know what this means, I’m stuck in this routine
Whole new different day, but the same old things
All I got is dreams, but nobody else could see
Nobody else believes, nobody else but me
Where are you victory? I need you desperately
Not just for the moment, to make history
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long
Hustling like a G, while victory wasn’t watching
As a teenage boy, before acne
Before I got proactive, I couldn’t face she
I just threw on my hoodie and headed to the streets
I swear I met success, we lived together shortly
A success is like lust, she's good for the touch
She's good for the moment, but she’s never enough
Everybody’s had her, she’s nothing like V
But I’m burning down the block, hopin' in and out of V's
But something tells me that there’s much more to see
Before I get killed, cause I can’t get robbed
So before me, success and death ménage
We gotta be together to make history
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle's finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory’s finally ours (Lighters up, lighters up)
History so loved, so long, so long, so long
Now victory is mine, she tastes so sweet
She’s my trophy wife, she's coming with me
We'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly
We'll name him history, he'll repeat after me
He’s my legacy, son of my hard work
Rank me amongst the greats, either 1, 2 or 3
If I ain’t number one then I failed you victory
Ain’t in it for the fame, that dies within weeks
Ain’t in it for the money, can’t take it when you leave
I wanna be remembered long after you grieve
I leave all I am, in the hands of history
This is much more than a song, it’s a baby shower
I’ve been waiting for this hour, history, you're ours
Ah ch-ch ah, ch-ah, ah uh-uh
Ah ch-ch ah, ch-ah, ah uh-uh
It's that hop I'm talkin' 'bout right here Timbo!
I can't be stopped when it hop like this family, uh!
And I won't surrender it with beats by Timbaland
Cállate la boca, my baby
All I want to do is stroke you all crazy
My dick game is vicious, insane at bitches
Mami keep comin' back 'cause mami came vicious
Catch Hov' in the drop, nasty thang, lane switchin'
"Bujando, bujando!" - the cops is comin'
Got that rap patrol behind, yo: get to runnin'
I'm unstoppable Hov', untoppable flows
I'm the compadre, the Sinatra of my day
Ol' Blue Eyes my nigga, "I did it my way"
If y'all not rollin' with Hov' then hit the highway
"Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!"
Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
"Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!"
Put it down for my people
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Naw, I don't fuck around, stay on my J.O.-
Hov' been about that dough since I was a day old
Oh, push perico if I need to for the Root of Evil
Was born in the belly: that's the way the streets breed you
So I truly got to live this like my last movie
6 oohie, jewels drippin', big tooly
And with the third pick, I made the earth sick
I rhyme sicker than every rhyme-spitter
Every crime-nigga that rhyme or touch a mic
Because my mind's quicker
I'm a '88er, '96 to Reasonable Doubt
Temper short; don't take much to squeeze you out
Yeah you shinin', but the only thing you're leavin' out
You're a candle in the sun - that shit don't even out
Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
Put it down for my people
"Hola Hovito!" Yeah, yeah "Hola Hovito!"
Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
Hold up; naw muh'fuckers - y'all muh'fuckers
Better run to the post office and get a job, muh'fuckers
Or starve muh'fuckers, 'cause Jay's been the only one
Eatin' thus far, sub-par muh'fuckers
All rolled in one - 'cause none got more flows than Young
Plus got more flows to come
And if I ain't better than Big, I'm the closest one
So move over - hoes, choose Hova
My food for thought so hot it give you dudes ulcers
Rovers, roasters, hoes is
Gettin' it in with me, livin' like they supposed to
Watches, chain, front row at the game
Sold out arena, all screamin' my name, c'mon!
Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
Put it down for my people
Yeah that's what they sayin' when that music get to bangin'
Put it down for my people
It ain't for everybody! (Uhh)
Welcome to Hollywood, baby (take a picture)
Uh-huh, you coming with? (Let's not even talk about it)
Let's do it (let's go) uh-huh
I see your jealousy as you watching (I see you watching me, baby)
You watching (it's all good)
You watching (uh-huh, come on)
I see your face (I see your face)
You wanna touch it (you wanna touch it)
Come to my place (come to the crib)
And let's discuss it (let's chop it up)
Tonight you gonna be a superstar, baby

You blinded by the (action!)
You need that (Hollywood!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (satisfaction!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Paparazzi spots me in the lobby of my high-rise
I hide behind my shades cause the fame is blinding my eyes
Once had felt when he was as high as I have got
I have got to make this stop
People often warn me that the fame ain't for the faint of heart
Stranger, things have happened
Born in Brooklyn, got a place in Manhattan
Going back to Brooklyn to escape the madness
When your friends is, Chris and Gwyneth
When your girl is more famous than you then it's
Time to get all your windows tinted
Keep your eyes squinted, it's gon' flash any minute
The music biz is like musical chairs
It's about where you standing when the music stop spinning
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (action!)
You need that (Hollywood!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (satisfaction!)
You need that (Hollywood)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
You got to get it (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
Do you want it? (Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
But you don't need it (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
What do you do? Oh oh oh oh
Now that you got what you want
What do you do? Oh oh oh, hey
Oh you want more?
Hey mister, pay six-a, a list-a, you're in the mist of
The ride of your life but you gotta keep them hits up
Can't put your guard down, gotta keep your mitts up
Take a sip, sir, it's so intoxicating, ain't it?
Try not to get jaded, Hollywood's been good to ya
Startin' feel like buzz to ya, don't lie
Gon' fly, you addicted to the lights
Without the fame how you gon' survive
It's like living on heroin, you so high
And everybody warning you about it (I tried to told you)
And once you taste, you can't live without it (it's addictive)
Not cause you choose to not live without it
You sure you want this, baby?
It's now a part of you, it's now a part of you (it's a part of you)
I see you changed, I see you blinded
And once you taste you can't live
You blinded by the (action!)
You need that (Hollywood!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh it's the lights
You blinded by the (satisfaction!)
You need that (Hollywood)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Wanna be seen, male groupies
Now you've become what you once despised
Blow your whole life tryna live in the lights
Heroins following Marilyn
Hoppin' over the edge just like Janis Joplin
River Phoenix, Jimi Hendrix
Jimmy Morrison, all of them ended by
Hollywood, sure you want this baby?
Hollywood
It's the most addicted drug in the world
Want the fame? You want the lights?
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin', but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice; that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame; Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh
And we all just entertainers
And we all just entertainers
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Now I got tattoos on my body
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why, why I love you so much, yeah
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name
But I still don't know why, why our love is so much, yeah
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
Well, I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump
I'm cancer to the Hamptons
Increase the noise pollution, as soon as I land in
Don't even trust uppity white folks
Keep the cannon tuck
Niggas tryin' to lean on Jay, shots gon' stand you up
Glocks gon' pop, y'all not understandin' much
I hustle for the duckets
Chicks now say they like the way I thug it
Since my album dropped, my stock grows like I went public
Ladies I love y'all
But I love my freedom more
I love my niggas, love to see them ball
I love Beans and Bleek
Them niggas like my Peter and Paul
My disciples, and that's right we comin' for the title...
Do you believe? It's Hova the God
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm like, "Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward."
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?"
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
"Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are."
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
"Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?"
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
"Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!"
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
You crazy for this one, Rick
It's your boy
Yeah, I know you just ripped the packaging off your CD
If you're like me, you're reading the credits right now
If you're in your car, I don't care if it's winter
I want you to put all your windows down ... zone out ... buckle up ... let's go ...
Hello, it's Hova
That's right youngin, the wait is over
Before we get into this shit let's get a few things clear
Rappers with no relation, that's 7 degrees of separation
And I'm Kevin Bacon
This is the murderous version
Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person
Hova the god, I should be rapping with a turban
Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him
Mike Jordan of rap, outside j workin'
Now watch how quickly I drop 50
Niggas cannot jam me, niggas can't get me
Slimmie at the Rucker wanna leave and spend with me
I consistently take 'em out the park like Ken Griffey
Do you believe? It's Hova the god ...
Well I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump
I'm cancer to The Hamptons
Increase the noise pollution soon as I land in
Glocks gon' pop, y'all not understanding much
I hustled for the ducats, well now I hustle for the rush
Like fuck it, baby, I just love it
Chicks now, say they like the way I thug it
Since my album dropped, my stock rose ... like I went public
Ladies, I love y'all, but I love my freedom more
I love my niggas, love to see them ball
I love Beans and Bleek
Them niggas like my Peter and Paul
My disciples
And that's right, we're coming for the title
Do you believe? It's Hova the god ...
Used to rap to the raindrops off my window pane
Duckin' the plain cops, pushing indo and 'cane
At the kitchen table, late night, no pen, just my brain
First album, niggas loved me 'cause they thought I was poor
Guess I'm successful, industry don't love me no more
But I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin' raw
Skully tilted, pants saggin', damn near touching the floor
And I come with do-rags to your so-called awards
T-shirt with my chain out, like fuck y'all all
Retrospect, ain't been the same since I lost my dad
He's still alive, but still, fuck you, don't cross my path
A&Rs had me feelin' like Moss in the draft
So I turned the league out with Reasonable Doubt
Get your CDs out
Let's go song for song
I'm the illest nigga doing it 'til y'all prove me wrong
Do you believe?
It's Hova the god ...
Yeah, I know you just ripped the packaging off your CD
If you like me you reading the credits right now
If you in your car, I don't care if it's winter
Zone out, buckle up, let's go
Hello it's Hova; that's right young'un the wait is over
The new millennium is upon us, the album is here
Before we get into the shit, let's get a few things clear
Rappers with no relation:
There's "Seven Degrees of Separation" and I'm Kevin Bacon
Jigga the shit, even when he rhyme in third person
Hova the God, I should be rapping with a turban
Haters can't disturb him, waiters can't serve him
Mike Jordan of rap, outside Jay working
Now watch how quickly I drop 50
I don't like playing, niggas can't stick me
Niggas can not jam me, niggas can't get me
Slimmy at the Rucker wanna leave and spend with me
I consistently take em out the park like Ken Griffey
Do you believe? It's Hova the God
Makes you think about the people in your life
Then I think about BIG; what'd he say if he was here
If you don't go through as a man's a man"
He'd say, "Suck it up, take the fall, do the time
That's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are"
How many years you been around this thing of ours?
Commission, 125 years
What's it about?
It's about rules, parameters
You don't betray who you are, what you are
You gotta remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory
They don't roar, they don't rap
You know why? That's the rules, you don't break them
You was born to be something I wasn't even supposed to be.. humble
Okay so you humble me now, what you got?
You got a worldwide crime syndicate now
There's no rules, there's no parameters, there's no feelings
There's no feelings for this game
You're gonna wish there was American Commission
Five ten years from now...
They're gonna miss Jay-Z
OKAY, I'M RELOADED!
Who ever thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?
Duckin' the plain cops, pushin' endo and 'caine
At the kitchen table, late night, no pen, just my brain
First album, niggas love me 'cause they thought I was poor
Guess I'm successful; industry don't love me no more
Well I'm the same nigga from your corner, bubblin' raw
Skully tilted, pants saggin', damn near touchin' the floor
T-shirt with my chain out like fuck y'all all
Retrospect ain't been the same since I lost my dad
A&R's had me feelin' like Moss in the draft
So I turned the league out with Reasonable Doubt
I'm the illest nigga doin it 'til y'all prove me wrong
Do you believe?
It's Hova the God, uhh, uhh, uhh..
Yes, yes YEP!
Welcome to the.. Jay-Z extravaganza
I'd like to introduce my band right now
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe
Right now I want you to give the drummer some
No ma really, give the drummer some
Uhh
Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, un-breakable
Rock the unrockable (it's Hovi baby)
Follow the flow, look
They say a midget standin' on the giant's shoulder can see much
Further than the giant.. (the giant..)
So I got the whole rap world on my shoulder they tryin' to see
Further than I am... (than I am..)
And I have been tryin' to be patient with they preoccupation
With David and Goliath.. (Goliath..)
But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course
And I'm forced to be a tyrant.. (be a tyrant..)
But me and Tyran, comin' through your environment
Iron mask, nigga, iron gats, nigga I am back
With "The Team," no I in that
R.O.C., y'all not eyein' that
Y'all don't see, clearly 'cause the rain ain't gone
"The Dynasty," no not Ming but Shawn's
Dame, Kareem, nigga it's the gangsta team
Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene
The other reason, we got a gang of green
If there's better at gettin' cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Jeah, look
Back to the future, gotta slow up for the present
I'm fast, niggas can't get pass my past
How they propose to deal with my perfect present?
When I unwrap The Gift & The Curse in one session
Only two restin' in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven straight Summers, critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it
If you did it I done it before, you get it I had it
Got mad at it and don't want it no more
Flippin' whores, flippin' vocal chords, don't get it twisted
Did the impossible then did it twice (get it right)
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Yup! Hovi's home, the global phone
The world is back in order, the number one rap recorder is back
You cats over-felt yourself
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the real for real
In my absence cats get, absent-minded
Why I'm in the position that I am
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor
History in the makin', Pistol Pete
Leave competition shakin' without missin' the beat (woo!)
Chasin' the hi-hat all over the track
The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget
The watch face so blue like it's holdin' it's breath
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check
It's the bow-tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck
Rapper slash Exec., Kordell Stewart
Your flow all y'all using is mine, you're all useless
You all are faggots, you takin' us backwards (takin' it backwards)
I'm tryin' to progress with this rap shit
Nigga, nigga your whole career's a accident
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
I fucks with Hova
I want you to know
It's something about you
(I fucks with Hova)
Trackmasters XO
Let's go!
Untouchable, unbreakable, unshakeable, (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
I got another one!
Yes... (Remix!) Yes... Yes... Baby (it's Hova)
First I had streets, then I had the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I been here from start
I see them put it together, watch them take it apart
See the rovers roll up with the ribbons
I see them repo, resold, and re-driven, so when I reload
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'm gonna be that nigga for life
This is God given, this is hard livin'
Mixed with Cristal sippin'
This is the most consistent (Hov!)
Give me the most hits that you can fit inside a double disc
Homie I'm home on these charts, you niggas visitin'
This Hov' tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm about to claim pole position
Holla at ya boy!
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable
Top the untoppable (it's Hovi baby)
Yes... (Remix) Yes... Yes... baby (it's Hovi)
I'm so far ahead of my time
Look behind you, I'm about to pass you twice
Back to the future, got it slow for the present
When I unwrap "The Gift & the Curse" with a different verse
And I'm so far ahead of my time
My grandpop just met my grand-mom at a high school prom
These rhymes is waiting
'Til four years later, they on time release
He'll probably take them, cop your four copy
You realize that every track needed a autopsy
Like NYPD, LAPD, NYDA, OJ's Jury (yep!)
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Top the untoppable (it's Hovi baby)
Yes... (Remix) Yes... Yes... baby (it's Hovi)
Crush linen, what's winning
If it ain't him in the flesh, continue to guess
I'm about to retire my jersey, fuck Mitchell and Ness
I'ma throwback old school kicks in the Vet
Sixty-nine, yeah, same year I was born
Ninety-six, yeah, I used to rhyme with the Don
Here is something haters can't figure out
Half a milli first week, man they still Jigga'd out
See, I even sell CD's in the crowd
The hardest dude out since Reasonable Doubt
Hovi Baby, love me, or blow me baby
They're in denial
Check the charts, I'm wearing you out
I'm about to drop The Black Album in a year
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Top the untoppable (it's Hovi baby)
Yes... (Remix) Yes... Yes... baby (it's Hovi)
I hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch
Skinny nigga toothpick
But I do lift weights like I'm using roids
Rolls Royce keep my movements, smooth while maneuvering
Please don’t compare me to other rappers
Compare me to trappers
I’m more Frank Lucas than Ludacris
And Luda's my dude
I ain't trying to diss
I’ma follow the rules no matter how much time I’ma get
I’ma live and die with the decisions that I’ma pick
So fuck the haven for caving, that’s why we don’t speak
Made men ain't supposed to make statements
End of the story I followed the code, cracked the safe
Hustle hard in, hustle hard in
Hustle hard in any hustle that you pitch
Money to be made best believe a niggas glocking
I run it myself like a quarterback option
She buy herself some clothes and she brought me back the chopper
See niggas tryna kick but no I don't play soccer
A package on the way you know my whip game proper
And off of 1 ki I see 70 thousand dollars
I bet with your gawdy we hit 5 straight points
You rap about money and a nigga might sign ya
You rap about me and a nigga might find ya
Banana in your ass with your head right behind ya
Dope game bitch his momma woulda bought em
If you holla at me, a fee
Bitches come a dime a dozen
Pussy going, pussy coming
And when they go to you it's coming back to me with money
I tell her put them shoes on and keep my paper running
I put my mack down just like a G supposed to
And if she don’t come home with it then she’s sleeping over
I got em creeping over, we do it then a soda
Them niggas down below us, baby we up and over
I’m trying to get inside that thing that sits between your shoulders
I’m talking large totals
I’m talking large motors
I’m talking burning rubber then melted Pirelli odor
I’m hopping out a Lotus, you looking at my bitch
But when the deed done, you gotta send her back
I'm a hyphen hater
If you are in between my words  I'll see you later
Cause I'm a hyphen hater
You are silent when I speak but I can see you on paper
You are higher than an underscore
But no more
To me, you're as dead as Latin
I can't even hear you, when I am chattin'
So why did you have to get involved? Like some big man that
Was there something wrong with my grammar? Well now it doesn't matter
My name is four letters split by the button which is fatter
You are only good for pause, but when I got my flow
No one will stop me until I bring the applause
My alphabet goes from Jay to Z, you are not a proper letter
So that is why, I have decided that a space is much better
This should not be a surprise to you, your kind of character was up for being dismissed
So now that you are free go catch some vibes with brother asterisk
Forward slash, back slash, hash tag, comma, no thank you
Only the alphabet will do, I'm keepin' it simple with syllable two
After zero is where you belong
At the end of all those numbers is where you are strong
Sharing with cousin underscore
Plus and equals sitting next door
All is not lost, you have set a legacy
On websites, tickets, records and CD
This is not the end
You were more than a connector, you were my friend
There is a new journey on the horizon
I can't get with that
I gotta keep it thick, never miss, so I hit 'em like this
Straight to the track my lyrics is phat I rip it the fuck down
So many brothers be bitin' they tongue to detect who I be
Well check out the J check out the A check out the Y.... Z
Original rap I'm makin it slap I'm hemmin it up like that
I be that nigga with a gat boom-clack
Better than ever, never better, you better, whatever
I suggest some Ex-Lax and that'll get your shit together
I give you a snotty nose from body blows
Nobody's safe at a party even Gotti goes adios
I got-got-got Flav-flav-flav-flavor so save yours
One verse and it's a hearse I played and I slayed yours
Get it, got it, ready to flip, I doubt it
No need to prolong, Jigga the man, gone!
I'm out
The next nigga never get no rest you're livin' with stress
Cause just around the corner be the best nigga
You're fearin my clout if weed got you runnin' your mouth
You better blow that shit out
The Jigga's back you niggas are flat
I'll amaze the way that Jay rap now how in the hell did he say that?
You diggin' me the epitome of rippin' it raw
Although ya niggas are wettin' my style I'm still thristy
And we all gotta fall off but you first G
I'll be the last it'll be a cold day in hell
We break shit and harmony like Take 6
While you niggas double pumped off the fake shit
Our Roc-A-Fella never sell-a-out
Listen
I don't kick it I punt it I'm so wicked you want it?
My tongue's just tired from lickin' my fingers and countin' up hundreds
So I bought a money machine and it goes
A tat-tit-trrrrrrr-at-tit-trrrrrt-at-tit-tit-Git-Dough
How many styles I gotta kick to prove I'm def?
I can even-kick my--rip that-shit-and catch a breath
This nigga's nothin but the truth
Many view Jay-Z as a threat to they loot.. fuck 'em
My shit is tight, can't slip, gotta grip
Like a pit in a dog fight my shit is aight
I ain't checkin' for you 'less you my peoples
And just in case you didn't know peep the steelo
It goes one dime for your mind
And two bone crushers for your spine
Cause none of ya game is rougher than mine
So I face (I'm from the hood man) the final curtain
(No the REAL hood the hood, not the RAP hood)
My friends, I'll say it clear (pair of sneakers)
(My moms is bustin' her ass) State my case
(Nigga I'm goin' to Japan tomorrow!) Which I'm certain
(You understand what I'm sayin'? Can you believe that?)
I lived a life that's full (They have people, waitin'
At the airport like five days like I'm a Beatle or somethin')
(That's really somethin'!) And I traveled each, and every highway
(Seen the best of the best, the worst of the worst) and more
Much more than this (still here) I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
(Let's try this one, uhh, yeah!)
Gangsta nigga
Put my hustle down, tore the game up, nigga
Tore the doors down to the Hall of Fame is Jigga
I did it my way (and more.. much more than this)
That's right, it's a beautiful thing man!
(I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy) I did it my way -- Hovi baby!
Momma's youngest and strongest, survived summers like saunas
Mastered a corner like Deion in his uniform
Pop hurtin' assertive, flirted with death
Grandma's favorite, she could not understand
How there's people in the world who wouldn't want me as a neighbor
As a reminder that I make top paper?
Black entrepreneur, nobody did us no favors
The Rap Pack, I'm Sinatra, Dame's Sam Davis
Biggs the smart one on the low like Dean Martin
Demandin' y'all respect, hand over a check
And while y'all at it, hand over the jet
They knew every year I was droppin' new product
I was raisin' the stock up, while buildin' the Roc up
When it was time for us to re-up, make us multi-million-aires
Je-je-jeah!
And more, much more than this; I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
I caught smaller cases, but I had capital
Hypocritical system let me right back at you
You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
Not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude
They don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
And they can look good by paintin' him as bad news
'Cause in my past, I seen dudes get half of they views
Exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
Let me explain exactly how this shit was
But it’s cool 'cause we back friends, it happened and it's over
It's in the past and I'm glad, now I'm back to bein' Hova
Maybach with the chauffeur, laid back
Helicopter seat, feet inclined, shit feelin' like a sofa
Helicopter meet me, Teterboro take me over
So the next time that page six approaches us
Here's a quote from Jay, nigga I did it my - way
And more, much more than this; I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
Nigga I can make four more albums off memory!
Y'all ain’t never gonna be better than me
I’ma do this 'til I’m 80
Everybody wanna rhyme like Hov'
'Cause I rhyme like I be rhyming in the Rov'
Climbing in them hoes
Mind like a diamond, I’ll blind you at the shows
I don’t shine, I glow, I remind you of that dough, don’t I?
Did I? Hustle the game just the thought alone
Give me a boner, coach cater to a coma
Can’t out hustle a hustler, you can’t outplay a player
This rap shit is a layup
In my former biz, motherfuckers would spray ya
In the music biz, motherfuckers just say stuff
Spit on you and spray yeah niggas just play tough
When the cameras on, When the cameras gone
Niggas want to set up meetings
'Cause they know most likely when I see em’ I’m a set up a beating
Windows no tints, cars no rims
I ain’t touch a wheel since I drove the Bent
That’s cause it was a coupe, nah I ain’t souped
You can’t handle it, handle it nigga is what I do
I tried to be modest on Blueprint 2
You got to believe I think like a artist
But my bills through the roof can’t do numbers like The Roots
No disrespect I be trying to disconnect
But niggas keep pulling me back in, I’m trapped in
My whole living's disordered, and I just got his living room ordered
And you wonder why the chip on my shoulder is more like a brick or a boulder
You’ll understand maybe when you get older
Or what have you, niggas is back stabbing you
Press want to know about the daughter of Matthew
Now it’s back to the hood again, all black hood again
Back to old ladies saying what I could’ve been
Back to the gats – you forgot I’m real good with them
They goin put a nigga in jail, oh well
If I can’t, do it, homie it can’t be done
I’m the one – I’m not the two not the three not the four the five
I take the pain from my life pour it all aside
Used them to kick down the door, brought my people inside
To entertain you, 'cause that ain’t what I came to do
I will bang you, I will act like orangutans do
I give you hot wings turn niggas to angels
Understand my angle, I’m safety first
Don’t make me act like the safety don't work
I’m giving motherfuckers dirt comforters
Night night nigga, take a dirt nap…
I know you hear the footsteps...
This here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers (this ain't music)
I'm 'bout to show you how a hustlers life (this is life man)
And a soldier's life, parallel
And the one thing they got in common is a mother's pain
(Forget about me for a second)
Picture split screen (forget musicians)
On one side we got a hustler getting ready for the block (human beings)
Other side you got the soldier (people) getting ready for boot camp (it's life)
They're both at war
Stay with us
You lost him mama, the war's calling him
He's a soldier
Rose through the ranks as the head of your household
Now its time to provide bank, like he's supposed ta
Now just remember why he's gone 'til November
His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya
Your heart beating so fast speeding his pulse up
Yeah I know it sucks, life ain't all rosebuds
Off to boot camp, the worlds facing terror
Bin Laden been happening in Manhattan
Police was Al'Qaeda to black men
While I was out there hustling, sinning with no religion
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass
Years turn to, "How the fuck we make it in here?"
My barracks average couple fights a day
Get you locked in a hole won't see the light of day
And I feel like I'm just writing my life away
For my team or my siblings whats my reason for living?
I love my niggas more than anything else
This war's about my family, me needing the wealth
'Til you become a 5 star general
P.O.W.'s that's still in the war for real, for real
So don't you worry, about what you see, it will pass
Your baby boy is getting grown
So your baby boy is moving on
I've gotta chase it
And I'm gon' make it, gon' make it
Yeah, your baby boy is getting grown
So your baby boy is moving on
I'm gonna make it, I'm gon' make it
Even if I gotta chase it
This wars taxing to 'em like Uncle Sam
It's death before dishonor
And if he's gone you should honor his memory
They all winners to me, what's up Emory
Come on... life... death...
Here... gone... yo
And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Get on, my niggas
When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas
Don't cry, my niggas, it's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
I did joints with Mary J. Blige, my niggas
I've eluded the coppers, got booted with Big Poppa
At high school got head by the lockers
Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail
Sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me
Everybody around us become one for that day
To live life get your shit right and play
Don't get it twisted like braids, if I'm missed it's okay
But life's short, don't miss a day, uhh
If I should die, don't cry, my niggas
Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Get on, my niggas
When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas
If I should die...
It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Just keep gettin' it on, my niggas
Say word is bond, my niggas
Gettin' shorties like a thespian
Had an episode with two lesbians, got a fetish for that
Drunk ginseng with Japanese chicks and pulled the root out
Squeeze my whole clip to survive shootouts
Been on both coasts, fired all kinds of heat
Probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets
I got de-mands to meet and questions to fulfill
Like is that mystery God real?
And how was Kennedy killed?
I ain't mad, I must've smoked a ton of reefer
Sipped Coronas with Latifah, broke the code of Geneva
I know when I reach the other side I'ma see the
Cat I had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker
Then it's on again, if I could be born again
I live my life through my son
Never shed tears, cry liquor, my nigga
If I die don't cry, my niggas
It's been one hell of a ride, my niggas
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Just keep bangin' these songs, my niggas
Say word is bond, my niggas
If I die...
Just stay gettin' high, my niggas
Don't wonder why, my niggas
When I'm gone live on, my niggas
Just follow my path, my niggas
Say word to Half, my nigga
Born to live forever through life's struggles
Seen niggas life expire right in front of me
Time could never mend what these cold streets
Mentally done to me, too often, I close my eyes
And see my own coffin feelin' haunted
Ready to leave this world that I'm lost in
My only chance to see the seeds I lost through abortion
When I'm gone y'all niggas better not mourn, keep flossin'
As long as my name lives on what's most important
I'll be down in hell scorchin' preparin' for life
Afterlife still torchin' and blazin' these mics
It'd rain for 40 days and 40 nights
And I'd return on the 3rd like Christ
(Without my physical portion)
My spirit a poltergeist for sure
I'll be back through the Heights tomorrow
Blood over y'all fake niggas door
What you thought, huh?
What you thought, nigga?
Just stay gettin' high, my niggas
Don't wonder why, my niggas
Just follow my path, my niggas
Say word to Half, my nigga
When I die...
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Just keep gettin' it on, my niggas
Say word is bond, my niggas
If I die...
... don't cry, my niggas
Just ride, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
And when I'm gone don't mourn, my niggas
Get on, my niggas
When it's real say word to Shawn, my niggas
If I should die...
I'd tell Big they're still hearin' his songs
Is everything that's invisible gone?
I need to know, will I still feel pain or will it be ironic?
Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?
Can I re, veal the game to all the hustlers
Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place?
Can I puff cigars and drink Cristal?
If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?
Can I still touch lives, answer their "whats and whys"
Make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five?
If I should die... don't cry, my niggas
Uh, Yeah
Tone Hooker y'all
It's a beautiful thing you know
If you want it
We got it
If you want it
We got it (baby)
Now we got mystical street visions of making multiple Deniro
The mula makes the gods fly but we don't need another hero
While gun runners be steady gun toting
I'm on a seven day cruise laying, flowing steady rocking the boat
And the champaign got me feeling eerie
My style got me spilling liquor for niggas locked on the island
Baby brother could be the man soon
Living lovely, laying up in luxury sailing to Cancun
Mehico, You know the math kid we get cabbage
Let me go, Let's take a break from all these wild savages streets
I burst the flow in places ????, comeback on another day
So we can handle these brinks in a better way and
That's how it had to be and Ladies are mad at me when
Word on the street the men calling me there majesty and
It must be true I heard it from the Caribbean's
Well I'm in love with the last sexy black Mohican
Remember me if not the bubbly, the Hennessy and
Acknowledge my wisdom then understand my culture street and
Redefine this powerful life back from the Europeans
Without chocking, I'm smoking on potent paraphenelia
Ghetto Celeb's keeping love, love
If you want it (baby)
We got it (baby)
We got it (baby)
We got it (baby)
If you want it (Every night)
We got it (baby)
(Jay-Z: What The Fuck)
Roc-A-Fella gang, Suit Up
Till you die get you're loot up
Do what you like, It's still in me
When assets become liability's
Back to dealing G's
But feeling these
To bomb like Lebanese
Forever cheese
Vast game, Live out my life like a movie
Till the last rain, blasting the ooze, till I'm woozy
Gordo at $12.99 a CD
Jay-Z & Tone Hooker is ???
Blasting in the auto
The crystal got me thinking about more though
Watch out girl, If I needed
I can't be stopped, Won't be defeated
I come to take you're shit you gotta leave it
If I want it I got the guns for it player run it
Fowl, Nothing less than six digits out my mouth (uh-huh)
If i ain't platinum soon then It's back down south (say what)
Ill built like whatever y'all I'm back on the set
Came to claim what I left because my name still rep
Except on the screen (uh), Tryna blow up my flow
It's an all out thing, No time to front
We make it happen, yeah we go it locked down
Fuck y'all want
For all y'all laughing dudes
Trying to knock this get money music
Trying to have it like the havers have it
You Know
Not wish it like the wishers want it
Getting this cake and what not
But I'll tell you what
What ever heads you know, struggling
And ain't trying to get money
Uhh, uhh, yes sir!
Just the sound of his voice is a hit, heh heh
Y'all niggas got me really confused out there

Y'all hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century

Y'all question whether he fallin' off?
When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
"That's him!", I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he with, or his chip amount
Baggin' up at the Ramada, table full of powder
A/C broke, 'bout to take another shower on my 25th Hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game or the fight
You might see me anywhere, a day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night
I'm so bossy, bitch get off me
Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6's on Sprees
Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me

Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like it don't front!
They're all actors, lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
They're all weirdos, De Niros in practice
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures
It's mostly backwards, unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song you happen to see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
And with that said, I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell
Shoot niggas straight through the ER, whoa!
This ain't B.R., no, it's S.C., CEO
The next Lyor, no, the next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel, go...

The '07 Ice Cube, B. Sig so rude
Tell a trick, get these nuts, eat dick like food
Now see if I care if this verse get aired
I'm so raunchy, bitch get off me
Keep my flea collar on, you lil' ticks get off me
I missed the part when it stopped bein' 'bout Imus
What do my lyrics got to do with this shit!
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Is worse than these celebrataunts showin' they kitten, you kiddin'!
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin'
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Let's stop the bullshittin'
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin', c'mon

Stares get exchanged then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
"That's him!", I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he wit', or his chip amount
'Cause I been doin' this since CHiPs was out

Can't even face themselves, don't fear no rappers
They're all weirdos, De Niros in practice
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures

I built an ark, mami, cry me a river
Blacken my heart by puttin' light liquor in the liver
Young Goldie, The Mack forever
Said a G don't give a bitch no keys or security codes
I agree, my lady ain't no bitch, she gets whatever I own
So when you see her, understand that's me, nigga

My presence is a must- must- must-
Bonita Applebum, I gotta put you on

Like every color Giuseppe's, your guilty pleasure is me
It's so much fun, you shun therapy
Although it never be, the feeling is fleeting
Shopping's like copping, you constantly need it
I'm never around, you constantly seek it
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps
I keep trying to remind you to keep telling yourself
But when that medicine's felt
Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me

Jumped out like "YO! Who the fuck you with?"
Flash the jewels 'cause that's the rule
Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes
Face natural - can I get at you?
Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo
With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun
I didn't know how many niggas was humping hon
I said I never seen a face like yours before
And I been around some cute whores before
That either me or my boys tore it up before
So I'm hoping you different, let you push the 6 and
Give you a different life and baby if it's right
Jump on it in the morning and ride it 'til the night
Want to buy you real jewelry when it hits the light
Bitches'll momentarily lose they sight
She said

I know what boys like, boys like me
You want a cutie with a booty like POW!
Deeper than a MILE! Earrings shine like TADOW!
But I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things
Only real bitches live like queens - Get it?
Safety deposit in the walk-in closet
Marble faucets and matching Rolls Royces
In the driveway from Monday to Friday
I be the richest, shitting on these bitches
While chickens cluck giving up the butt
I plays the cut with the Daddy Warbucks
You can call me a slut, who gives a fuck
That's fine nigga shit, I'm good with mine

Fuck a pre-nup give me half up front

Victoria Secret lingerie, ice like Don King
The price was like eight digits a long way, shit
Got the beachfront view, V1 too
Cop you one, cop me one too
On the place, jet ski's park by the lake
Invite your friends over
Let 'em make their way through the Benzes and the Rovers
Vacate, away a week or more
First class to and fro, freaking off
Got to have things locked, champagne popped

My earliest stages to being on stages
Having my way with the world, congratulations!!
Your baby boy's a made man I'm a hold the fam down like three generations

For repairing my relationship with my pops before he passed
Toast to the most beautiful girl in the world
My inspiration thanks for the information
Momma I made it... momma I made it
Out in BK where
It ain't everyday that you make it out
Be on top of yachts waving
Now our crib dark as a basement
Had to lock up the phone when you wasn't home
We was communicating like the money you made wasn't basic
Our cable was basic no HBO, WHT, just Ralph McDaniels on the station
I aggravated you for Atari and ColecoVision pinstripe Lee's
When the first day of school came in
Long as Saturdays you had the Commodores playing
The expression on your face was priceless
Still with me till this day baby girl I won't erase it
I go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made
You deserve a standing ovation
Momma I made it... momma I made it
Now your lil misfit make sure every day is Christmas, write out your wish list
6's, wrist is glistening you don't even like jewels
But you could get missing anywhere you like to
Where the waters light blue, anything you order
Sign it to your nice room leave a extra tip, ma
Be extra nice to 'em
CEO of Carter Foundation, wow!
I know Colleek somewhere up in the clouds like
Go get 'em Grandma make me proud
Didn't have a man in the house so you made one
So I act like your husband and I'm only your son
I told you one day I'd get you a home
I didn't know it could possibly be in Rome
Told me don't wait on nobody, get your own
So with me myself and my microphone, I made it
Momma I made it... momma I made it
Yeah, I mean like
I was popping that Cristal
Wearing that platinum shit
When all y'all chicks thought it was silver and shit
(Imaginary playmates)
Bottom line (Imaginary playmates)
I'ma show you how to do it, check it
Yo, I spit that other shit
That's a nice motherfucker shit
That Fed time follow me around, Deep Cover shit, nigga
You beer money, I'm all year money
I'm "Papi, you ain't got to count it, it's all there" money
I never change money 'cause niggas got strange money
NARC'd up, marked up, fucked up in the game money
I spit the hottest shit, you need it I got it shit
I got blood money, straight up thug money
You got show dough, little to no dough
Sell a bunch of records and you still owe dough
I got 900 and 96 plus 4 mo' dough
You crazy, you fugazi, I'm loco with dough papo
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
And now you got these young cats acting like they slung caps
All in they dumb raps, talking about how they funds stack
When I see them in the street, I don't see none of that
Damn playboy, where the fuck is the Hummer at?
Where's all the ice with all the platinum under that?
Those ain't Rolex diamonds, what the fuck you done to that?
Y'all rapping-ass niggas, y'all funny to me
You're selling records being you, but still you wanna be me
I guess for every buck you make it's like a hundred for me
And still you running around thinking you got something on me
But I done did it
And y'all want to take my flow, and run with it
That's cool, I was the first one with it
Sit it down, I don't want y'all to get it confused
I rip it down, like I ain't got nothing to lose
(Y'all get it now?)
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Groupies I leave 'em all fucked; niggas, awe struck
Your single was 99 cents, mines was 4 bucks
Last year, when niggas thought it was all up
Nigga stop whining, Jigga, still shining
Niggas kept complaining so I copped more diamonds
I still throw t'ree in your body, fleeing the party
Y'all can't go with me, nope, flow with me
Bet 50, not dollars either I brought some dough with me
I flow like the 5 Series, in various areas
And blow holes in your weak niggas theories
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
I mean, like, be truthful, man: how you think you gon' feel, right?
You pull up in your 4.0 with your bitch
I pull up in the 4.6 with my bitch with the seat back
Bumping some other shit, you know, some OTHER shit
Ask me some stupid shit like
"Yo, yo dog, what’s the difference between a 4.0 and a 4.6?"
Like 30 to 40 grand, cocksucker, beat it! Haha
Yo, them shits even got leathers?
Guru turn this shit up (OW!)
I know a million people already did this
Let's make it a billion
OG I'm going in! (bounce)
Big Bizzle, happy birthday my nigga!
Geah, a billi, a billi, a billi a billionaire
Call me Philli Collins, I feel a billion is in the air
And John Meneilly-onaire is my consigliere
When I wear Billionaire Boys Club, it's more than gear
I don't wear it cause Pharrell, I wear it 'cause I'm fo'real
(I see dead people)
I'm a natural born hustler, Marcy Projects motherfucker
Turned professional journalist reporting, live from the gutter
Where girls, carry box-cutters
Brothers shoot up with undercovers
Screaming "FUCK THE WORLD!" Why? 'Cause don't nobody love us
Shawn Carter, Sean Bell, what's the difference? Do tell
50 shots or 50 mill', ain't no difference go to hell
So, BRRRAK, lick a shot for, BRRRACK Obama, change gon' come or
I'ma buy the whole hood llamas on me
It is whatever it's gon' be, on three
Declaring, I'm free, bumping 'Pac and the Outlawz
I'm flyer than all outdoors, I ball out hard
I buy, champagne companies, I'm past buying out bars
But I flew, back, back and forth like Aaliyah (Rest in Peace to ya)
Takes a nation of millions to hold us back
But when your boy reach a billion it's a wrap (off of RAP?!) YEAH!
Roc Nation it takes a nation to stop
I'm signing off, it's the hood's Barack, BRRRACK!
Motherfucker I'm ill!
What's up baby girl! (oooh!)
Thought I had to talk to you again, missing you (hey, ey, ey, ey)
Tim is missing you, Missy's missing you
Your pop is missing you, Dame is missing you
Damn we missing you... WOO!!!
4 Page Letters, in addition to
Have you ever loved somebody used to get the party popping
We was The Breakfast Club, you was a part of the ROC
We used to make up special names for the food we ate
Well Dame told me tell you he's doing well
But I ain't got to tell you, you looking over us
Our little angel, but you know what
Brooklyn's missing you, Detroit is missing you
New Orleans missing you, Philly's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Your fans is missing you, Valerie's missing you
Damn we missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Now Star is mad I won't grant him an interview
Now he's dissing me, 'cause he dissed you
Can you believe the nerve of this dude?
'Cause of your memory I won't bring it to pistols
(Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you)
But I know God protecting you
You used to read Seat Of The Soul, I know God perfecting you (I miss you)
All the extra hue, the darker texture you are
The more intellectual you are
Too good for earth you are (I, miss, you)
Houston's missing you, L.A.'s missing you
D.C.'s missing you, Chicago's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Kidada's missing you, Chak' is missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
We feel your presence just not in the physical
All across the world, blocks is miserable
But they not original and they not identical
I swear in hip hop, if it's not ten of you
Then it gotta be more, y'all left your paws
Footprints on the game, hood ain't been the same
Feeling ain't been in music, hooks ain't been the same
But I'm doing what I can, man
Tryin to follow y'all down memory lane, man
And it proves how much niggas really miss you
Left Eye, we missing you, Jay, we missing you
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Scott La Rock, the list goes on
The world is missing you, the hood is missing you
(Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you)
Nah mean, miss y'all (I miss you)
Soldiers and soldierettes, all across the world (I miss you)
We gon' hold y'all down, y'all living in our memories forever
We never gon' let y'all go
I, can't, think, no, more (we not remembering y'all death though!)
Since you went away (we celebrating your life, nah mean!)
I don't really feel like talking, don't wanna hear you love me
Baby (yes!) do you understand me (yes, yes, yes!)
I can't do a thing without you (damn we missing you)
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you, I miss you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you, I miss you
This song here is dedicated to Danny Dan, may he rest in peace
Who at his funeral left us with the words that
While niggas are shootin' stupid, I'm carefully plottin'
Ways to make it rotten, well-planned hits until you're long forgotten
Y'all niggas that utilize my style don't hurt me
'Cause on the low half of these rappin' ass niggas wanna work for me
Now picture me standin' on somebody block tryin' to rock
While you're starin' on my dick nigga, gimme yours
I don't hassle with capsules, cause that'll make the grass grow
If I'ma risk a frisk, gettin' my wrists wrapped up in steel
I'm out here trying to make a mill', my shit is real for real
While others worship guns I worship tons of money
Tons of fun, laughin' at shit that ain't even funny
So I ain't pressed to make a CD, I took it slow
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
I need a whole lot of dough
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
I need a whole lot of dough
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash
I need a whole lot of cash
More ice than winter '94
I toured the 50 states with a trunk of raw
Recruitin', I'm hittin' shorties with consignment but don't play me
I'm laid back in the five thousand Italian leather seat recliner
Under some vagina, discussin' the finer, things
Lettin' the shorties slide by once in a while and let 'em dream
They think I've mastered the game, cause dames scream my name
With passion, I tell 'em stop flashin' and start stashin'
And we'll all get off the corner, the only heat you'll feel
And fuck that weed, it keeps you broke, invest in
Pounds of herbs and profit if niggas wanna smoke dope
But keep your nuts, 'cause this is a man's game
And we'll all pop champagne till it's a damn shame
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash
I need a whole lot of cash
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
I need a whole lot of dough
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash
I need a whole lot of cash
I'm shootin' to Vegas, gamblin' green-o at the casino
Schoolin' the dice like Vinny Barberino
Welcome back, the '95 version of The Mack
As soon as these ladies see me they don't know how to act
Cause like that, nigga, never twist the cap of malt liquor
Only pop and droppin' Cristal's down my throat, take a swigga
You're rollin' with a pro with, money to blow child
Unfold a pack of bills, grab my balls then bet it all
On the block you lucky if you see my silhouette
I'm ghost, envied by most
So I keep a crew of crazy tenants that's sling toast, fucker
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
I need a whole lot of dough
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash
I need a whole lot of cash
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of dough
I need a whole lot of dough
In my lifetime, I need to see a whole lot of stash
I need a whole lot of cash
Ski, Roc-a-Blok Productions, uh-huh, uh-huh
Dame Dash, ha-ha, Roc-a-fella Records, uh huh
Sauce Money, Big Sarge, B High
DJ Clark Kent, everybody Uptown
Best Out, my V-A clique running thick
D'Shawn definitely in the house
Roughness y'all, this how we do
"In my lifetime"
"In my lifetime"
It's the thought of a ride that make my eyes wide, I'm caught up
I'm tryna make all of my dreams materialize, so I sorta
I found a new route, you 'bout to see my life change
I make the means justify the ends
I make the cream, materialize keys to a Benz
And so I'm rollin'
For now, holdin' down the fort, who's controllin'?
The ground's gotta blow 'em, yep, y'all shoulda told 'em
Uhh, my first felony's approachin'
I bought a black MAC, I'm outta control
Losin' bankrolls on blackjack, you gotta know
It always crossed my mind
That Feds be tappin' the lines like Gregory Hines
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life, uh
"In my lifetime"
"In my lifetime"
I'm like the bass with the ass, splashin' cold cash
Is it, just a mirage all these girls thankin' God?
Is this, world my world? Am I the star of stars?
Baby, pimped out, I'm gettin' too large and smokin' cigars
All chicks is hollerin' about Jig-ga, the whole city's buzzin'
Wasn't checkin' for me a dozen or so, months ago
Now I'm all they know, I'm a person (yeah)
Lettin' the Cristal's breathe at the Barnacle Bar
Under my sleeve, vernacular, 50 G's
Uhh, give me a rush like you wouldn't believe
My head's about to bust, acceleratin' what drives me
Hope I don't gotta die to see, see, I can't lie to me
I know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Still my blood flows ice, it's just my life
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
"In my lifetime"
Uhh, from the beginnin', see, we never seen the endin'
Runnin' up in all the women, all the linen, all the jewels, huh
We sported Pele's, gold diamonds and Pirelli's
But that's cool, as I zone in the Al Capone, watch me
'Cause the Medusa's head on Versace turned me to stone
Bones get disconnected like the phones
Like the Garden, all my penpals life controlled by the warden
I could do real time, I'm a prisoner of my crimes
Know the price, know the risk, know the wrongs and the rights
Now I'm incarcerated for my life
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
What's the meaning, what's the meaning of life?
"In my lifetime"
"In my lifetime"
The other night when I was researching what was going to be discussed today I came across a passage wrote down, I think it really exemplifies what the young brother next to me was just talking about and I learned that all things must come to an end
It is an inevitable part of the cycle of existence, all things must conclude
That came before
That came before
That came before
"Man I worked for one of the biggest companies in New York City
He didn't own his own company
(Your gangster is not defined)
Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall by your waist, but more how your genes stand up to their expectations
"Never forgetting where we came from."
(Your gangster, your gangster)
Your gangster is not defined by how many rocks are in your watch
Conservatives, labour
The seller, the buyer, the product, the producer
"See you are what you are in this world."
The gangster is absorbed and adored by those that don't understand the laws that govern the gangsterment
(Gangsterment, gangsterment)
Gangsterment allows you to make up your own laws
And create brand new words, gangster mentality
Mastered by the black, and absorbed by the fiends
Taxed by the governmentality, governmentality (governmentality)
Charted by Forbes, if you believe in Jay-Z
Then you too can be a gangster) then you too can be a gangster
By any means necessary, by owning that dream
I mean it's a long walk to freedom
But, while deep, deep, deep inside the bush
(The war on terror screams, damn it feels good)
Damn it feels good to be a gangster, haha
(To be a gangster, swagger is not a must, it's a liability
A cliché, a bad suit, cut the bullshit
You know if it wasn't for this, there would be no that)
Which we call, the American Gangster
Somebody's pulling me closer to the ground
I ain't panicked, I been here before
Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage
In front of that crowd
And showed them who was who, and what was what
Man look at these suckers
I ain't no rapper, I'm a hustler
It just so happens that I know how to rap
A million
Fucked up, right? Ha, I know
I know what y'all niggas asking yourself
Is he gon' ever fall off?
... A lot of speculation
On the monies I've made, honies I've slayed
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Is it true he stayed in beef and slept with a TEC?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck
If Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O?
For the millionth time, asking me questions
Like Wendy Williams, harassing me
While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinning on my sleeve
Ugh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?
What you doin in L.A., with Filipinos and Eses?
Latinos and Chevys, down by Pico with Frederico
I'll answer all your questions but then y'all got to go
Now the question I ask you is, "How bad you wanna know?"
BLAOW!
A million
Roc-A-Fella y'all, uhh, uh
Know my style
Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more
'Til I'm no more, 'cause I'm so raw
My flow expose holes that they find in yours
Wasn't for me, niggas still be dying for whores
But I hate when a nigga sit back, admiring yours
Niggas don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse
I used to be O.T., applyin' the force
Shoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss
Come back with the clique playing Diana Ross
I'm the boss and this is how it's gon' be
I got mouths to feed 'til they put flowers on me
And kiss my cold cheek, chicks crying like I was Cochise
Tombstone read, "He was holdin' no leaks"
On MTV, telling 'em how I sold D
And used to bag work up out of apartment 4-B
Me and my homie, started out co-d's
Picked the mailbox lock 'cause I ain't have no key
Had the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie'
Then I went low key, but now I'm back, it's on
Motherfuckers!
Jigga, uh-huh, yeah
Roc-A-Fella y'all, uuuh
Uhh, feel this
Sorry boys
But all the money in the world couldn't bring me back again
Lay down, lay down
Gonna stretch my mic out in Ponce Funeral Home on Marcy
But a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
The last of the real hustlers, well, maybe not the last
Bleek's gonna be a good rapper
New, improved Jay-Z -- I quit
Sorry Big, I tried, honest
Can't go with me on this ride though, I'm calling the shots
The bar's closing, where we going to for breakfast?
Roc-A-Fella y'all -- OKAY, I'M RELOADED!
"Bringing the drama"
"Add a couple of dollar signs to my name""Roc-A-Fella y'all"
"One of the best!"
"Waiting for my day to come"
Nah this ain't Jigga, it's your lil nigga Bleek
Reporting to these motherfuckers live from the street
At nine I used to geese hoes for Easter clothes
Peep the steez, I represent for all those
With 28 grams, on a come-up trying to creep the keys
Large niggas told me park the car, keep the keys
Find a hoodrat and creep to Mickey D's
First gun two bullets, niggas know I do pull it
Niggas trying to kill me dog, who wouldn't?
Lit off the EJ, I split Dutchies with my ring finger
You find a bitch that owe me cream, bring her
Last seen with Bing, he got dropped between us
Johnson and Johnson for the nonsense, who wants it?
I go to sleep with a picture of a Porsche on my wall
Man I'm trying to come up on y'all, get one up on y'all
That's why I hustle in these streets from sundown to sunup on y'all
Mama said keep bullshitting they'll kill you dead
One week of this hustling brought a living room set
Went to Tom D's, niggas mad, veins out
Copped the Jordan's, two weeks before they came out
Nosy bitch from the third floor like "Why little nigga?"
Bitch please, twist the trees
Took a long pull, like bitch to breathe
That's my answer, life's like cancer
"Waiting for my day to come"
"Just give me the word"
Jay-Z, Marcy, Brooklyn
Representin' the, what, what
Roc-A-Fella y'all, for life
Stretch Armstrong
Bring the noise, haha
You know how we get down
Uh, Roc-A-Fella's capo, unflappable
Test my weight in the Apple
Never a question of if, but when you gonna die like cattle
Beef, I go at it so rugged, you swear, I love it
Is that so, hard to learn?
My burner give niggas permanent heart murmurs
My, crew endangers
Estranged miscellaneous niggas
Left in troubled waters like Greg Louganis
Or wherever the fuck you cats rest your head at, dead that
The last time you seen us, niggas popped up in Beamers
Or it's Soulshocker, Jigga Niggademus
Murderous writin', not a word of it to your likin'
Since we make you hate to love it like Prince
'Til a nigga feel straight like Bill Gates
Or feel a mil'-eight, we gon' spill hate, in-fil-trate
Die! It's your fate, realize the great
Get your hardhats, professionals rockin', nigga, wait
Timing's everything, everything that glitters ain't gold
There's diamonds in every ring, what the fuck!
Muggsy Bogues style, now a nigga bigger than Shaq
Crib in the Cat, skills, living phat
Chickens that used to act ill
A nigga bitter so, when a nigga hit you, believe (Ugh)
I'm tryna hurt your stomach like ten thousand sit-ups (Yeah)
Jigs, baby, what it is! Just as casual
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah
Every time, y'all (Roc-A-Fella, y'all)
What, what, Jay-Z, huh (What, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella y'all (Marcy)
Yeah, yeah uh-huh
(Let these niggas know)
West Coast niggas, man
Getting out of line, man
Watch your step, haha
Fuck around
Yo, react, biatch nigga
Think they can fuck with the rich nigga
You faggot niggas don't play yours, my team'll slay yours
Naysayers, can't fuck around we lay yours
With our hands up there, shit, I swear to God
Since money's respected you know I had to get it
'Cause too many bastards tried to get they groove on
He ain't sellin' no records, is he? That nigga gotta hustle
Shit, you bet your guns, by any means, I get my ones
You intervene, by any means, I get ya done
For real
Uh, yo don't get mad at me
I don't love 'em, I fuck 'em
I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em
I replace 'em with another one
You had to see she keep calling me B.I.G
And my name is Jay-Z
She be all on my dick
Gradually I'm taking over your bitch
Coming over your shit
You coming home to dishes and empty soda cans
I got your bitch in my Rover man
I never kiss her, I never hold her hand
I'ma pimp her, it's over man
(It's over man, it's over man...)
Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes
While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch? Why she paging him?
Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!
Room 112, hotel balcony
How she say Jay you can call the house for me?
There's no respect at all
You betta check her dawg
She keep beggin' me to hit it raw
So she can have my kids and say it was yours
Shit, I put the rubber on tighter
Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?
She got you whipped, got your kids
Got your home, but that's not your bitch
You share that girl, don't let 'em hear that he'll hurl
It'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick
Ain't saving it, unfaithful bitch
Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips
With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes
Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch? Why she paging him?
Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!
Cool out homie
You betta keep her away from my balling clique
Keep her out of nightclubs all in the mix
From hanging out with chicks who be swallowing dicks
Hot boy like Jigga Man scorch your bitch
Play the four dot, Jigga Man go first
Then we all rock 'til we all hot
You know the boy from the Roc got them whores on lock
Got the bitches in the smash
Make them drawers drop fast
'Cause we get more cash than the average nigga?
All them hoes like "Damn, I gotta have this nigga"
'Cause I'ma hot black, how in the hell can you stop that?
You would fuck mine
I'm just playing the cards choosenly
Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes
Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill
While you all in his grill, don't you know that man kill?
Is that your bitch? Why she paging him?
Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!
The Jigga and Twista got 'em screaming
Like a demon fiending for the semen
Chrome gleaming like the dome on Keenan
Gone while I'm leanin' smoking
Your bitch on the passenger side of me flashing your money
You know she been flirting while your working
Behind the curtain knuckles jerking for certain
Poppin' that pussy
Sweatin' till no fluid is left
When I come in the party with Jay we gon' do it to death
You gon' ruin your rep
Trippin' while we pimpin' these hefers
Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
To climax I come up with a nab
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us 'cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put the dick up inside her
Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips
Is that your bitch? Why she all in his ride?
With her hand on his thighs keep looking in his eyes
Oh, is that your bitch? You better tell her chill
Is that your bitch? Why she paging him?
Keep praising him? 'Cause that's Jay and them, bitch!
Oh, is that your bitch? Why she all in his six?
With her hand on his dick keep licking her lips

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla at your boy
What's the problem shorty?
Yeah whattup man
I'm the only nigga from Brooklyn out here man
I'm tryin to lock the spot down, holla at me
Alright; hold on - Hova, line one
Here's a couple of suggestions of how you could finesse it
You find a dude in town, you send him a short message
But I got some soft white that's sure to come back brown
I get that butter all night
Cause most niggas don't know a brick from a bite
They keep buying hard white
And if you free tomorrow night we can meet and discuss price
Or -- you find a chick, shit, you hole up in her crib and
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
Then -- before they look up you sellin the town cook-up
Or -- gorilla pimp, come up on that killer shit
Take a nigga brick, smack him, then you sell it back to them
Yeah yeah that's gangsta, I think I'mma roll with that one
Make out a check for eight hundred dollars
The niggas takin too long with that advance money and shit
Let me holla at somebody real
Bleek, line two
Listen shorty, you wanna roll just give me the word
I ain't got time for a sentence all that shit is absurd
You find a strip first, if you don't cook find a bitch first
If you don't hustle find a nigga who pitch first
You new in town, no red and blue in town, that's gangs
The strong move quiet, the weak start riots
We know you got a brick but sell 'em twenties til they tired
With no credit, you know you sick with that gotta eat fetish
And other niggas who gettin it - DEAD IT
Make 'em an offer that they can't refuse
He resists, box him in, til he can't be moved
Here's the rules: chop it, bag it, stash it, stack it
Get in, get out - that's a O.G.'s classic
900-Hustler, you pass it around
{*click*, *dial tone*}
I got two bricks
Been on hold for about two hours nigga
{*click*, *classical type music plays*}
This bullshit-ass elevator music
First things first, watch what you say out your mouth
Never play the house, think drought, keep heat in the couch
When you sittin in the presence of cus-tomers
If a nigga ever think that he touchin-ya
Lay low, get cake, whip all over the state
Stash dough, whip yay with, right amount of bake (ho!)
Nigga too close went right around his place (yo!)
You stoppin dough when we clutching the gas
I know you heard "Friend or Foe," this ain't different from that
Make sure you got your four-four and he can slip if he like
Young, Jon Benet daughter missin tonight and yo
Until you up stay away from them dice and whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Cause boys want three bundles two streaks and pipe for sure
And if it's tight, then he might come back for more
Nine and four, everyday back and forth
Winter to summer, 1-900-Hustler
Tell you how to weigh shit wet and package more
Two E's, that'll be two G's
And forget my money I'm comin for all your ki's, nigga
{*click*, *dial tone*}
You talkin all reckless on the phone
Get-Indicted-Hotline or somethin motherfucker?
I know I was talkin reckless earlier about them two chickens
You get it, you know, two chickens? But listen
I'm pushin hardly half a wing back nigga, holla
{*click*, *dial tone*}
My first brick did it
I knew I was addicted when I flipped it to four
Then I whipped it to more
And it's like the streets call you:
"How could you leave me after all I done for you?
Who else would employ you? I made you feel royal
All it took was some oil, some water
My first taste of power, I'm numb off the feeling
I'm done off, niggas, I can't stop dealing
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot
Ain't you afraid to go to jail? God
Well use your brain, are you sane?
But like Dale Earnhardt, the game is racing through my veins
And I crash every time, but like I never hit the wall
I need the K's like Pedro so I'm back pitching raw
And when the bases are loaded and cops try to squeeze play
The game ain't cold enough to ever freeze Jay
And I, need the green like fiends need yay'
And they, say it ain't right but it's the game of life
I'm addicted to the game
I rap now, I eat good
I smoke good, drink good
Multi-millionaire but still I think hood
I guess it's just the need to be heard
I need niggas to say, "I can't believe ya words"
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Thoughts is sporadic, I gotta unconfuse it
Sort of like a Rubik's Cube is
Every album's a color, but I fuck up the other, color
Ha, I guess I'm more like
A bitch with a belly but her ass is right, haha
Y'all don't understand me still
I'll never enjoy my success but my family will
So the rap Jerry Rice is back
To fulfill the need, though I lead the league
I pray everyday, I travel at God's Speed
Not a minute slower 'cause the minute you Hova
Everybody's praying for your spinach to slow up
Holding your breath 'cause the force that's controlling my step
Until I'm one with the music
'Til I'm dead and gone, in search of the perfect song, mon mon
I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot
Uh, letter to my dad that I never wrote
Words on a paper that I never read
Proses never penned, they stayed in my head
Jotted on dotted lines, "I'ma fight you, nigga"
From stories that I heard, I'm just like you, nigga
Must it be the energy that passed through
Must've been a pastor, many snafus
Started a good man, you married my mama
I was in her belly, you hurried that Summer
She had two kids from a previous mister
One family, I don't believe in half-sisters
Remembered the many lessons when we stepped out
Did you see the runt as the front-runner
What ancestors did you summon to the summit
To give me what I needed, what you need to take from 'em
The tsunamis that I swum in to become in
Had the cable with the anchor for the places that I sunk in
Unc in a better place but you couldn't function
You wanna make God laugh, just tell him your plans
Who would've thought I'd be the dad I never had
Be the husband I've become, usually nothing come from that
I forgive you as I live through the beautiful present of the past
What was you preparing us—
For?
It was all a dream
Felt so real to me, this is what was said
"Had a dream," I said; "Bout who?" he said
"'Bout B.I.G.," I said; "That's big," he said
"Dig what he said"; "Proceed," he said
"Indeed," I said, so, breathe I did
"Don't repeat what I say," I said, he said nothing
What I believe to be a yes, I repeated what was said
"It came to me like a whisper last evening," I said
"What's the deal, playboy?" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know was the reason he was dead
"Mo' Money Mo' Problems,'" better believe it," he said
"Careful what you wish for, you might receive it," he said
"I see," I said, "jealousy" I said
"Got the whole industry mad at me," I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!"
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
"What he said," I said, "has been said before"
"Just keep doin your thing," he said; "say no more"
Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
I gotta know (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Every Saturday, Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke, "duh-ha, duh-ha"
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the (World Trade)
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Was it all a dream - tell me
Was it all a dream, was it a dream
I gotta know (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream - was it a dream
Was it all a dream, a dream
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
"I see," I said, "jealousy" I said
Then B.I. said, "Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!"
"I agree," I said, "my one of a kind self"
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
"What he said," I said, "has been said before"
"Just keep doin your thing," he said; "say no more"
Ain't I
I'm a... I'm a... I'm a
I'm a hustler's hustler
A gangster's gangster
I'm a rapper's rapper
Your favorite, ain't I
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I
I'm still winning and I'm nowhere near finished
It's just the first inning
Y'all hate me, y'all atheists
Y'all safety is at risk
One and only Hov
So when the story is told let it be said I refuse to fold
I stood for the best, I owed no debt
I represent the hood til my dying breath
I took a pay cut to become an exec
And even though these niggas talk greasy bout me
Ask these niggas how they 'gon eat without me
Ask these niggas if they want stats involved
And even if they don't like me, they respect the God
I'm hustler's poster child, I'm supposed to style
I ain't got nothing to prove, I'm supposed to smile
I ain't insecure, I'm vested in a piece of Carol's Daughter
I'm in Sephora
Bricks are insignificant to him
Take your baby money and burn, T-Ha
I got Warhols on my hall's wall
I'm so sophisticatedly hood, S. Carter cashmere premium goods
Thousand dollars for the sneaks
G4 back and forth to my floor seats
Anything you aspire, to acquire I got
Any gun you say, you fired
I shot Any type of paraphernalia, I am the seller
I guess you're saying that's how I started Roc-A-Fella
Feds all fed up
DEA can't tell the dirty money from a Rocawear sweater
Oh never that, oh never that
I'm in the twelve-step program
I ain't touched drugs in so long I'm a sober man
I'm clean as a whistle, official
Got a way, I'm the King of all kings, it's official
I'm a hustler's hustler
A gangster's gangster
Your favorite, ain't I
Ain't I, ain't I, ain't I
Oh
I keep you fresher than the next chick
No need for you to ever sweat the next chick
With speed, I make the best chick see the exit indeed
You get the keys to the Lexus, no driver
You got your own 2001 to ride in
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me

All them collects have me vexed, but when you come home

Holdin' this grip, cocked the En Glee-Kay and shit

Swear to God I just touched down
All around the world.. (same song)
A-T-L (same song)
Real-adelphia.. dude it's all around the world
London, England, South of France
I'm a Tokyo Giant like Ichiro, I am
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Spot me the hotel, the Cap', or Capri
Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like "Oui"
Your man'll stand manta ray, handlin' a steak
Five-nine, fine wine, fine dine, either that
Or I'm mixin' in Switzerland, tryin' to buy time
Ballin' out in Bali when it's gorgeous out in Cali
Brunchin' at the 4 Seasons, off the heezy
Nigga back to the books to the rhymes that took me
All around the world.. (same song)
Brooklyn bombers (same song)
Detroit players (same song)
Chi-Town.. all around the world
Said it's all love, Shore Club, M-I-A
Party at bungalow eight, when I stay
Pool look like a hundred Beyonce's
Come and Talk to Me, mami in the Yves Saint
Laurent, I hope, she ain't too young
Only twenty-one and older let another nigga mold her
I'm just tryin' to show her how a baller and a roller
Sleep one place, tell the pilot to keep the engine
Runnin', then I wake up in Martha's Vineyard
St. Bart's this year, I think I'm gon' spend Christmas
Reminiscin' 'bout the time my mom couldn't spend Christmas
Now I'm gon' send her on her own little wish list
Anywhere in the world, anywhere for my girl
Forever my lady, blind crippled and crazy
All around the world
Said it ain't where you from yo it's where you at
Real niggas out in Brooklyn, some niggas don't clap
It's real killers out in Cali, some niggas just act
Hollywood like they out the hood, it's all to the good
Real players in the D-Twa, some of them throwed
Slackin' on they mackin', rest haven for hoes
Disciplined Gangsters, come on Charlie I know
Shit, it ain't about your city or borough
It's 'bout if you really as thorough
And if you are, holla at your boy
I put my hand on my heart, that means I feel you
Real recognize real and you lookin' familiar
I'm a Bed-Stuy nigga but I do it to death
I promise I'm in St. Thomas homie eatin' at Chef's
One-twelve, A-T-L, the sun up yet?
We gon' take you all around the world.. it's the same song (same song)
Everywhere (same song)
It's the same song (same song)
We gon' take you all around the world.. same song (same song)
Same song (same song)
Same song (same song)

All I need in this world of sin

When I'm off in the club she fit right in my shoe (wooo!)
Gotta switch her to my waist, just in case (uh huh)
A clown wanna flip, gotta reach for my bitch
Wanna act out a movie, I could give you a clip (buck!)
But no ad-libbin', nigga, stick to the script
Now all, I, need is a high-priced lawyer
And they comin' to court too, I thought you knew
Can't even steal on a nigga, muh'fuckas will sue
When I'm surrounded by squeal muh'fuckas like you?
But real niggas don't fret 'cause the number one crew
All I need...
Rocawear... (check)

Listen, the cream too long, my team too strong
Bleek is too hot, Beans is gone
Y'all niggas in the crosshair, the beams is on (see y'all)
Y'all whole block deserted, y'all fiends are gone (bye bye!)
Any given Sunday gunplay's optional
However niggas want it like Soul II Soul (however do you waant it?)
Whoever got hops get blocked, go to the hole
Left hand'll lean 'em like a little past six
Now run along wit'cha little-ass hits
Read my rap sheet, nigga: three classics!
Shut your bumba', I got A-Rod numbers
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk
When I blast the pump
I leave you relaxed in the hospital, lookin' at M*A*S*H for months
Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk
And I flee scot-free and pee-pee on the steps
We've got no respect, no law or governin'
Why you fuckin' with him?
Matter fact, why you fuckin' with them?
All y'all need is the R-O-C, baby
All I need...
Rocawear... (check)

Roc-A-Fella Records
Freeway, Oschino and Sparks, Chris and Neef
(All I need)
Mickey and Mallory
M-Extra Money, ha
Clue! Rell
Uh, yeah
You mess around with known assassins, known for blastin' Known for carrying plastic pistols, chrome-attached
And known for grossing the most
I'm down for whatever
Jigga man, ya heard
Jay Z, ya heard
Hova, ya heard
Roc-A-Fella, ya heard
Sigel-Sigel, ya heard
Now everybody wanna rhyme like Hov
Cause I rhyme like I be rhymin' in the Rov'
My minds like the diamonds, I'll blind you at them shows
I don't shine, I glow
Don't I? Kill niggas won't I?
My per-sona, hustler turned rapper, smell a crack aroma
Send shots like toma! in any language
Leave niggas in a coma when I'm bangin' that Fifth
Get chicks lit off Coronas and bamboo spliffs
And get the camcorder to camcord their hand movements
And for what? ya'll actin' like ya'll better than Hov
Ya'll cats should open up on the Letterman show
Cats is funny
All I do is get money and ya'll shit sound funny to me
Everybody's talkin' like they better than Hov
But that shit's real funny to me
Jigga man, ya heard
D.A. act like he had a starvin' for Jay
If they lock me in a cage, yo party away
Still got millions buried in the sock drawer
Still holdin' my own on the corner nigga
What can't kill me can only make me stronger, nigga
And when I get back home
Get your ass up out the throne
Everything's back to the way shit was
I could drop a straight dud, I'mma stay up
Niggas tryin' to break my will
You know that ain't my steel
You're dealin' with a higher power
Do 'em like Dwight Eisenhower
My life can move a thousand miles an hour
Reflect me folks
As my world turns like the wheels on a bicycle spoke
It's much deeper than a soap, it's a constant drama series
All they see is money, they want me to blind the jury
All this bullshit can make the mind weary
The sun shall shine clearly
You know what I do?
Flow sicker on every record, watch shine
Glock nine nigga, heavy necklace
Watch mine, I'm about to make niggas very jealous
Ice in every letter
With this CEO of the Coke on Broadway
Never heard so many joints from one man
I make chickens bounce, I make the gun jam
Of cocaine raw, rip ya whole brain off
Make it real easy to lift ya chain off
BK style, see Jay? How?
We don't play fair, we play foul
Go ahead, stand there, we spray crowds
Jigga, huh
Jigga, what
Jigga-Jigga, huh
Jigga, what
Jigga-Jigga, huh
Jigga, huh
Jigga, what
Jigga-Jigga, huh
Jigga, what
I'm a monster, I sleep whole winters; wake up and spit summers
Ghetto nigga, puttin' up Will Smith numbers
Got money for 6's and Hummers, chickens among us
We just tryin' not to let this bullshit become us
(Once again it's the life, yes)
I don't know why, I.. get so high oh
(It's intoxicating man, y'all don't know why you do what you do)
The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My women-friends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
Man, my brother hustled so, naturally
Up next was me, but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends, still I play
The starring role in "Hovito's Way"
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)
But every time I felt "That was that", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (OH NO!)
I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top up like a toupée, mix the water with the soda
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)
But every time I felt "That was that", it called me right back
Man, it called me right back (OH NO!)
I never felt more alive than riding shotgun
In Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need -
What the game did to my pulse - with no results
The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I can't explain why I just love to get high
Drink, "life!" smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dying young, leaving a good-looking corpse
Of course...
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (OH NO!)
But every time I felt "That was that", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (OH NO!)
Once again its the life
Once I again its the life
(OH NO! I don't know why, I...
Get so high oh
Get so high oh
Get so high, high off the life)
The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My womenfriends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
My brother hustled so - naturally -
Up next was me...but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends! yet still I play
The starring role in "Hovito's Way"
"In the valley of my world
You'll be my only girl"
Once again it's the life, Oh no!
"In the valley of my world
You'll be my only girl"
Once again it's the life, Oh no!
I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Peel the top up like a toupée
Turn the pot up, make a soufflé
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your 2-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say "hooray" to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing
I'm like Pookie in New Jack, cleaned up with the roof back
On the other side of the tracks I produce crack
Still a fiend no less, for the green i just
Brings out my worse, just the gift and the curse
No one said it would be easy, nigga livin is work
It's hard to not style in the Arnage, or fuck the Arnage
When the Benz doors lift up from the floor
And every night fake willies wanna match ya ball
It's the life
Yeezy, Hova, Yeezy
Yeezy Yeezy, Hova, hold up
You either love me or leave me alone
Oh, they want me to fall (fall)
They want me to drop (drop)
They want me to stop (stop)
They want me to go (go)
I'm already gone (already)
I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Oh (oh), they want me to fall (fall)

These niggas want me to go, don’t they know that I'm gone
They know I'm space shuttle level, they need oxyg-g-g-gen
Don't they know that they boring? Don’t they know that I yawn?
Only time they exciting is when they mentioning Shawn
Seen Single White Female when she dyed her hair blonde?
Sometimes I look at these rappers, the movie remind me of them
Somebody turn these boys off, don't they know that I'm on
Can't they see that it's foolish to try and kill me with songs
What the fuck are they Lauryn, they killing me softly
You talk me to death, only thing you do is talk
I open the door for them, what else can I do
These niggas want me to walk for them
Somebody talk to them before I go off on them
Oh, they want me to fall (fall)
Fall from the top (top)
They want me to drop (drop)
They want me to go (go)
I'm already gone (already)
The shit that I'm on (hey)
I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
I taught 'em 'bout fishscale, they want me to fish for them
They want me to catch clean then cook up a dish for them
All of this just for them or they got a diss for him
They want me to disappear like it's gon' shift for them
They say that I'm in the way, they want me to sit for them
But what they admitting is they ain't got shit for him
And really the fact is, we not in the same bracket
Don't pay the same taxes, hang with the same bitches
So how am I in the way, what is it I'm missing?
Nigga I been missing, nigga I been gone
The shit that you just witnessing I been on
And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it
Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it
Now these niggas is mad, oh, they call me a Camel
But I mastered the drought, what the fuck I'm an animal
Fall from the top (top)
They want me to drop (drop)
They want me to stop (stop)
They want me to go (go)
I'm already gone (already)
I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
Hey, I'm already home
I'm in The Hall already, on the wall already
On another level, on another plane already
Niggas compare me to Biggie and Pac already (already)
Like I'm gone already
If y'all can't already see
I ain't worried about y'all 'cause I'm already me (already)
Yeah, do you already, enough with the complaining
Boo-hoo's already, eat food already
Ain't nothing given you gotta claim your shoes already
Yeah, so in summation, I don't know who you racing
I'm already at the finish line with the flag waving
Come on
Oh, they want me to fall (fall)
Fall from the top (top)
They want me to drop (drop)
They want me to stop (stop)
They want me to go (go)
I'm already gone (already)

The shit that I'm on (already)
Hey, I'm already home
What, tssh, y'all, what
Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi
Cutie, smelling like Miyake, half-Philippine thing
For now, let's call her Suki, got me, this booty banging
Tits Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ
Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry, watch me
Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early
'Cause who's getting played is not me
Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me"
I said maturely, "You right
But better safe than sorry, before the lovebirds
Can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story
To make sure that you one of a kind
And you deserve to be my Sunshine"
I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh)
Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)
A year gone, and she seeing things most chicks only
Hear in songs (uh-huh), keep in gear phenom
Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm (that's right)
Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm
Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep (uh-huh)
Just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said
I ain't deaf nor blind, niggas stressing
Hating 'cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me
We chose each other, you acting like you chose me
They oppose you then, they oppose me
We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery
Double cross you they got to triple cross me
(I'm thinking that's the way it's supposed to be) Uh-huh
(One more thing:
If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho'
(She replied, eyes open wide) Uhhhh
(Put that on everything?) I put that on my life
(Right)
Touch me with, a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh)
Touch me with, a smile of gold (uhh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)
If I needed would you, give me your kidneys? (Uhh, uhh, fo' sho')
Catch a case, you catch it with me? (Mmm, fo' sho')
Pawn your jewelry to come get me? (You better know)
Catch me with a chick, forgive me? (Uhh, now that, I don't know)
They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail? (Uh-huh)
They try to frame me, will you be there, 'til the truth prevail? (uhh)
(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
That you was, throwin' rocks, on the roof at 12, nigga?)
This is the truth I shall, 'til the loot gets frail
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
Me and you balling, from the Heavens, or the Hell
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm falling myself
Now picture me leaving you in this cold world, rolling for delf
It's me and you in this old girl, we taking the belt
Just continue to be my sunshine, uhh
I can't go a day without my sunshine (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? uhh)
Touch me with, a smile of gold (yeah)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, ahh-haaa
London bridges are falling down
Not bridges but britches when Jigga’s in town
Lady, show me your knickers
Run from the night or we end up in The Sun
I’m just taking the piss — unless you’re gonna do it
Oh Nelly’s gone so Makaveli
Bring two packs of condoms when you come to the tele
If diamond’s are a girls’ best friend, my crew
We like to invite you to
Our family –
Jewelry I mean ‘cause my jewels currently is being guarded by the queen
Then came the dawn, and
I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all, that's all baby
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never, felt that before
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never, felt that before
But there's always; that's all, that's all baby
Uhh, uhh!
This is the shit you dream about with the homies steaming out
Back-to-back, backing them Bimmers out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playing this Marvin
But that's too far away, niggas are starving
I got dreams of bagging snidd-ow, the size of pillows
I see pies every time my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those
I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
Uh, uhhhh!
Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there
It's not quite near, and it's not like we're
Professionals, moving the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! Got a connect? No!
Who in the F knows how to be successful
Need a Personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, it's all in the stars
'Cause y'all ain't fucking with me! The ironies are
At all costs better avoid these bars
Get set, let's go, get out the car
Going in circles it's a vicious cycle
Wake up Muttley, you're dreaming again
Your own reality show, the season begins
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
(I'm just American dreamin')
(American dreamin')
But there's always, that's all, that's all baby
Step one in this process: scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince them that you're not from the precinct
Please speak slow 'cause he no speaky no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
And your money is straight, he's going to give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, I wish you well - hold up
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am I? I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers is scheming
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time
I'm, American dreamin'
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
Oh no-oh, I never gave up no way
I never felt that before
(I'm just American dreamin')
I never felt that before
(American dreamin')
But there's always, that's all, that's all baby
American dreamin'
And you say New York City
Uh-huh
Put your hands together
Young!
Uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yes! (Yes!)
Era of the hustlers, uh
The world is my custies
New Rich Porter
The way I flip quarters
Front on all these other rap artists, but me
Momma was a mink wearer, papa ran numbers
Way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill
Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining
40 below Timbs on, getting my M's on
My best friend's gone
I seen bad days, still find songs that I hear him on
Getting my Mary J. Blige Reminisce on
So I get on that fly shit I been on
Spin on corners in Enzo with rims on
But for info, puffing on Endo-Nesia
Give me amnesia
I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga
I want the sky
The world when I'm done
Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, uh
Sixes kit it up, man I did it up, done
A list of hits next to all my names
I came
(Woo!) uh-huh (geah)
I want the sky baby
I want the sky baby
And auction off all my cars
Don't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed the Beamer
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardinia
Billie Jean, the goddamn boy ain't mine
And the Roc break up, had the people losing hope
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's
Rose gold, Rosé flow, I'm okay though
What don't kill me makes stronger than before so
Here we go and I'm not Domino
When it all falls down, I'm like Kanye's jaw
I might break but I don't fold, 'til I hold the sky in my hand
Yeah, that's my goal
And then I bid you Freddy Adu
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the fu-ture, ture
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle
My name will be viewed such
I want the sky baby
Fucked up, right? Ha, I know
I know what y'all niggas asking yourself
Is he gon' ever fall off?
No...
A lot of speculation
On the monies I've made, honies I've slayed
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct
Is it true he stayed in beef and slept with a TEC?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck
But only your single going gold?
If Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for a O?
For the millionth time asking me questions like Wendy Williams
Harassing me, then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
While I'm looking at my Rol', ice spinning on my sleeve
Latinos in Chevys, down by Pico with Frederico
I answer all y'all questions but then y'all got to go
Now the question I ask you is, "How bad you wanna know?"
(A million) Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh
(A million) How we do, what?
(A million) Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh
(A million) How we do? Ugh!
'98, Preemo remix, and ain't nothing different
I don't know what the hell, niggas been sniffing
Jigga still dipping, chrome on the whips and
Still in the game, nigga, hooked like glue
I'm a crook like you
What could I do? Knowin I'm supposed to style
I'm the hustler's poster child, rock lizards and cro-codile
Live ironic and what-not
Put all that ice on the face of a watch just to make it hot
Now you see me on them stages, rocks in the air
MAC double one, nigga, I'm troublesome
All I got for chicks hard dick and bubble gum
Flip bricks like Fred, Barney Rubble and them
It's the Roc-A-Fella clique, what's fucking with them?
Not a damn thang nigga, we doing our damn thing
BLAOW!!!
(A million) Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh
(A million) How we do, come on
(A million)
Sounds so beautiful, don't you agree, ladies and gentlemen?
Ha! Well they call me Jay-Hova 'cause the flow is religious
And ever since I was 16, I was holding digits
I'm seeing this industry clearer
As if I had coke in the trunk and cops in the rear mirror
I slow-flows y'all to death
The flow be Ay, Bendito
For the mamis I hable español, poquito
Oh Este, I got timing like a segue
Now holla back, baby!
Uh-huh-huh, Jay-Z, you motherfucking right
In the darkest nights let off my gun for light
To guide y'all through, show you how it's done
I'm The Question and The Answer like Iverson
Jets be private ones, no gate to lift
Bang with this, wake up with one in your brain
And the cocaine flow's straight numbing your pain
This ain't your speed, young mayne, run in your lane
So I can come through doing a hundred and change
I put one in your frame—picture that
Who's running the game? Let's get to that
I guess we one and the same
A million and one... once again
Novacane flow, ho, you ain't know
Like a baller in an Impala, Jigga remain low
'Til the next time, nigga
What the hell...what the hell...
Check check check check it out
What the hell...what the hell...
People know me on these streets player, I ain't new
Suprise, what I do is already legalized
Analyze what I toss across, ain't no love lost
Flow, you gotta pay a little more now
It's platinum, now a days we put the gold down
We stepped it up, y'all don't ever want a showdown
These days I mellowed out, see success make a fella content
Uh-huh, you know, this rap star, Papi Chulo
Jay-Z, Hugo, of course player you lost player
I know you rappers wanna see me fail
But quick to see a 600SEL V-12
Live wit it, y'all got dough to get get it
I got mine, your little bit of money couldn't stop mine
Your block time, too hot, too many hands in your pie
Seventy thirty, the nigga you work for work for me
Bottom line
People know me on these streets and the towns I been through
Lookin at me, stay focused, I'm givin em straight poker suprise
Analyze how I floss of course, ain't no love lost
We be the Bronx to BK'lyn, togethor we about a ton or better
On the way in, we rhyme related, very underestimated
That's why I'm winnin in this world of sins
Steady grinnin, money boss spendin
Distant from dirty women, Lord, I'm quite influencial
Preachin my words and don't know what you owe
It shows you wanna be me, but won't show it
I had a ten year run, hey I can't complain
Took the next step see, from Coke to Pepsi
From the bx weed, ridin the south beach on jet-ski
Play to survive, you ain't live you just livin
You breathin a good one, but where I'm from, y'all forbidden
Come around, bad decision, you rather be in prison
Ain't' no duckin what I'm deliverin won't be forgivin in
You gotta walk toward the light, everything is aiight
I make sure everything you endure stays tight
Big (*boom*) Lord Tariq, Jay-Z, outta sight
I spend nights on corners, see the crack, cop my first Mac
No longer scared to pump what y'all pump, now I burst back
It hurts that, don't seem C.R.E.A.M can make my purse fat
Without the benefits of a doubt, I hit the hearst black
But curse that, tryin to see Nas was your worst match
Am I greedy? Like Amin Idi see me
In a fly Salinii gimme frames and the beanie
I flip my loot twice a week on the most trifest streets
You got no right to eat by the laws of life you keep
Ain't no love lost, none taken, none givin'
Stressin how I'm livin it, thinkin when my loot first came
Look what I did with it, bought my click glaciers
Copped a live croc, chopped it up, hit my block off
I still put out the street flavor
But watch that kid right there, a bulge in his night wear
Awoke me up the ways I used to be in my heist years
Bubble eye small fry loaded four five
Just thirstin for some person with shine to just walk by
Now that I can see the 360, now that its me thats jiggy
Them cooly heads they wanna stick me, whoa
Uh huh yea, yeah
Duro!
Uh, uh, uh like dat yeah
Come on bring the chorus in
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I’d do a bid, loose a rib, bust a cap, trust in that
Run up to heaven doors, exchange my life for yours
Leave a steak out the door, mi casa, su casa
Just remember to turn the lights off in the hall
My brother from another pop, minus one shot
We Nino and Gee Money, man, we all we got
From the stoop to the big dudes, stoppin' us from playin' hoops
And us getting mad, throwing rocks off the roof
Straight thuggin' man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we're young execs
My nigga Dame, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Ty
My nigga High, my nigga Gotti
We embody all that’s right with the world
No matter how pretty she is, you never liking my girl
That's how we run, when you ain’t around
I'll spank ya son, keep him in line
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom, for your wisdom, for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was wheezin'
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that’s mine
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Check it out, uh, uh
Dear nephews, I’m writing' this with no pen or a pad
And I’m signing it, ya uncle, ya best friend, and ya dad
Don't look back if you fall and you’re feeling bad
I’m right there from your cut to when you peelin' the scab
If it comes a time when you ain’t feelin' your real dad
Don’t follow no nigga, that's ho shit man
The world is yours, some girls are nice some girls are whores
Standing back from situations gives you the perfect view
Bite your tongue for no one and whatever is said
Take it how they want, a closed mouth don't get fed
You know my number when it’s code red
You're my nephew, fuck it we get it on my lil nigga
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For one kiss, everything
Yes I'd do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
Uh huh, uh huh
Turn my headphones up
Hip-hop y'all
Turn my headphones up
Be high y'all
Turn the headphones up
Jigga man huh
Jigga man huh
You know what I do
I remove your roof homie let the sun shine in
Really a thirty six without the gun I'm thin
Ignorant bats I'm taking y'all back to day one
Well here's the shock of your life the Glock not the mic
How you gonna talk about MCs on my heel
I just copped that thing homie, the chrome wheels
Both arms is chunky, the sleeves on chill
Any given time's a hundred g's in your grill
He's alright, but he's not real
Love affair for war, hug, squeeze that steel
You gotta flow that's cool with me
You gotta little dough that's cool with me
You gotta little car little jewelry
You know the wrist's frostbit minus two degrees
About as blue as the sea the way I maneuver the beat
Can't see his eyes who could it be?
Then I skated to four, 'fore I went on tour
Came back and it's plain
Rappers ain't rapping the same
Their flow they jacking my slang
I seen the same shit happen to Kane
Three cuts in your eyebrows trying to wild out
The game is mine I'll never foul out
Y'all just better hope I gracefully bow out
You know I'm heavy on your mind
You know it's annoying the fact
This wristband over my forearm, the Jordan of rap
Twenty three of MCs, what y'all recording is crap
Yeah, yeah, Jigga man huh
Yeah yeah, I come through getting money, sitting on twenties
Hot shell all that them niggas can get from me
Cocktails thrown in your living room, boom
I'm so confrontational
They should have never let me out on probation yo
I took a step back I viewed myself
See where my head was at
It's where that dough is homie I gotta get that
Some died but left stacks
Me I balled right, and on top of that I'm dog nice
Jigga been cold as fuck before ice
You know me, you know me
Yeah, poppin' Chrissy
Buck sixty through the gothic city
Who do you trust (sirens) got to get him
Of my CDs, 'Pac, and Biggie
'Face and Juvie, looking at her face, she cutie
Perfectly, this perfect booty
She wanna hear Ma$e
I pull up to the store in front of Sam Goody
I hop out, I throw on my hoodie
I don't hate, chick carried work for me from state to state
It's the least I could do
Order LL too
I put the car in drive baby let's go
Little party bullshit me off guard? not hardly full clip
This chicks the black barbie, my car be
In the robbery, p-o-r-t
I'm a heartbeat away from deep thinking
Close my eyes can you see me thinking?
Can you see the chick panicking when she see how we drinking
Mind full of intoxicants my thoughts shadow boxing

I very often think about you and the Beatles, not because the music sounds alike, but because they were real envelope-pushers, you know, they were always about what's next, telling the audience. They were not afraid to be ahead of their audience, and I feel like that's what you try to do. I mean, this album is a lot about arts, and things that kids not necessarily would be interested in.
The the truth is, as far as hip-hop and the arts, we were like cousins, you know. If you think about those days with Fab Five Freddy was with Madonna and Basquiat and everything. You know, we all went to those clubs--that’s when hip hop was more underground. The arts and hip-hop really partied together, but when arts started becoming part of the gallery it was this separation. But we pretty much came up together.
You have a song on your record called “Tom Ford.” I'm sure some people are thinking, why is he on some white, gay designer’s dick? What’s going on there?
Pause.
Let me clarify that: I am not...[Laughs]
I meant that metaphorically. But the line that I think says alot, you say, “I don’t pop molly, I rock Tom Ford.” You know, everybody else is talking about doing ecstasy, and you’re, “I don’t do that; I get shit done. I’m in business.”
Man, I’m just gonna take you around with me--
To explain your shit?
It could help you with Harry Belafonte. You had a feud. Show the picture. I mean, this is very bad what happened with the you and Harry because, I mean, look at look at this. He’s 86, and you’re 43? So he’s literally twice your age and it’s a draw.
He got on your case because he, I remember when they did this with Michael Jordan, you remember that, when they were saying to Michael Jordan: “You're the king of the negroes; get more involved, do more.” And, you know, that upset you, and I don't blame you for being upset.
Yeah, I just didn’t think it was the correct venue. If it was something, really like a real problem, you know, I'm not a very difficult to find, especially for someone of that stature. He can reach out to me and we can have a conversation we’ll do some good together. But, you know, I just thought that it was a bit of grandstanding to me, and I didn’t appreciate especially dragging my wife into it was a bit of a low blow--
I really like Bruce Springsteen.
Harry was on our show once. He was iconic, as he is, and I don't know if you ever saw this clip, but I wanted to get it for you. This is from a 1968 television special he did with Petula Clark, and this was a giant controversy in 1968 because she touched him. Show the clip to show you what I'm talking about. This is what people we upset about.
It’s kinda strange to have a conversation with like three people, like I'm ignoring y’all. I gotta make eye contact.
And they’re all gay, by the way.
Think of us as your backup group in waiting.
We’ll bring them in in a few minutes. You’re the first guest we’ve ever had who said that. Everyone else is like, “Fuck them.” They never even think about that.
Okay, so I was doing a little math and based on when your first album came out, you will be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in seven years.
Is it based on your first album?
Twenty five years from your first album. So in seven years you will be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I'm sure you'll be getting in first ballot unless there's some steroids--
I am not going!
You’re not going?
Nah, I’m just--
You’ll be going. Who would you like to induct you?
I cheated.
Let’s say he’s busy...
It’ll be all right. He owes me, he owes me a couple.
He owes me a couple.
I noticed that one of the talking points from conservatives after the Trayvon Martin trial was, why are we talking about this one tragedy when hundreds of black kids are being shot in Chicago. But over the weekend the Congressional Black Caucus did a two-day summit there, and they talked about this very issue the conservatives say they're never talking about. It was covered by NPR, MSNBC, Chicago media, C-SPAN, not Fox News. It seems like Fox News doesn't want to allow this fact in that they are actually talk--
What?
Concern trolling. It's, you know, saying, well you know shouldn't--don't worry about this thing, worry about this other thing, but you don't really care about the other thing you just wanna change the subject.
But I think over-policing is part of the problem. I mean, look at New York City and look at stop and frisk. I mean, policing in communities of color...I mean, I don't know, I can’t talk this better than you can, but I’m curious or your opinion, Jay Z--
I don’t really want to scare America, but the did the real problem is there's no middle class, right? So that the gap between have and have-nots is getting wider and wider.
Well, more jobs would be better than police. We won’t need police...
You need them both. I think, again, that’s a mistake. More jobs, those are going to help, but in the short term people want police stations. We are very unfair to people live in public housing. It was built badly, and they were put in there, but they deserve much more protection. The overwhelming majority of perfectly innocent, honest people--
I grew up in Marcy Projects; public housing was a temporary stop until you got yourself together, you moved on.
But even if you’re there for a couple years, you don’t want to be unpoliced. I'm all for that, low-income affordable rental housing was my number one goal--it's another thing that the Republicans, through the Tea Party, have absolutely cut off, unfortunately--
But I don’t think Stop-and-Frisk is a few bad apples. That’s an institutionalized racism that the NYPD has been conducting for years. They stopped more young black men than there are young black men in New York last year. I don’t seem them stopping and frisking Wall Street bankers--they have tons of cocaine on them.
You’re fighting a straw man. Of course Stop-and-Frisk, the way they’re doing it, is wrong, but answer is not fewer police. You hear people in the African-American community in New York complaining about Stop-and-Frisk, not get the cops outta here. They want the cops to be there and to be better behaved.
The murder rate is at a hundred year low.
Yeah, so I think you know inequality’s a big problem in a number of ways, but a lot of people were afraid when we went to the recession in 2008 that the progress we’d made on crime be reversed, and actually this is one social indicator that just keeps getting better.
And also black people are the primary victims of crime disproportionately, and that’s why they don’t want to see the police taken away. They want them improved but the answer is not to remove them.
If the murder rate is at a hundred year low, why do we need to do so much stopping and frisking; why do we need drones with the police department; why we're building a wall in Mexico. It begs a lot of questions. Why are we such a police state now?
Don't punish every city in New York for Mike Bloomberg's tics. The fact is--
And Ray Kelly’s, let’s don’t forget about Ray Kelly.
Obama wants him as the Homeland Security Czar.
It is not true in the whole country that police departments are doing that. The Los Angeles police have gotten a lot better since the days of--
But you’re from Massachusetts. We saw, when the Douchebag Brothers blew up the parade, somehow Boston had an army.
It was really weird: they shut down the whole city for a day.
And they had half-tracks and what looked like tanks. It didn't look like a police department that I ever saw.
We are an increasingly militarized society, and because these budgets are getting bigger and bigger, they need to justify those budgets. So sometimes you need to find crime--
But we didn’t want the police at Occupy Wall Street, I’ll tell you that.
But you were not victims of crime.
We were victims of brutality. There’s 125-page report that's put together by NYU law professors, documenting all the First Amendment violations conducted by the NYPD.

Every day a star is born (And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born (And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
I seen Mase do it, I seen Ye do it
X came through, caught lighter fluid
Still I came through it; clap for him!
But I’m the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin', I'll applaud him
If he keep going, pass the torch to him
50 came through like hurricanes do
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did "A Milli," 50 did a milli
Ye too, but what Em did was silly
His flow on "Renegade," fucking awesome
Applaud him!
Snoop dogged it, Nelly came down
The Face Mob kept it ghetto for the H-town
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches
Drake's up next, see what he do with it
Rule had a run, couple movie parts
T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts
What up, Jeezy? What it do?
Y’all remind me of us in early '92
Outkast landed, 3-thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run, standing ovay, ayyy
Every day, a star is born
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
And I am one of one
Can’t you see just how long my run?
My reign, Lulu's son-shine
Been a star since I was duckin' one-time
One time, give it up for him
To this corner office, it's so enormous
Hey, Prez Carter
Watch them get they Monica on all day
Hey, got so many different monikers but only one Jay
Some friends, some hoes
But, no, I goes nowhere, this Hov'
Every day a star is born (And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York City!)
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em! Hey
And could I be a star?
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the broad day light, go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the Ville
Got a deal, a real lifesaver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like Jada
I chill now, cop a little ice later
Flow so sick, thought he wrote the rap for him—no, sir!
The flow cold as the shoulders
Of gold-digging hoes when a broke nigga 'proaches
Told you I’m focused, man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in, and clap for 'em!
Every day, a star is born (And you say New York City!)
Yeah, hey, and clap for 'em!
Hey, hey, and clap for 'em!
Clap for 'em! Clap for 'em!
Uh-huh
It was all good just a week ago
Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
I had the money.. had the cars, the bitches
Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry..
And then my motherfuckin' niggas started snitchin'
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo, yo
Beatch!
Problems; I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Let him unlock doors off my keys
Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially
Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talkin' reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said: "Damn, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?"
He said: "Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home."
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
I said: "The world don't stop, I got to keep..keep on."
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
Can't be too safe, ‘cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side, when they catch a new case
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Seventeen and I'm holdin' on to around a mill'
I could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal
Had niggas thinkin' I was from uptown for real
I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30
Freezin' on them corners, still holdin' my crack
Lookin' up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to lettin' the dough stack
You tell them Feds I said: "I'm never going back"
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Funny what seven days can change
It was all good just a week ago
The lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things
All this after a week in the bing
I'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling
Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)
And your son gotta grow up, like, "This is my dad?"
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
It was all good just a week ago
Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitchin'
We was one step away from takin' this crack money
And recyclin' it through the ghettos
And buildin' back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitchin' on each other
I got partners doin' 15-20
Wouldn'ta been doin' SHIT
If you didn't snitch, beatch!
Just watch the game
And don't snitch
We'd sure go a lot whole further
Believe that baby
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the house mane
You know I got it
Got it goin' on
We got the money
Ain't got nuthin' to do with crime baby
But I'm recognizin'
You rat bastard!
A word from Hov
Last night I performed at the University of Arizona, I had a ball!! Through all the excitement and joking around (as well as the technical difficulties) I missed out on the opportunity to say something important..
I think concerts like this should happen more often. ( Outside of the one or 2 festivals a year or “Zootopia”) I’m putting that into the universe..next up Taylor Swift and Uncle Murda!!
Sorry I don’t “Tweet” (do I?) so this will have to do..
Love
When you think of Jay-Z, what comes to mind?
(Laughing)
It's Baby Thug!
Make my money, nigga!
Fuck what they all say
Niggas can't stop me with rumors, Im too strong
All day, socks exploding sweat pants pockets is bulging
My spot is rolling, drop the price of the coke and
Drove the competition out and let the doe flow in
The cops is closing in, I can do the time
But whats really on my mind, there ain't no ho's in the pen
I play the low and try to make it hard to find me
Feds still tryna build a case since 93
Yo, moves is made, Niggas is paid, that's just how it is
When my time is up, Ima be out but ima try to live
I'm eating day by day ain't nothing sweet about it
Act like you don't know what I'm saying and they'll read about it
Built for war like an armadillo
Smother your ass with 2 through the pillow
And here take these four hot things, I got things
That make niggas spin, put niggas in the wind
Where you never see niggas again
I bless a nigga with stitches, the thin type
Start off my day and I'm off and running and I miss my gun
I'm often blessed but not these days cause its no longer fun
I am way worse then a banger with 8 bullets left in the chamber
Can't imagine the danger, when you done got these bow ties angered
When strangers pissed me off, I got high to control it
Outside opposition , got stress on my mind
But I got inside opposition, coming from my own kind and they're blind
We walk in peace but don't provoke us, we ain't gon' run
Cause if it wasn't for that man, there be no controlling us
His body laid in red rum, twisted in broken poses
Blood puddle soaked in his clothes and it look like roses
Smelling Folgers and Moses couldn't save him
We leaving the way we came, As-salamu alaykum
Now greetings to the world

Voice of the one pon gully banking
Look behind you; I'm 'bout to pass you twice
Niggas can't get past my past
How you propose a deal with the perfect present?
Ain't no living person can test him
Only two resting in Heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
7 straight summers; critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it quite like I did it;
If you did, I done it before
You get it, I had it;
I got mad at it, I don't want it no more
And that comes from everything, from flippin' that raw
Flippin' whores, flippin' vocal cords
Young!
Young H.O., fresh from Italy
Trip financed by my best ability
Same one helped me in extra realty
For my mom, for my nephews, a bunch of lil' me's
Flip flop by Versace, hip-hop got me here
Music made me a millionaire, yeah
Multi for what's inside of here
Inside my heart, besides that, I'm smart
Took the best of both worlds minus the madness
Though controversy follows me everywhere I dock
Everything I hear I block
Out like the jealous clouds do the sun
Then I sit back and recline since my shine has shone
And then sure nuff bust out something foreign with the doors up
Maybe the lilac Porsche
The lavender Retriever
In Capri, somewhere foreign that you need your visa
Yup, Hovi's home; but it's like I never left, I had the global phone
Yup, yeah I stayed in touch
I heard y'all back home complaining, y'all complain too much
So hateful, bunch of dudes I put on out there acting so ungrateful
But daddy's home, and he brought the forty autie-matie chrome
For all the chatty-chatty y'all been doing
While y'all was running your mouth complaining about Summer Jam
I was in flip-flops in the South of France
See how it flip-flops with the number one station for hip-hop and r&b?
Even in my absence, my presence is felt
That gotta tell you I'm the king, dog, if nothing else
I'm on another continent, you still ain't content
I'm in the Mediterranean, you still ain't vent
Explain to me why I want to be you again
You can stunt like that when you own the whole place, though
This is Rich Porter, part two
You can stunt like that when you're rich before your debut
Money and the murder, rapper or the trapper
Either way I'm gon' serve ya
Shooters on my team... No really, I got shooters on my team
Juan or Deron
How you niggas want it, pick a arm
They call me Lucky Lefty...

자기 신발 끝내주는데
자기 돈 좀 많나봐
자기 스타일 진짜 멋있다
Geah, yeah
Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
Thirty odd years without having my cake up
So I'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here
Since we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair
Went from having shabby clothes, crossing over Abbey Road
I just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing life
See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
For the sins of a father
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter and a new beach chair
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Gun shots sing to these other guys
But lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying
Every day hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving out my space in this world of fly girls
Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls
Benzes round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind
Some said: "Hov', how you get so fly?"
I said: "From not being afraid to fall out the sky"
My physical's a shell so when I say farewell
My soul will find an even higher plane to dwell
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream
Intercut, the winner's cup
With winters rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice
So to map it out you must look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you, chica
In great shape like Heidi Klum, Maricón, I am on
Permanent vacay, life is but a beach chair
This song is like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print
A map for you to get back
I'll make a stink for you to think
I ink these verses full of prose
So you won't get conned out of two cent
My last will and testament I leave my heir
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave
I hear my angels sing
I hear my angels sing
Hit ya ass on the celly, 'cause I ain't got time
To be arguing with your ass, if you ain't really ready
You better look like Halle Berry... Or Beyoncé
Shit, then we getting married
I brought sand to the beach 'cause my beach is better
Left the house with 100 grand, ended up near broke
Don't get mad at me, I'm buying bucket after bucket
When it's gone I'm like "Fuck it"
Can't take this money with you
Burn this shit up like I'm Richard
Niggas asking "Is the oven on?"
It's the Roc in the building
Neeveen akh kuch chir paake rakh le

Saanbh ke rakh ni eh joban butari
Hun mud ke na aauni eh bahaar
Mundiya to bach ke rahi
Ma, I ain't gotta tell you, but it's ya boy Hov
From the U.S., you just lay down slow
Catch ya boy mingle in England, meddling in the Netherlands
We rebellious, we back home
Screaming, "Leave Iraq alone!"
But all my soldiers in the field, I will wish you safe return
But only love kills war, when will they learn?
It's International Hov, been having a flow
Before Bin Laden got Manhattan to blow
Raw we had it all day, Papi in the hallway
Cop one on consignment to give you more yay
Yea, but that's another stor-ay
But for now, mami, turn it around and let the boy play (Jay)
Nahi teri jehi Sohni koi naar

Uh, uh uh uh
It's big pimpin' baby (That's right)
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' about, "What's the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's "beep beep" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in and let's ride!
We doin' big pimpin', we spendin' cheese
We doin' big pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
Nigga, it's the big Southern rap impresario
Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it "buck"
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick, then back to the streets
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughin' it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up!

Let's describe a certain female
Let's describe a certain female
(Bitch) you know my name and the company I own
(Bitch) don't try to act like my track-record ain't known
(Bitch) you probably gotta couple CD's in your home
(Bitch) don't make me say it twice, you acting all up tight
All sidity like, like, like you ain't a (Bitch)
I ain't no ball player, you ain't gonna get pregnant and get
Before the neighbors take off to go to work
So just, take off your shirt, don't hit me with that church shit
(Bitch) I got a sister who schooled me to shit you chickens do
Tricking fools, got a whole Robin Givens crew that I kick it to
They be hipping dudes, how you chickens move, I be listening too
(Bitch, bitch, bitch)
Don't make me say it thrice, you acting all up tight
All sidity like, like you ain't a (Bitch)
You ain't no better cause you don't be fucking rappers
You only fuck with actors, you still getting fucked backwards
(Bitch) Unless you fucked a dude on his own merit
Let's describe a certain female
Let's describe a certain female
Let's describe a certain female
Say Jay-Z, why you gotta go and disrespect the women for, huh?
(Bitch) Sisters get respect, bitches get what they deserve
Sisters work hard, bitches work your nerves
Sisters hold you down, bitches hold you up
Sisters help you progress, bitches will slow you up
Sisters cook up a meal, play their role with the kids
Bitches in street with their nose in your biz
Sisters tell the truth, bitches tell lies
Sisters drive cars, bitches wanna ride
Sisters do it slow, bitches do it fast
Sisters do their dirt outside of where they live
Bitches have niggas all up in your crib
Sisters tell you quick "you better check your homie"
Sisters love Jay 'cause they know how Hov' is
B-I, what up?
Long as I got a voice, you got a voice my nigga
Yessir
BK stand up, Brooklyn throw your hands up
If you with me, lick a shot for Biggie
Chillin' in the spot in my B-Boy stance
Don't make this four-fifth kick like Bruce Lee roy pants
You know I'm smarter than Spock, for Leonard Nimoy fans
So this aluminum will foil your plans, that's how I'm doin' em man
I keep two in hand, in case I've been drinkin'
Seeing double, I got one for you and your twin
I got a nickel for your thoughts, make your blood trickle
Leave your smarts on the sidewalk, 'til the cops come and get you
I'm done playin' with you
The guns sprayin' with or without you
Make your body whistle without you, Young!
I'm still official without you
Still that nigga all the bitches whisper about, ooh
He's so terrific, his lyrics like it's about you
You can't tell me that everything he spits that it's not true
Took a lighter, left my name in the hall, Young!
Moved to the Marcy Projects 'round the time I was five
Had a great-grandmother in the heart of the 'Stuy
So on the Fourth of July, we would always stop by
Man, I ran through the bush, bought pounds from "the dreads"
Where niggas would snatch your pockets, leave your change on the floor
18 regime round then, Pink houses, Fort Greene niggas they ain't blend
Wasn't safe on the A train, D, G or the F
Decepticons, Lo-Life niggas snatch the Polo off your chest
East New York, Bushwick, fuck it, the whole BK
Nigga you better roll deep goin' through Coney Island
'cause it's one way out, nigga, one way in, nigga
Everywhere you go, Brooklyn's in the house, if you soft tuck your chain
The crooks is in the house, yes, the jooks is in route
The drama's on the way
Stare downs first, then the llamas gon' spray
But we respect real, you act like a sheep, you gon' be the next meal
Gotta get in where we fit in
Not rid the show and the kids is growing
Baby need new shoes, and you sitting on 22's
And you in the spot showing off like Terrell Owens
Hell I'm on this nigga
You better hold your ground, if you a straw house
Then the fours will blow you down and its back to the home town, yes!
When I was a young boy
My father took me into the city
He said, "Son, when you grow up
The beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?"
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade."
They say "they never really miss you til you dead or you gone"
So on that note, I'm leaving after the song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnes Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree, which makes me
A more sicker M.C. and my momma would claim
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare
I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matching my gear
Now I'm just scratching the surface cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?"
"Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade."
Now all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me, so
With that disdain in my membrane
Fuck the world, my defense came
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine
My gear is in and I'm in the in crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is loving me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
I'm getting ahead of myself, by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me moving this crack
Gimme a second, I swear
I will say about my rap career
Til '96 came, niggas I'm here
Good-bye
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?"
"Because one day I'll leave you
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade."
No two days are alike
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work, you thirst til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got em
And this was the stress I lived with till I decided
To try this rap shit for a living
I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made
Every sister I played
Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody's fault I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me
(If you can't respect that your whole perspective is wack
When I was a young boy
To see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them
Your demons, and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?"
A phantom to lead you in the summer
To join the black parade."
I'm who you see musically when you want it done hot
Comparin' you to me is a lesson in futility, STOP!
Don't worry about plagiarism, it'll take 'em years to bite it
But ya greatest fear is I don't write it
It just appears out of nowhere
Like the information obtained by a psychic
Like it or not I pay dues and expect to be paid back
Why the fuck should I freestyle I'm gettin' paid to rap
Tell ya God somebody's doin' a good job impersonatin' him
Jay-Hova, spittin' game from the Range Rover
What the fuck is y'all doin' in the third lane? GET OVER
Slow ya rota, I got it sewed up like a tailor
Relatively easy like Jerry Heller
Cream is cherry vanilla got chicks in the telly
Belly up, soundin' like Mahalia tryin' to tell y'all
Y'all know the style, burn the town down
And change the locale, I'm doin the same shit 'cept its legit
It's Jigga
Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit
Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit
They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit
Pimp Gotti get the dues in them double down
Like them kids with tips who tops down
Representin' bomb city on the bill block rockin' mics
Before they get a mil', I sold pills all night
The illest outta life got my mind on fate
'Cause even on tour nigga still ain't safe
I keep a tre eight on my left
Smoke a L for stress countin' dirt bag lex
Puff for now dunn east side represent with tons of guns
You keep it real where you from
'Cause where you at might put the dagger in yo' back
My mind totin', fuck 'em, duck 'em
Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit
They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit
Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit
Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit
They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit
Berg shit, word shit, I splurge with scrilla
Observe when you work spit bird shit killer
Not to be perturbed with, herb shit dealer
Can make me feel y'all fo' real ya tock tickin'
Bust a rapper bust a cap hustler stop flinchin'
You fresh off the corner calling dog shit brog shit
Soon as you feel that sog shit you be like oh shit (stoooooop)
Broke niggas resort the glass lookin'
Opposite the track ass whoopin'
Opposite the black class hooker the fat ass fooker
The past ain't never the last to teach lessons
Brew don't becomin' a preach I be blessin'
Lot of kids comin' out the wrong way like C-sections
Know the bro gone flow even if it cross shorts
Fuck weed cop coke 'cause the shit cost more
But niggas say I floss to much
But when I take it off and such they say I lost my touch
Those bitches like the money I wear
What its funny how they stare
Dumb bunnies with they cunnin' little glare
Shorty let me see the tail if its really that shittin'
My boy hit that shit now every body smitten
What I talkin 'bout mittens, fo' real
Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit
They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit
Got a twenty cart shorty better play that shit
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
Got twenty bag son better blaze that shit
They said I wasn't seeing twenty but I made that shit
Trip with a speed limit
Seat back, eager to bag a bitch that want a bag
It's best to born a bullet, she gon' fill you end wit
Short! Dawg! Bay area!!!
Uh! Ask my nigga Lebron!

No pause none of that shit, get off my dick!!!!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!! (It's too easy for me!)

C'mon! (Woooo!)
I could triple that in birds
Open your mind, you see the circus in the sky
I'm Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey with the pies
No matter how you slice it, I'm your motherfuckin' guy
And just like a b-boy with 360 waves
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige
Whether right or southpaw, whether pot or the jar
Whip it around, it still comes back hard
So easily do I W-H-I-P
My repetition with wristses'll bring the kilo bidness
Who slipped, became prisoners, trees taped to the visitors
Unnecessary commissary, boy, we live this shit
Niggas wanna bring the 80s back
Except I don't write on the wall
I write my name in the history books, hustlin' in the hall
Nah, I don't spin on my head
And I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it
I ain't talkin' about it, I'm livin' it
I'm gettin' it, straight gettin' it
Ge-ge-ge-get get get it boy
Don't waste your time fighting the life
Stay your course, and you'll understand
Get it boy
It's '87 state of mind that I'm in (mind that I'm in)
In my prime, so for that time, I'm Rakim (I'm Rakim)
If it wasn't for the crime that I was in
But I wouldn't be the guy who rhymes it is that I'm in (that I'm in)
No pain, no profit
P, I repeat if you show me where the pot is (pot is)
Cherry M3's with the top back (top back)
Red and green G's all on my hat
North Beach leathers, matching Gucci sweater
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain
Blame Reagan for making me into a monster
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra
Before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert
And I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it
I'm gettin' it, straight gettin' it
Ge-ge-ge-get get get it boy
Don't waste your time fighting the life
Get it boy
Uhh, push (push...)
Money over broads, you got it, fuck Bush
Chef (chef), guess what I cooked?
Baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books
Rockstar (rockstar), look
Way before the bars my picture was getting took
Try as they may, they couldn't get me on the hook, uhh
'Cause fishscale's in my veins like a Pisces
The Pyrex pot, rolled up my sleeves
Turn one into two like a Siamese twin
Never dying on my knees, last of a dying breed
I partied for a while now I'm back to the block
And I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it
I ain't talkin' about it, I'm livin' it
I'm gettin' it, straight gettin' it
Ge-ge-ge-get get get it boy
Stay your course, and you'll understand
Get it boy
Like Pepsi, that's a brand name
I stand behind it, I guarantee it
They know that, even if they don't know me anymore than they know the, the Chairman of General Mills... my man
"JAY-Z this," "JAY-Z that."
("JAY-Z won't hold my hand no more.")
"JAY-Z this," "JAY-Z that."
"JAY-Z that," "JAY-Z this."
Get off JAY-Z' dick!
What, y'all niggas get front page articles?
(This thing on?) JAY-Z, JAY-Z
(Check) In JAY-Z news
I understand what y'all tryin' to do
I brought the flutes this time, though (Check)
Unleash the flutes on 'em, Guru
Let's get to the proceedings preceding this evening
C'mon!
H-O-V-A
Naw, naw, don't be afraid
Y'all and your articles hock spit at Jay
Y'all from afar threw darts my way
What you thought, I would not have nothin' to say? Nope!
Y'all fell into the booby trap
And now you's can't leave
You opened the door, God, I'm at you annually
I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is
But you can't give cred to anything dude says
Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head
Shorty, it's time to wake up the dead
You sound a little naive in them articles that I read
H-O-V-A
The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
H-O-V-A
I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
Prophesizin' on your CD's and tapes
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
And this is with whom you want to place your faith?
When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line (It's real)
Donatin' proceeds off every ticket sold
When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?
Ain't I supposed to be absorbed in myself?
Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help
But they don't call me the dude to take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
These dudes is all politics, depositin' checks
They put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip (Yap, yap, yap)
And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype
'Cause the nigga wear a kufi, it don't mean that he bright
It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write (The fuck is you sayin'?)
Is it Oochie Wally Wally or is it One Mic?
Is it Black Girl Lost or shorty owe you for ice?
I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit
Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat
But I will not lose, for even in defeat
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens up for me
When the grass is cut, the snakes will show
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that, though (Ha ha)
Savin' me the hassle of speakin' to half of these assholes
My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history
Who you know flow vicious as me?
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov'
I get the spoils 'cause the victor is me (Me, nigga!)
You street dreamin', all y'all niggas livin' through me
I gave you life when niggas was forgettin' you emcee
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me
You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee
And the little homie Jungle is a garden to me
What's the problem, B? You not as hard as me, nigga
Hard as we, nigga, R-O-C, nigga
That's why they follow me
You want war, then this war's gon' be, nigga
H-O-V-A
The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
H-O-V-A
I got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
H-O-V-A
The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
H-O-V-A
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ugh, right, right, right
Right, right, right, right
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Momma loved me, Pop left me
Mickey fed me, Annie dressed me
Eric fought me, made me tougher
Love you for that, my nigga; no matter what, bruh
Marcy raised me, and whether right or wrong
Streets gave me all I write in this song
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up
East Trenton grew me, had me skipping school
Momma raised me; Pop, I miss you
God, help me forgive him; I got some issues
Mickey cleaned my ears, Annie shampooed my hair
Eric was fly... Shit, I used to steal his gear
I was the baby boy; I could do no wrong
Years going past fast; let's move along
Kitchen table: that's where I honed my skills
Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee
Clark sought me out, Dame believed
Primo laced me; Ski did too
Reasonable Doubt classic, shoulda went triple
Momma loved me, Pop left me
Grandma dressed me, plus she fed me
Banana pudding was in the hood then
Puffing on Ls, drinking pink Champale
Ty rolled with a nigga, V.A. spot
Tone, Mike 'Zo and them niggas, V.A.'s locked
Biggs fucked with a nigga, what's up Hoff'?
Bee-High hated the fact I put rap to the back
Money pouring in, clientele growing now
Birth of my first nephew; time to slow it down
October 21st: Lavelle came to the world
Followed by three more boys and then a baby girl
Momma loved me; Ti-Ti, Uncle Jay...
Loves you to death; won't let no trouble come your way
He's gone 'til November, how can I not remember?
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me, chased, cuffed, and subdued me
Talked to me rudely 'cause I'm young, rich, and I'm Black
And living a movie, not living by rules
Bleek, you're still with me, nigga, what did I say?
Beans, I ain't trying to change you, just give you some game
To make the transition from the street to the fame
My momma loves me...
Everything, everything this my only single thing
Everything I hear is my answer
I never hear that, I be in the posse
Never seen a ceiling in my whole life
Everything I seen, everything is rotten
Never sit in silence, innocent is Carter
Innocent we seek them
I and say we see them
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka
Boom shakalaka, boom shakalaka
Everything in shaka, everything in faka
Everything in shaka, everything in faka
I got bloodlines in Benin, that explains the voodoo
And thank the heavens for BB, her Creole roots run deeply
'Cause we family
We, we, we, family
'Cause more than ever we gon' have to stick together, feel me?
Was out in Havana when that had that banned forever, feel me?
Fuck embargoes, I'm a narco
Colombian ties, shout out to Dapo
OG Juan also
'Cause we family
Feel me?
Lagos, all the barrios 'round me, feel me?
We, we, we, family
Viet Cong never done shit to me, feel me?
I'm out in the art clubs in London sipping tea, feel me?
I'm out in Michelangelos in FTs
'Cause we family
We, we, we, family, feel me?
Yes! It's the collection!
It's ya boy S. Dot
Yes! I'ma take this time out to talk to you about The Black Album real quick
It's a prequel to all my... uh.. all my albums
It's the activities leading up to my first album in '96
It's like the book ends for the whole career... you know
We gon' take it all the way back
It's a time peat circa '88 to '94, maybe 95'
All the things that lead to songs like Friend or Foe or D'Evils you know what I'm saying?
You know all those activities you know what I'm saying? Yeah
It's ya boy Hov!
The game is all wrong, business niggas is snitching and it's okay..
We gotta put back the integrity back in music man
You know what I'm saying?
Check it out!
There's rules to this shit, consult the OGs
Before you dudes make one move on the strip
Before you move your lip, take the tool off your hip
I'll show you how to do this shit
I'll tell you what type of car to buy
What type of shoes to get
You gotta treat her right if she gon' mule your shit
Do you know the type of damage love could do
If she feels she's getting taken advantage of? Ouu!
Standing up like a down chick suppose to?
Here I'll coach you, Young ain't fake like most dudes
Young move weight like Cool J's trainer's a no brainer
And don't be wearing no vest with no banger
That just makes you a target
Young used to run the block, now I corner the market
'86 your bullshit, man get smart kid
But you ain't want to do no small bid
Incarcerated with the hard heads, acting like you hard head
That's all dead, get yourself the hog's head
Cheese, we could all get, R.S.V.P
Man we used to play dolls here
Wet niggas with the faucet, come through get your car ran
'Til I became one, now I got linen in the closet
I got the blueprint, you just gotta follow it
Rule number one, real niggas never gossip
Rule number two, own The Black Album you gotta cop it
Yeah man, we just gon' bring it back to the game man
Black Album, S Dot
It's the collection
First non athlete with a shoe
I know you love me, you just don't know how to tell me
It's all good though, I love y'all too
It's ya boy, Guru, fade it
So I had to memorize these rhymes until I got home
You understand? You know, once you memorize a sentence
It's like an exercise
Y'all niggas can't be serious right now
I'm the all time heavyweight champion of flowers
I'm leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now:
Best flow, most consistent, realest stories
Most charisma, I set the most trends
And my interviews are hotter! Holla!
I jog in the graveyard, spar in the same ring
That was housed by the building where Malcolm X was slain
Run suicide drills over and over
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
That's why they call me "Hova"
I'm far from being God, but I work goddamn hard
I wake up the birds so when the nerds asleep
I am focused, man, and I'm not afraid of death
And I'm going all out, I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (run), pull up in a drop (pull up)
I keep jacks jumping, thirty six sets
The ghetto's Billy Blanks, I show you niggas what pain is
Maintain your stamina, Hov will damage ya
Spot you two rhymes, y'all niggas is amateurs
The fifth, a dead lift if niggas don't want to get shot
No need to hit the showers, the spit from the fifth leave you wet
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
(and) four, breathe easy...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
One, two, three, four, breathe easy
Suckers, get your weight up, not your hate up
Jigga man is diesel when I lift the eight up
Y'all ain't ready to workout with the boy
Your flow is brain on drugs, mines is rap on steroids
I lift every voice when I sing, my ability
Make yours look like an exercise in futility
Bring your squad, biceps, triceps, and quads
Y'all ain't real, that's y'all Achilles' heel
Same routine when you see me you know the drill
I spot ya, I lift the weight of the watch
Off your arm, remain nice and calm
Put down your things, Trinidad of the game
Know my way around your ring
It sounds like the same old thing
R-O-C is the strongest team, fuckers
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy...
One, two, three, four, breathe easy
Aye, Purse, rack 'em up, man
Bet the same thing
Ay, yo, I got next, man
Yo, you got the money, man? You ass bettin' ass, nigga
The shit is right downstairs in the trunk
Don't trip; we parked right behind each other, nigga
I'ma get the shit before we go downstairs
Yeah, aight, what's up with that case, man?
Aw, man, it ain't nothin
Still sittin on seven digits, unlike you, you broke ass nigga
Fuck outta here, this cat right here
This broke ass, ass bettin ass nigga
Bettin five thousand ain't got no money
Chili cheese face ass nigga (fuck outta here)
(Laughter)
These motherfuckers fucking talking
That comeback shit like they cooking crack
All I want my pockets green like slum change
You know what I'm saying?
Front the roll we roll back like rubbers, motherfucker, for real
With no trace of AIDS
Roc-A-Fella clique, nigga
Ayo, we patting down pussy from Sugar Hill to the Shark Bar
Searching for Aspirin when I ascend, we swing
You cling we do our thing and bring
East coast host is hostile colossal
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me, Jay and Primo, got it sewed across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Street knowledge amazing to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals
Get fucked with pistols, just to see my shit, discharge puss
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
And if not then let me do my thing
And if not then let me do my thing
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe
I cream, I diamond gleam
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on end
Can I live, did dough with my nigs, dividends flow
Like the Mississippi Riv', looking jig
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I fondle trigger straight up, shoot my guns
Horizontal, get your weight up, I am
You're barely a hundred and twenty five grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?
Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the U.N
So what the fuck you doing? Whatever, nigga
Fahrvergnügen, rugged yet polished
Spanking dollars with the commas
Banging bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly farther
Fry hotter, you die gotta, fuck with me witness mañana
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on, bring it on, bring it on
Bring it on, if you think, if you think, if you think
Nickels and dimes, kilos and nines
I got the formula to success: get yourself
A kilo from Bobbito, then get yourself a couple of peoples
And we can make this work, never let them niggas try to jerk
If they do, put them in the dirt then murk
Now, get your property some place to harbor these
Take a [?] now it's time to flip 'em like Micky D's
Take your baking soda and your triple beam
Not too much soda, gotta keep it potent enough to cripple fiends
And keep 'em running, coming back; keep your gun in lap
In case these niggas try to steal your crack, there'll be none of that
Just lock it down like Comstock nothing better
-Tor, move fast to have a empty case
When you start seeing dough get that fire proof sentry safe
Hustling 101 welcome to the class
You'll learn the art of dealing history and making broken English your math
Every dollar like its my last, 'cause it might be
I stay away from hoochies that love Gucci's and Louis
Vuitton - the Don, before I spend: do me
With a couple of O's that follow downing bottles of rosé
And now we're celebrating living life 'cause Hell can wait
What about rapping, rappers always be asking, "What?"
While you was on promo tour I was at home laughing
The fireproof sentry safe if we die for loot
Slacking in the game, can't make it happen
Cop some cracks and put yourself back on the map and
You got that shit they want, need, gotta have when they're using
Before they try to Larry Davis me we're going public
Can't see my future from the street so I live for now
Gotta get legit before they hear my name too much downtown
Tryna be up out this shit soon as I start packing
Every time I try to leave this game it pull me back in
Think bags of it 'cause I never had shit
I gotta get mine regardless even if it means
That's all I know so that's all I wrote
On December 3rd, one day before my 44th birthday I will embark on a 22 Days challenge to go completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based!! This all began a few months back when a good friend and vegan challenged me to embrace a “plant-based breakfast” everyday. It was surprisingly easier on me than I thought…
Why now? There’s something spiritual to me about it being my 44th birthday and the serendipity behind the number of days in this challenge; 22 (2+2=4) coupled with the fact that the challenge ends on Christmas day…It just feels right!
So you can call it a spiritual and physical cleanse. I will post my progress… Any professional vegans out there that have any great food spots please help out! Please ha. I don’t know what happens after Christmas. A semi-vegan, a full plant-based diet? Or just a spiritual and physical challenge? We’ll see…
Best of luck and health!
P.S. B is also joining me.
I will let my friend Marco explain the benefits of a plant based diet here.
Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn
We go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard (Agh!)
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn, we go hard, we go hard
This is black hoodie rap
There's no fear in my eyes where they lookin' at
Better look on map
Besides, me nah like to eye fight
Me nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (Christ!)
But if a man test my Stuy
I promise he won't like my reply
Boom-bye-bye, like Buju, I'm crucial
Chain snatchin', ain't have it, gotta get it
Same shiddit, from Brownsville to Bainbriddidge
Fatherless child, Mama pulled double shifts
So the number runners was the only ones I hanged widdith
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fiddith
Fear no orangutans, piddeel ciddaps

Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
I jack, I rob, I sin
Aw, man—I'm Jackie Robinson
'Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets, I'm the Black Branch Rickey
From Brooklyn corners, burnin' branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie; Brooklyn, hippie
I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no history in my borough, they borrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half-orphan, Mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did; still, I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
While I'm doin' my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge, face the consequence
Once bid ten, now I paid my dues
Risk takers, we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warnin'
(Brooklyn!) Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick workin' like we blue collar
Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step, one step, give it up more
The road is rough and the street's a mess
Robbin' out the commercial stash
Kill the voice screamin' in my head
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard

Gimme back the chain, it's over for you dames
Kidnap mine?
Nigga I will click-clack push your wig back further than Tyra Banks' hairline
Your bank versus mine
The Joneses can’t keep up
Maybe my nigga Nas, but I got stronger after Ether
We fly high, no lie, you know this (Brooklyn!)
We stay fly, no lie, you know this (Brooklyn!)

Wanting more paper than Puff
Last week Bleek puffed Puff paper up
And Beans buy a Bentley every week
Plus real estate in Miami is highway robbery
Wars cost, I need guns for my robberies
I'm buying tanks, if you're thinking it's just rap
Don't go too far on that verse
Get your whole chest collapsed
It's just the facts
God bless the cats that think I'm a liar
Pick up a paper nigga, read my priors
"Just retire!"
Not 'til my salary's like the real Mike Lowry
Everything I say I do, you can feel my words now
You don't even know me and you mad
Now I know exactly how it feels to be a Laker
With a keyless ignition, eating Chow's
A Nobu nigga, merci beaucoup
I'm in France, I meant Japan
What the fuck wrong with you?
Everybody wanna know my net worth
Niggas wake up on my dick—eat some breakfast first
I'm a legend, I ain't even left this Earth
I don't care about no vest, when that TEC hit it hurts
Spinning that Lexus in reverse
Making your next whip a hearse
Best to keep it in the verse
But I'm an outcast, nigga
So I gotta keep a piece
So when it cock you and shock you, it's a security breach
Don't make me reach point break
I hit you, Point Blank
This ain't a movie dog!
Out the trunk, trunk trunk
You better stop fucking around
You're gon' make me chase your coward ass down
With the pump, pump, pump
Young!
Black Album's on the way
I know you heard my footsteps
What?
Well fuck you... bitch
Now can you bounce wit me, wit me, wit me wit me
Can you bounce wit me, bounce wit me, wit me wit me

Bitches kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a, eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo
Can I get a fuck you
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough
Can I get a woop woop
Can I get a fuck you

Yeah, uh-uh uh uh
You ain't gotta be rich but fuck that
Before I put this pussy on your mustache
Can you afford me? My niggas breadwinners, never corny
Ambition makes me so horny
Not the fussin' and the frontin'
If you got nothing, baby boy, you better
Get up, get out and get some, shit
I like a - lot of Prada, Alizé and vodka
Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up
I got to snap 'em, let it loose, then I knock ya
Feel the juice, then I got ya - when you produce a rock
Never test my patience, nigga, I'm high maintenance
High class, if you ain't rollin', bypass
If you ain't holdin' I dash yo
Can I get a fuck you
To these bitches from all of my niggas
To these niggas from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggas without dubs
Can I get a fuck you
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough

Gi-gi-gi-geyeah-geyeah
Can ya bounce wit me, bounce wit me
UHH!
Uhh! Yeah
It ain't even a question
How my dough flows, I'm good to these bad hoes
Like my puss wet like damp clothes
What y'all niggas don't know: it's e-asy to pimp a hoe
Bitches better have my money fo' sho'
Before they go runnin' they mouth, promotin' how
I be dickin' they, back out, go 'head, let it out
I fucks with my Gat out, bounce and leave a hundred
Makin' 'em feel, slutted even if they don't want it
It's been so long, since I met a chick ain't about chips but then I'm
Dead wrong, when I tell 'em, "be gone"
So hold on to the feelin' of flossin' and plat-num
'Cause from now on, you can witness Ja the i-con
With hoodies and Timbs on, 'cause I thugs my bitches
VV studs my bitches, then we rob bitch niggas
I'm talkin' 'bout straight figures, if you here, you with us
Can I get a fuck you
To these bitches from all of my niggas
Can I get a woop woop
Who don't got love for niggas without dubs

Couple a hits
Help me out yo
Can you bounce with me

Left side can you bounce with me with me
In the middle can you bounce with me
Help me out
Can I hit in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse, if I was broke would you want me
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a by the name of
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a working harder than nine to five
Then ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a so you can shop and tear the mall up
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a player when his dough is low
Can I get a (whoop whoop)
To all of my thugs who don't love those that get no dough
Can I get a (whoop Whoop)
To all of my ladies, uh, aha

Uh Uh
Now can you bounce with me
Can you bounce with me with me with me
Can you bounce with me
Bounce bounce bounce
Yeah, hah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to somethin' epic, you know?
Well, we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Through that desperation, we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose
So, we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right?
What do you bring to the table?
While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely
My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
"I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure."
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into?
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas
Ge-ge-geyeahhh
Can I live?
Can I live?
My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity
In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
"Let's do this," it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS — you see me stressed, right?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?
You plan to bang, I plan to bang too
You sayin' my name to entertain ya crew
I ain't playin' no games, when shots exchange you're through
Fresh off probation I got a charge to throw away
My lawyer say for eighty large it'll go away
And that ain't no money to Jay
So you could get it broad day on Broadway while TRL's tapin'
You playin the game you know you ain't gon' win
Quit playin them childish games with grown men
I don't give a fuck about cars or chrome rims
I got apartments you could put your home in
Can I live?
Do not put my verse on y'all records dawg!
The boy trap money like bear hunters
Dear Summer, I know y'all gonna miss me
For we been together like Nike Air's and crisp T's
S. Dot's and Polo fleece's
Purple label shit with the logo secret
Gimme a couple of years, shhh, I might just sneak in
A couple of words and like Peaches & Herb
We'll be reunited and it feel so hood
Well I do this in my slumbers, Summer
I ain't none of these half-assed new comers, you know how I do Summer
I drop heat when you bring the sun up
The combo make niggas act up I pick the gun up
Niggas back up they know I ain't no fronter
I don't talk shit I just flip and "Un" ya
I ain't makin' you the butt of my jokes
Let's not stray from what I came to say
To my beloved, I think we need some time away
They say if you love it
If it comes back you should know it's there to stay
From the public, should've gave me the Pulitz'
But instead gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging till the casket dips
But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird, some queer, I still want them to share
In all the success I receive, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em but they don't love me
They like the drunk uncle in ya
{Laughing}
Though they lame it's still the same still you love 'em the same
Like when cats make subliminal records
Know they can't directly direct it at me I don't respect it
And you don't really want it with Hov for the record
I put a couple of careers on hold - you could be next kid
You keep entering the danger zone
You gonna make that boy Hov put your name on a song
If you that hungry for fame cocksucker, c'mon!
Say when, take ten paces and spin
But on another note I'm bout to take another va-cay on another boat
Goddamn a motherfucker rode his way out the hood
And I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could try to play like he Suge
Then I gotta pull it like Dutch Schultz
You pass the Dutchy I'll blast you trust me
I'm in a good groove
And I ain't tryin to mess my thing up
Yo, I'mma stop Flex, I don't want nobody to catch feelings
I had to take off the blazer, loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth, Superman is alive
{Laughing}
Yeah, is y'all niggas finished, yo?
Got your little radio play, your little BDS, huh
You finished nigga? Huh huh, y'all finished
Can I live, huh
Can I live, yo, you're being stingy with the fucking music again yo
Yo, yo... yo I blacks out, I pulls the MAC out
Scream "what's that about?", then I clap out
I get my plot on and my drop on, through the rotten
Feeling it (feeling it), chickens are ice grilling it
Cops pulling it over, Jigga react militant
Speed off, officer told me turn the beat off
I turned it a level higher, then return the devil's fire
I'm raised different, react in situations niggas lay stiff in
Rookies blame it on the age difference
My subliminal flows, create criminal odes
Sing along if y'all with me, til the end of the road
I'm cynical, when in the view of the public
And this is because, I'm defensive when I'm in interviews
The percentage who don't understand, is higher than the percentage who do
Check yourself, what percentage is you?
Can I live, for all my niggas with all white Air Force Ones
Stand bowlegged like a bulldog, know what I mean, huh?
Can I live, to all the cee-lo champs
Two green dice and one red stop the bank and roll, heads, yo
Can I live, to all my niggas who drink Hennessy straight
Cop mixtapes and sell weight, niggas
I got the Feds sending me letters, 'cause I'm schooling the youth
Why is it? Why don't y'all try to visit the neighborhoods, I live in?
Where cops lock you up more than try to defend you
I push you to the limit when I'm needing the wealth
Ran into shorty bopping down the ave
On his way to clocking math then
He proceeded to show me a block of slab and said
Ayo there's money out there I just got to have
When I catch up to these fiends I'ma knock 'em on they ass
Not to brag, sometimes I look at my life and laugh
How I think about school and it taught me not to grab
When I backed out, let one out, let the barrel turn
That credit you dead it
About a dope fiend before reading Donald Goines
Flipping boy and, using the right cut
This slab gotta re-up and re-bag
Once I get it I got it I lock it, nobody pop shit
Selling twenties on my block, bitch, on some blacktop shit
What you want, what you want nigga?
Can I live...
To all my niggas that hold coke in they bubble coat
Can I live...
Yo USA, all my chicks that strip
Boos go to the store with the doobie pins still in
All my chicks with the credit card scams
Two kids, one job, and no man
All my chicks getting that washing set with their welfare check
Haha, all the mamis dame un beso, alright
All my niggas rocking them fitted caps
Trying to get at this rap, know what I mean
All my cats with open cases, big cars, and no license
I like that shit, I see y'all
All my niggas that say pause after they say some fucked up shit Hahahahaha, rock on and uh, Jigga shit, Roc-A-Fella forever yo
Uhh, Major Coins, yeah, uh-huh
Memph Bleek nigga, uh-huh uh
Ah shit, okay, okay, alright
Big man! You wanna make some big bucks, huh?
Let's see how tough you are
You know something about cocaine? Digame!
You kidding me or what man?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday - new guys
They said they got two keys for us, for openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there
And if it is what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back
You can do that you make five grand
Meet them at the Bodegas, noon Friday
You get the buy money then
Oh and chico, if anything happens to the buy money
Eh, pobrecito
JAY-Z's gonna stick your heads up your asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked
Bounce.. bounce, bounce, Jay-Z huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha
Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella y'all
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning
With the sound of my money machining (brrrr)
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and running
Y'all niggas don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up
I'm taking out this time (yeah, yeah, what)
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star
Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Why play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
The way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real
Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it? Good, me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even!
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
To knock the hustle for real
Yo wassup everybody, this is Maria Davis, Mad Wednesdays, we here tonight to have a good time
("Yo! Start the show! Start the show!")
Wait a minute; I see my man over there, Jay-Z
Jay-Z, Dame Dash let me hear that lil tape of yours, and it's phat
Why don't you come up here and kick a lil freestyle
Put that champagne down, and kick a lil freestyle for me tonight
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Y'all motherfuckers must've heard that Tribe Called Quest shit
Let's do it again!
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone... check this out
Too much West Coast dick lickin'
And too many niggas on a mission, doin' your best Jay-Z rendition
Too many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions
That you're just fish in a pool of sharks, nigga, listen
Too many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a ho
I'ma call you a ho, too many bitches are shady
Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is
Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances
No question; Jay-Z got too many answers
I been around this block too many times
To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together
'Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever
So I change styles every two rhymes
That's 22 two's for y'all motherfuckers out there, nahmean?
Shall I continue? Check it out, what?
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone... yo, yo, yo
Copped to reach my quota, push rock, roll up smooth like on ya
Whole groove like hold-up, swoll up
Too many faggot niggas clockin' my spendin'
Exercisin' your gay-like minds like Richard Simmons
If you could catch Jay right, on the late night
I dip, spit quicker than you ever seen
Administer pain, next the minister's screamin' your name
At your wake as I peek in, look in your casket
Mine's thinkin' longevity until I'm seventy
Livin' heavenly, fuck, felony after felony, what?
Nigga you broke, what the fuck you going to tell me?
Jay-Z, Jay-Z, now you know this is a phat track (aight)
Now this is comin' on your new album, on Roc-A-Fella records in '96?
But I know you innocent, and I'm behind you 100%. Mad Wednesdays, Ruby King, DJ Ace, Dame Dash, Roc-A-Fella Records, we all behind you, you can come back any time!
(Hah, thanks a lot)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Ace, turn that music down. I smell some reefer, now you see? That's why, our people don't have anything, because we don't know how to go in places and act properly
("Hey, shut the fuck up!")
Wait a minute, wait a minute, who told me shut the eff up? Who told me to shut the eff up? Get him out of here! I'm not gonna continue this show, until you throw him out! Get him out right now, then I'ma continue my speech!
Thank you, he's out of here now, now like I was sayin'... we gotta build our own businesses, we gotta get our own record companies goin' like Roc-A-Fella Records, we got this, put our own money in our businesses...
Can't Knock The Hustle
Ok
Hey
This song right there
Was off the first album I ever made
Also was fortunate enough to be blessed by the presence of
The Queen of, just the Queen man
I wanna say R&B, I wanna say hip hop
Mary!
Let me get all the way up beside you girl
You ready?
I just had to test y'all
I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter
Y'all can't fade me, chrome stocks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Player's is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any player intervening with the sound of my money machining
My cup runneth over with hundreds
Six digits and running, y'all dudes don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
(Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching four lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
While I play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
Until legs spread like germs
What y'all don't know
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Cause you can't knock the hustle
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
(Talk to em Mary)
Cause that's the way you're making me feel
(They feel you, they feel you)
I'm just trying to live right
I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real
Yo, lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I got to hot your crew
I got to, let you dudes know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though (me)
Slick like a gato, ya boy Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
You ain't having it
Oh good me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us huh
At my arraignment screaming
Alright
(Let me buy you one)
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
(That's right, Jay Z baby)
Baby one day you'll be a star
(Let's go all the way uptown)
Cause that's the way you're making me feel
I'm just trying to get mine I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real
(Let's go all the way up town, let's take em to Yonkers)
Family Affair [Mary J. Blige (Jay Z)]
People can we get it crunk tonight

(Come on let's go)
Come on everybody
Gotta thank Jigga for letting me get down tonight
(No no thank you)
Thank you very much
Thank you
(One more time for Ms Mary J Blige y'all
('Cause you can't knock the hustle...)
Foooooool's, paradise
You better think twice
(Roc-A-Fella y'all, it don't stop)
'Cause it's not very nice
We about to change this game dear
Check my pockets, ain't nothing but game there
I remain without peer, keep the lames clear
And the cats that's all about scratch remain here
On top of this Metropolis
Dropped off every tier
Heard it the other day
Through the missive, peep how they script it
We got to hear you every night 'fore we hit the lights, it's type addictive
Need cash to live with, the beat goes on
Every day is a hustle, the heat grows on
Funny thing happens when years of chasing money unfolds
Niggas stay low, like six-fours of shit and gold
And watch for hoes with form fitting clothes
Can't knock the hustle
I'm taking out this time (uh huh, uh huh)
('Cause you can't knock the hustle, how we do)
Who do you think you are?
Maybe one day you'll be a star
In a man's world need a girl to touch something
Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something
When I get home, then it's on
Girl just crack your shaped legs like Grade A eggs
Moans, turns to hollers and screams as we zone like a college team
Then they can hear you from Hollis, Queens
Life with me, consists of a lot of things
Chicks in your ear, kicking dirt, 'cause you got hotter rings
But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness
Remind them freak chicks, stay out my bizziness
Know they can't love it, trips to L.A. with no luggage
In first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me
Steak still warm on me
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy (uh huh)
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel (how we, how we do)
The way you're making me feel ('cause you can't knock the hustle)
I don't want no romance, I just want the chance
Ever since I retired, working alongside of live wires
I guess I'm biased 'cause what I talk about I live
These rap dudes conflicted
What part of the game is this?
Seems brainless, on tours like whores, guess what I'm saying I miss
Cats that go all out for their gold plaques
Started with four jacks, ended up with gold Ac's
Bet your lungs collapse if my funds get trapped
On their, way to me through you, screw you
Gun blew you, out of one then two shoes
Run through you like um, excuse you
But that's my cash, gotta understand your hustle
But that's my cash, you don't understand
Let my dough pass, you can show it love
But don't knock the hustle
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Maybe one day you'll be a star (Jigga, Meli'sa)
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy (uh huh, ha ha)
'Cause that's the way you making me feel
The way you making me feel
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
I don't want no romance (how we do), I just want the chance (say what)
Can't knock the hustle for real
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Remix (the hustle), '96
(Can't knock the hustle)
Don't stop, 'til the top
Roc-A-Fella y'all
Irv Gotti, Jigga (can't knock the hustle)
Meli'sa Morgan, uh huh
'Cause you can't knock the hustle
(The hustle, can't knock the hustle
'Cause I can't knock the hustle, the hustle
'Cause I can't knock the hustle)
'Cause you can't knock the hustle...
Check my pockets ain't nothing but game there
Keep the lames clear, and the cats that's all about scrap remain here
On top of this Metropolis
My name is like a square
Dropped off every tier
Now y'all can swear to Jay
Heard it the other day
Through the mystery, we get it swiftly
We got to hit you every night before we hit the lights it's type addictive
Need cash to live with, the beat goes on
Everyday is a hustle, the heat grows on
Funny thing happen, in the midst of chasing money and foes
And the worst thing worst than getting old is not getting old
Niggas stay low, like six-fours of shit and gold
And watch the hoes with form fitting clothes
And I hope they shine
Seen a lot of things and enough memories to last me two lifetimes
Can't knock the hustle
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
Baby one day you'll be a star
Check this
In a mans world need a girl to tough something
Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something
If you skating through the night to the light, then trust something
When I get home
Then it's on
Girl just crack those shaped legs like Grade A eggs
Love the way you behave and beg
Then they can hear you from Hollis, Queens (226)
Life with me, consists of a lot of things
Chicks in your ear hit the dirt cause you got hotter things
But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness
Remind them freak chicks to stay out my business
You know they can't love it, trips to LA with no luggage
In first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me
Bank still off on me
But until the last day, I'm the one who's crazy
Cause that's the way you making me feel (can't knock the hustle)
Can't knock the hustle for real
Ever since you retired, working alongside of live wires
I guess I'm biased, what I talk about I live
Seems brainless, on tours like whores guess what I'm saying I meant
Cats that go all out for their gold plaques
Bet your lungs collapse if my funds get trapped
Gun blew you, out of one then two shoes
Run through you like UH, EXCUSE YOU!
That's my cash, you don't understand
Let my dough pass, you can show it love
Like a rap star in front of the club
But don't knock the hustle
I'm taking out this time (uh huh, uh huh)
To give you a piece of my mind
This what we do 'bout this time of year
Who do you think you are? (uh huh, uh huh)
Baby one day you'll be a star
(Oh, shit)
Started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart.. and a real live nigga nature
Yes you know I'll die for you
And ya know I'll ride with you
I will always try with you
I will climb a mountain high aha
So baby come and get more close to me
This is where your love is supposed to be
I let you kiss me where it hurts
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
Little Ecstasy, Hennessy, mix with me
Pointin' to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin' walls 'til them bastard drop
Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite
Livin' life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature, feel me!
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
(Young's in the building)
To knock the hustle for real
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you playas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
Slick like a gato, Jay-Z
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a playa see me
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it, good me either
At my arraignment screaming
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a playa eating, yeah
Hah, hah, hah, hah, yeah, yeah
What it is player?
(You player, it's all about you
How you gon' say that man)
If I had your hand I'd turn mine in
(Far as I'm concerned, if I had your hand, I cut mines off)
You know hoe money is slow money but it's sho' money
(Check this out man, you run up on your bitches
This is what you tell 'em
Stick they hands in they panties, grab that knot
Stick they arm in a car window, drop it like it's hot)
Like a hymen, when I'm rhyming with remarkable timing
Spitting venom up in the minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar
Might you remember, my shit is cold like December
Smoother than Persian rugs, the cashmere
Chromosomes make a nigga Jigga - Jay-Z, lethal drugs
18-carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like I'm rapping them through platinum teeth
'Cause all beef return well done filet mignon
Yawn, (slow) when you hoes try to con a pro
As if you didn't know, Jay's about getting dough
Spitting flow like fine wines down your earlobe
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
Honeys hum in melody when I rub it like crystal
The proper etiquette, when I drop the subject verb
Then the predicate, with this rich nigga rhetoric
I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole
I stick pearl tongues your world'll never know
From New York to Paris, the vocal style vary
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D, Now
Notice the child swift like a Lotus
Focus on the loc' I be the greatest nigga that wrote it
Return of the Jedi, from Rio De Janeiro on the red eye
Yet I still feel the need to be fly
I did die when I'm rapping then slide like satin
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice
From my nigga Sauce, I hit you with this advice
Life's short, so play hard and stick hard
And the only time you love them is when your dick hard
Whoooh! (That's cashmere baby)
(Man, shit, J to the A to the Y to the Z)
Cashmere baby
(Motherfucking pimp that's what he be)
Cashmere baby
Sho' yo right, sho' yo right
(Them niggas know)
Check it out, check it out
Ghetto's Errol Flynn, hot like heroin
Young pimps is sterile when I pimp through your borough and
I gotta keep your tricks intact
'Cause I walk like a p-iy-imp, talk like a mack, man
The sweet Ms. Fine Thing puh-layah, sho' yo right
I'm game tight, so why should it change tonight?
Go tell your peeps dog I'm lethal until it ain't right
I pimp hard on a trick: look
Fuck if your leg broke bitch, hop up on your good foot...
Ready for it
I'm ready for it
Yeah, ahh
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Nigga with that Lisa, uh
Talkin' about that Lisa, nigga, with that Westside, nigga
With that Eastside, that dance, uh
Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies
May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly
Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths
I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
Y'all body language is all remedial
My crash course was much tougher
Then hug their friends' mothers
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem (Uh-huh, yeah)
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare (Yeah)
I sat down with Prince, eye to eye
He told me his wishes before he died
Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy had "Slave" on his face
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't "big bro" me, don't "Big Homie"
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams
I've been out of touch for a couple years
I've been ready for this for real
'Cause I've been ready for you, for real
Look, you've done enough
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?
Nigga with that Lisa, uh
Talkin' about that Lisa, nigga, with that Westside, nigga
With that Eastside, uh
What you think you like me? You ain't like me motherfucker
You a punk, I been with made people, connected people
Who you been with? Chain snatchin', jive-ass, maricon motherfuckers
Why don't you go get lost
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or somethin'
You're now tuned into the greatest
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
Can't touch it, fuck it, can't see 'em, try to be 'em
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th Wonder
Phase one of the takeover, the break's over
Nigga, I'm the God MC, me, Jay-Hovah
Bangin' to the hearse where my doctors hand
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I did crime, got away
They wanna see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even a half a gram, better flame those, plainclothes
Rep ya game pros
We celebrate this, while you sittin' back screamin' you hate this
Try to rape this, get caught in my crime matrix
Spittin' sperm inside of latex
You get, no respect like a child rapist
Leave your melon spacious, career felon, no hiatus
Nor Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block with diseases
Informants, heatin' the spot up like global warmin'
Who start *shit*? My style is laced with arsenic
You call the order, I'll be in Hell
Righteous, dominate the global, my life's a novel
Blazin in Barnes and Noble, idolize the vocals
I'm Resident Evil, movin' like (?)
Millionaire that flow like water, rap *niggas* runnin'
I, oughta applaud ya, clap at ya
Point the MAC at ya, *niggas* caught up
Like a compound fracture, can't *fuck* widdit
For the love of sex money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets, TECs, honies and thugs
Let the four power, rain on niggas like a spring shower
And bring flowers for the bodies that surround us
If you was lookin' you found us
Movin' with speed, tried to play Superman
Ended up like Chris Reeves
Paraplegic, precise minds like the Pharaohs of Egypt
Shot through a barrel niggas narrowly weaved it
Keepin' my Team top seeded with the Sweet 16's
Bulgin' out of my jeans, on the ten-speed weeded
Holdin', share these shots with you like a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it...
Street anthem anchor, quick to trade shots just like a banker
Lick a round, niggas hit the ground like Sanka
I got ya screwface in forty-two ways
Aim better than toothpaste, Jerry Maguire
"Show Me The Money" like Clue tapes
Run up in your spot with a few eights, zonin'
Four shots spin ya like chrome rims
White sheets got ya wrapped like a Roman
Back in New York, honey wants it, just spit blood and talk funny
Like dark rooms, hits fat, cub with a harpoon
Heat-seekin', grill huntin', still frontin'?
Keep squeezin', *fuck it*, I leave the whole street wheezin'
Got 'em scared to drop like soap in jail
Just think of ours as can't be touched, tested, whatever
Never disrespect this thing of ours
Roc-A-Fella family

Hah, haha, uh, let's get it in

Tell the whole world the truth is back
You ain't gotta argue about who can rap
'Cause the proof is back, just go through my raps
(New York, New York!) Yeah, where my troopers at?
I don't care what you do for stacks
I know the world glued your back to the wall
You gotta brawl, do that
I been through that, been shot at, shoot back
Gotta keep a peace like a Buddhist
I ain't a New Jack; nobody gon' Wesley Snipe me
It's less than likely, move back
Let I breathe, Jedi Knight
The more space I get the better I write
Oh, never I write, but if, ever I write
(Change clothes, and go)
You know I stay fresh to death, a boy from the projects

Best believe, I sweat out weaves
Give Afro Puffs like R.A.G.E
Aww you get if could move it
Then run and tell them ducks you heard Hovi new shit
He is to the East coast what Snoop is
To the West Coast, what 'Face is to Houston
Young Hov' in the house is so necessary

Get your wig pushed back by the wig push-back-er (Ugh, ugh)
Memph' Bleek in the house! Still here, never left (Ugh, ugh)
Still bust, more or less, still puff, BITCH! (Ugh, ugh)
Young Hova in the house—Jigga! (Yeah)
Cris' sipper, six-dipper, wrist-glitter, nigga!
Hold up, love
Don't forget about them blades, shit, chopping it up
It's the motherfucking Roc, bitch, who hotter than us?
Jay-Hov, 'bout to change my name to Jay Peso
But in the meantime, call me William H. though
Throwing it up like liquor on an empty stomach
{*cycle whizzes by*} Y'all don't hear nothing?
Who that, Mac? Naw, dawg, that's M. Bleek coming
Who the FUCK! want! what?!
Catch Bleek in South Beach out of the reach of the police
Gat on my lap (Yeah), bitch on my back (Holla)
'Gnac in my pocket, smoking that sticky chocolate (Ooohwee!)
Holler if you want drama with...
The Dynasty; Amil, Bleek, Jigga and...
Me without a gun dawg, unlikely
You know I keep the heat right under the wife-beat'
Three-X tee, I'm Lincoln now, you can't see the pound
Got a little gut, so the gat sit tucked (Fuck...)
I run wild, gun high, L.A. style
Whether block shit or rock shit
Get Sig' any track, I'ma spit the talk to it
Down South gon' bounce; Crips gon' walk to it
Every dawg, every Blood in the hood, bark to it
Get the ounce, get the 'Woods, everybody spark to it
We can smoke in here, put the choke in the air, yeah

Young Hova in the house—Jigga!
Cris' sipper, six-dipper, wrist glitter, nigga!
I wear more bling to The Source and Soul Trains
More chains than rings, niggas won't do a thing
I bangs the four-four in plain daylight; I'm deranged
One-shot Dillinger, one shot killin' ya
It's only one Roc La Familia
Matter-fact, the East Coast—fuck took it from me?
Fourth album, still Jay, still spitting that real shit
Volume 3, still sold more records than Will Smith
Can't call this a comeback, I run rap, the fuck is y'all saying?
Five million? I done that, and I've come back
Ex-sinner, Grammy Award winner
Balling repeatedly, highlights on SportsCenter
Please repeat after me—it's only one rule
I will not lose!

Uhh, yeah, uh-uhh-uh
Uh-huh, uh-uh-uhh, uhh, uhh
I ain't tryin to be rude dude
But give a nigga some space
I ain't tryin to be rude dude
Just, give a nigga some space
Just tryin to talk honey dog
Why is you over here lookin' at me
While all these girls up in here?
Y'all don't want me to spray the semi in here
I mean if you a fan I consider you fam'
But shake a nigga hand, well shit god damn
All that ("Do you remember me dawg?") Nah I'm drawin' a blank
You got me feelin like a fish, in a fish tank
Just think, if you came to a club
Tryin to find a little hon for some one-night love
'Stead you got another nigga all up in your mug
You make me uncomfortable thug, go thatta-way!
'Cause I keep enough heat to melt that away
I came in some sweats, I came to get met
Tryin' to find a chick that make it hard for me to "next!"
Treat me like a baby, mouth on her breast-es
.. go find you one
Go get your dance on, go grind on one, damn
.. go find you one
So many hoes in here
It's so many hoes in here
I ain't tryin' to be rude dude, whyon'tcha disappear?
There's so many hoes in here
Yeah yeah yeah I know you rap and your sister spit too
You been callin' the office and you can't get through
I understand all that, but now ain't the time
I came to the club to get that off my mind
And all you thugs with your war stories startin' to bore me
I ain't tryin' to hear about your guts and glory
I'm tryin' to hear B.I.G. and some cuts from N.O.R.E
And you keep talkin' over the beat like Clue ("Do you remember?")
You're a janitor, go find somethin' to screw
Disappear like Copperfield, go cop a feel
Play hide and seek witchaself for real, huh
The chick came dressed up just to get messed up
She got her hair done, just to get it sweated up
Shit I'm tryin' to help her out
Whyon'tcha help me out and be out?
Quick question - yo, why you over here?
So many hoes in here
My office hours 9 to 5, whyon'tcha call me there
It's so many hoes in here
I ain't tryin' to be rude dude, whyon'tcha disappear?
There's so many hoes in here
I understand you got issues but I really don't care
There's so many hoes in here
Jeah, jeah, jeah
You're invadin' my space
You need to, be easy, ahh
You're invadin' my space
You're invadin' my space
C'mon dawg, be easy, ahh
Uh-uh, I don't know why they do that
Heh, I don't understand
Stop spittin' in my face and go talk to them hoes in here
Stop spittin' in my face and go talk to them hoes in here
C'mon dawg, stop spittin' in my face and go talk to them hoes in here
Be easy
I remove your roof nigga let the sun shine in
Thirty-eight waist, enough to put one nine in
Really a thirty-six without the gun I'm thin
But when the gat is tucked, I'm fat as fuck
Ignorant bastard, I'm takin' it back to day one
No kids, but trust me I know how to raise a gun
For niggas that think I spend my days in the sun
Well here's the shock of your life, the Glock not the mic
Homie I'm not into hype; trust me, I'm still street
You still fuckin' up then trust me I still creep
Yeah I know the platinum chain be lookin' real sweet
S dot Carter turn rappers into martyrs
Separate fathers from their daughters, why bother
I disobeyed the law, threw out the book like you
How dare you look at Jigga like I'm shook like who
I keep the fifth with me nigga, come and get me..
{*gong sounds*} Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-come..
{*bell rings*} COME AND GET ME! Ka-ka-ka..
{*bell rings*} .. Ka-ka-ka-ka-come
{*bell rings*} .. come and get me COME AND GET ME
Don't know what y'all niggas is
Tryin' to do but I don't like it
Yeah, straight gangster shit
Heyyyy, uh-huh-uh-uhh gangster shit
Uhh, straight gangster nigga
Roc..
Yo, the summer's 'bout to get hot
Niggas home from jail and they plottin'
The Continental T, got 'em resentin' me
God I work hard, please don't envy me
I paid the cost to be the boss to floss this hard
All y'all remember is the part about me parkin' the hard
What about all them days I was walkin' my dogs
Barkin' at broads, but they never hollered back
And if they did all they said was, "Where them dollars at?"
Imagine, bein' skinny growin' up around brolic cats
Until I got a gat and loudly start poppin' back
Round the way, niggas called me Bobby Boucher
Now all I hear is whispers of what you gon' do to Jay
Pull out your gat, car jack me, take my cruise away
I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga
I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga
I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga
I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME...
I made it so, you could say Marcy and it was all good
I ain't crossover I brought the suburbs to the hood
Went on MTV with do-rags, I made them love you
You know normally them people wouldn't be fuckin' witchu
'Til I made 'em understand why you do what you do
But instead, all I hear is buzzin' in your crew
How y'all schemin', tryin' to get accustomed to my moves
So y'all could tape my mouth, stake out my house
But I got pride I'm a nigga first
I gotta cock back and pull the trigger first
That's how Jigga work
The funny thing; I represent y'all every time I spit a verse
And that's the shit that hurts
But hey, I got my mind right, got my nine right here
So when y'all feel that the time is right..
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga
I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga
I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga
I got, shots to give, COME AND GET ME...
COME AND GET ME...
Ayo yo, ayo yo
It's only fair that I warn ya, rap's my new hustle
I'm treatin' it like the corner, fuck with me if you wanna
My game change but my mind-frame remains the same
Shit I started from nothin'; zero, zip
I made my way hustlin', I don't owe niggas shit
I'm paranoid now, so I keep the gun gripped
Cats I played skelly with? Niggas done flipped
Two in the stash, one come up when I shift
I keep one under the chair where I sit
I even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch
Ask Biggs; every time he'd come to my crib
He'd find another gun that I hid
I'm ready to make this one of the, hottest summer there is
Everyday like a hundred-and-six... shit...
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga
I won't, part with this, come and get me nigga
I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga
COME AND GET ME...
I got, shots to give, come and get me nigga
Y'all wanna rob the kid? Come and get me nigga
I worked, hard for this, come and get me nigga
COME AND GET ME...
Motherfuckers!
Yeah...
Come experience... life as we know it
As some of you should know it
Actions: well, y'all know the actions
Uhh, I got this shorty on my block always clocking my rocks
To honies hawking, I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I watched him make a few ends, to cop his little sneakers and gear
Then it's just enough for re-up again
To Guess to Versace, now it's diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle
Nobody want to be like Michael where I'm from
Just them niggas who bounced from a gun
We out here trying to make hard white into cohhhhld green
I can help shorty blow out like Afro-Sheen
Plus I can relive my days of youth which is gone
That little nigga's peeps, it's time to put him on
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
It's time to come up (stick up my chest, and make some loot)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)
I'm out here slinging, bringing the drama, trying to come up
I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace
Life could be better like my man reclined in plush leather seats
He's selling weight, I'm selling eight.. balls
Sixteen, trying to graduate to pushing quarters y'all
I ain't going to sweat him I'm a let him come to me
If he give me the nod then these niggas going to see
I'm tired of being out here round the clock, and breaking day
I'm staying fresh, so chickens check
I'm trying to step up to the next level
Pushing Vettes through the 'jects
Diamonds reflect from the sun
Directly in your equilibrium
And son, I'm waiting for my day to come
I got the urge to splurge
I don't want a lifetime sentence, just give me the word
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)
Hey fella I been watching you clocking
Who me? Holding down this block? It ain't nothing
You the man nigga, now stop fronting
Let's drive around awhile! Cool, nigga
Have it all, now listen to me
You let them other niggas get the name, skip the fame
Ten thou' or a hundred G keep your shit the same
You let your shit bubble quietly (AND THEN YOU BLOW!)
Kid, keep your cool
The only way to peep a fool is let him show his hand
Don't blow your dough on hotties
The only thing I got in this world is my word and my nuts
And won't break them for nobody
Hah, I like your résumé, pick a day, you can start
From now until death do us part, nigga (Right!)
It's time to come up (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand my ground)
Gots to lock it down and when they rush (stand on my own two)
Time to come up, hold my own weight, defend my crown
Gots to lock it down and when they rush -- part two
Cocaine whiter now
Operation is sweet
Plus a nigga price is down
We them niggas to see
Time to start the arising now
I don't know what's wrong with Bleek
It seems, I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car
'Cause the last time they seen me hopping out the Coupe
I hopped out in a suit
Look at this nigga Jay fronting, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, just had some shit on my mind
Plus I'm puffing like an ounce more than I used to puff
Taking advice from these niggas but they ain't used to stuff
They had me thinking, "Shit, I'm the one that moved the stuff
While he drive around town in brand new Coupes and stuff"
Swear to God, they had me practically hating his guts
As he approached I spoke, "Jigga, whattup?"
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh)
Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he ain't slow, he musta picked up on the vibe
But had I not been so high, I woulda been able to hide
Tried to cover up myself, as I gave him a five
Hugged him as if I loved him, to the naked eye
It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down
Stay focused, I'm trying to concentrate
But it's like he's reading my mind
As if he can see through this fog and all this weed in my mind
Could he see I had plans on, being the man
Ever since we first spoke and he put that G in my hand
And I gave it back to show him, I was down for the cause
As he approached ("Whattup Bleek?") and I paused
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line (uhh)
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
Soaked the game up (uhh), now it's yo' time to shine (yeah)
Time to change up, no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters
Mouthed off at the cops, outta cranberry drops
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers
With different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us
So 'til death do us, I'm never breaking my bond
Nigga, we Lex movers, V-12 pushers
As I stand
One leg of my pants up, in a stance like, "And what?"
I know these niggas are feeding my mind cancer
But in time's the answer (woo!)
Seems mind-blowing, this weed and Hennessy
Got my mind going, trust me nigga, I'm knowing
Chicks used to ignore me
And my aunt saying I need 50, not 60/40
Your gun is my gun, your clip is my clip, baby
Your fun is my fun (uh huh), your bitch is my bitch
I ain't only touching you, I'm killing your crew
Records sold, nigga, perfect your role, geah
I done came up (uhh), put my life on the line
Soaked the game up (yeah), now it's my time to shine
Time to change up (what?), no more second in line
Nine-eight, these streets is mine (geah, geah)
Soaked the game up (game up), now it's yo' time to shine
Nine-eight, these streets is mine
Soaked the game up, now it's yo' time to shine
Time to change up, no more second in line
Yeah, yeah
Coming of Age two, brand new
* the version on Belly has an extra verse
Yeah, check it
Yo yeah I smoke weed now I don't give a fuck
And I also tote guns in case my dram pop up
It's crew love I spit two at every few thugs
Fo doves blow dubs holdin eight snub
I hold it down my strip, goin nowhere
Flip two eightballs trick the dough on low gear
Nigga don't prolong
Play the studio and get my flow on
And sell weight on a later base
My older brother kept guns on his waist in case he air the place
And walk straight up on you fuckin crooked niggas
I drink Henny mixed wit nothing
My weed and the dutch is somethin
It's Bleek, controlling these streets holdin the heat
Ha ha, this is Roc-A-Fella for life
This is Roc-A-Fella for life
You know it's crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die
As long as you and I keep it movin like a drive-by
We could stack dough sky-high
Niggas can't touch what they can't feel, real recognize real
Crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die
As long as you and I keep it movin like a drive-by
Niggas can't touch what they can't feel, real recognize real
Yo, I set up shop wit nick rocks that'll upset rookies
Make 'em slide like li'l dicks in wet pussy
Open up the whole strip, like Monopoly
Dare one of ya'll to land on my property
Ya'll niggas can't pass go cuz it cost to pass
Type ta land on jail can't pay your bail
I'm the wrong one to lie to
Shit I'm the man who supply who supply who supply YOU
And ya'll a bunch talk money
I'm tryin to get it down for that motherfuckin boardwalk money
Two-brick money new blue six money
Flow like the flu and spit sick money
Peep hotty's Roc-A-Fella wools route
All black mask down wit they tools out
Beanie mack I'll move out
I had niggas runnin from school pickin new routes
Then I'll run and lick a shot make 'em move south
Switch up they last name get a new spouse
Scrambled up some down-payment for a new house
No matter where you go Mack gone find ya
I'm like a shadow nigga I'm right behind ya
I'll blow out ya brains and won't give ya no reminder
Me and my road dog
Spit raw rolled up niggas can smoke on
Shit I let 'em have it you faggots ain't know my status
Fuckin with my mathematics you make us savage
Five nine one six O, light brown
M-E-M-P-H-I-S Bleek put it down
Its crew love, Roc-A-Fella till we die
As long as you and I keep it movin, nigga
Aiyyo I pray to the God MC to bless me
Wit a ill ass flow and sick ass dough
Where it don't make no sense that hundreds and cents and
Thousands of dollars ice freezes my collar
Get the signin bonus know mack toppin them thangs
Nigga it's crew love
Brooklyn, and we don't quit
It’s like this yo, and we don’t stop
I get deep and dark like ditches
But when I rap, I come off
Like death without the glitches
Never crossed the black cat
With the riches, I’m leaving
Stevie, saying "no Wonder you’re superstitious"
Beef, I’m with it, simple
Ya’ll can all get it..
Ya’ll don’t all get it
Don’t nobody of mind for this matter
Can gather the data
Until your mind don’t matter
I bubble like lather
Hustle like the lead-off batter
Til it ain’t funny, you feel me?
Don’t jerk me boy, I rip it silly
I’ll let you rise, of course
But if you don’t fall off on your own
MC's, I cut off at the knees like shorts
With no known remedy
On "bended knee" til "the end of the road"
I lie low, forget this record shit, with one sale
Yo, pardon me..
Check it out:
The nerve of these herbs
Ya’ll know who swerve
From the curb in the LEX
I’m splashing, splurging
Dashing, that’s my word, you know?
Champagne glass is crashing, can’t ration
Had a buck fifty while
You were still taking Skippy to school
Ran with one of them cats
That hides Tiffany’s for them jewels
Back when Duke was jumping
Out of cabs in Krush Groove
Four cars and four hundred thousand shots later
You know what I mean?
Trying not to curse, you know?
Trying not to curse up in this piece..
They can't keep a good man down
Keep the vibes and they stood my grounds
They will never ever take my crown
Who Jah bless I say no man curse
Things gettin' better when they thought it would be worse
Here comes the officers askin' for a search
You in the presence of a king
Scratch that, you in the presence of a God
Put in the belly of the beast
I escaped, a nigga never had a job
Scott Boras, you over baby
Robinson Cano, you coming with me
These niggas like rotary phones
Niggas always try to knock a nigga down
Knock me to my knees about a million times
I sold a million records like a million times
These niggas shouldn't let me in
I ball so hard on ESPN
See my name come across on CNN
'bout 6 minutes, you gonna see it again
Shit on me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of your history
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of they history
If Fear is your only God
Crown, crown
Crown, crown
Bulletproof glass, glass roof like the Pope
Bulletproof love, niggas down since the yolk
Bitch asked if I was God, fuck I'm supposed to say? No?
You already seen me turn a man to a G.O.A.T
You already know what I could do with the coke
Dropped it in the water, made it disappear
I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope
I make my roof get ghost, bottom grill, I make my tooth get gold
All the shit I did, I wasn't supposed to live, Hallelujah Hov
Wasn't for the 'caine wouldn't be able
Wasn't for the bread, probably be dead
Best friends become ya enemies, niggas' knives are double-edged
I was left for dead, they tried to wipe me out of your history
I told y'all niggas if it wasn't a skirt it was gonna be a dress
Big poison and fuck up the city rots
The whole world supposing he's tryna dispose of me
You must know I give a fuck though, got a mean rebuttal
Try me! See where your luck go, you know what though?
I'm what you don't get a second chance at
Think you can chance that?
I'm laying niggas down ba'y bro
Think you can stand that?
Your train of thought derails like amtrak
Me, my crimees, and a couple of dime pieces
A bunch of rolexes, unlimited credit line visas
Heat is for niggas that want to touch but can't reach us
Leave him speechless when the lead reaches his dome
Life ain't nothing but beaches and homes
It don't stop, I can't stop
Spend too much of their time gossiping and shit
You know?
That's something else though
We'll address that at a later date though
Everything must be addressed though
You know?
Nothing slides
Word up
It's murder
Dead or alive
My skills are, and will remain, ahead of you guys
Don't know when to let go and let young souls die
See a nigga diss me, ain’t nothing new, understand?
But it's how I retaliate which defines who I am
Jay-Z, ain't nothing dead or alive playing me
I take beef to the grave, that's how my momma raised me
So Heaven or Hell, niggas better have some answers for me
God damn y'all been on my dick a long time
(It's murder)
Welcome to the Terror Dome
You error prone niggas sick
Roc-A-Fella clique thick as herring bones
What legends are made of
Like whenever accurates hit
My voice locked behind bars to a bid for this spectacular shit
Fake kids fold and lie, holding why?
Saw a half a million sales with a golden eye
Patrol the sky to see bucks
More we stuck in, bust shots till we chuckin'
You saw the faggot let em know more could have it
Automatic rhyme spot 4 shot towards his attic
Dead or alive
If it's jewels you like
You fools gonna fuck around and lose your life
And I just bruise your wife
Don't get it confused right cause we in the spotlight
Still I hold the Glock with the wrist twist like these
Gangsta shit no thanks to shit
Niggas selling a million records more banks to split
Jay-Z motherfucker, who you think this is?
I heard his body was too hot to get near it
Too late to hear it
Two slugs wait to release his spirit
The known truth: had a bad habit for blowing loot
Two niggas on the roof busting down at the phone booth
Running for cover at point blank cause bullets is hovering
Drug them in after the slug went in
I take a phrase in God we trust it's a must
Live by the gun die by the same shit you bust
Fly bitches with waves from DC to Cali
Rally and tally up my dough for the grand finale
Grapevines throughout the alley unknown figures said
Trigger lead knew how bad we needed the nigga dead
Conjure all ways escape closer
Never spar drove the car to the edge of the tar
With intentions to scar, shooting motherfuckerss to Allah
Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)
Rock.. on, Roc-A-Fella y'all
While others spit that Wonderama shit
Me and my conglomerate
Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest shit
Live out my dreams until my heart give out
Involved with cream, you know exactly what this shit's about
Fuck y'all mean? Handlin' since a teen, I dish out
Like the point guard off your favorite team, without doubt
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine 'til the dough hit it
And told me that the Mo' did it
And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but, no bitches
Watch how I'm walkin'
'Cause even the thoroughest niggas be NARC'in
Tryin' to strike a bargain, hopin' that they might get pardoned
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles
And my cerebral breeds the wickedest evil
Peep facts, in the game so deep fiends could catch a
Got the city drinkin' Cristals, re-up the fee
My rise to riches surprised the bitches: think harder
G.S. the fuck up, dree-ess the fuck up
Watch me shine like a Breitling, Breguets the fuck up
All rhymers forget it like Alzheimer's
Small timers, I said it, I'm addressin' all drama
Talk to me!
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)
"I want money like Cosby" – who wouldn't?
This the kinda talk
That make me think you probably ain't got no puddin'
Niggas got them kinda dreams from jail
You in the streets, nigga, make your moves, get your mail
Niggas'll coast in the SL but can't post bail
Niggas'll, roast a L but, scared to throw your toast, well
There's heaven, then there's hell, niggas
Next day you're sweatin', forgettin' your lies
Alibis ain't matchin' up, bullshit catchin' up
Hit with the RICO, they repo your veh-i-cle
Everything was all good just a week ago
Ready to start snitchin', ain't you?
I'll forgive your weak-ass: hustlin' just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars, honies that shake they ass at bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers, carriers of MAC-millers
East Coast bodiers, West Coast cap-peelers
Little monkey niggas turn gorillas
Stopped in the station, filled up on octane
Slayin' day in and day out
When money play in, then they play you out
Tryin' to escape my own mind, lurkin' the enemy
Representin' infinity with presidencies, you know?
Dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)
Dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)
Dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)
Dead fuckin presidents to represent me (Whose...)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)

I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (whose...)
Rock.. on, Roc-A-Fella y'all
The saga continues.. (what the fuck?)
Ahh, who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce?
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous, all the et ceteras
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat
Fuck 'em, they hate a nigga lovin' his life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin' my life
Hospital days, reflectin' when my man laid up
On the uptown high block, he got his side sprayed up
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said "pray for me"
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
And I ain't got nothin' but time
Three shots, close range, never touched me, divine intervention
Can't stop I, from drinkin' Mai-Tai's, with Ty-Ty
Down in Nevada, ha ha, poppa, word life
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (whose...)
Geyeah, know what?
I'll make, you and your wack mans fold like bad hands
Roll like Monopoly, advance
You're coppin' me like white crystal
I gross the most at the end of the fiscal year than these niggas can wish to
The dead presidential candidate
With the sprinkles and the Presidential, ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime flees my mind
Long as the villain win
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin'
J-A-Y hyphen, controllin', manipulatin'
I got a good life, man, pounds and pence
Catch me swingin' for the fence
Dead presidents, ya know? Uh-huh
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (whose...)
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (whose...)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!)
Ha ha, yeah (ha ha) yeah, so be it
The Soviet, the Unified steady flow
You already know: you light, I'm heavy, roll heavy dough
Your paper falls slow like confetti, mine's a steady grow, perico
My dough flip like Tae-Kwon
Jay-Z the icon, baby, you like Dom?
Maybe this Cristals'll change your life, huh? Roll with the winners
Heavy spinners like hit records: Roc-A-Fella
Don't get it corrected, this shit is perfected
From chips to chicks to strippin' a Lexus
We cakin', you niggas is fakin', we gettin' it done
Crime family, well-connected, Jay-Z
And you, fake thugs is unplugged like MTV
I empty three, take your treasure, my pleasure
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (whose...)
Dead fuckin' presidents to represent me (whose...)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!)

2DopeBoyz we roll deep everybody gather
Coming back in a week, and the weak good

Spit, mad dog in this bitch, foaming at the mouth, is you a man or a mouse?
Sipping Mickey's, while you looking like Mickey trapping it out
That's not a diss, that's really a dope line, and in order to see my vision you
Probably would go blind
I'm chilling with a blonde, she dumb as fuck, but she can suck a bowling ball
Through a straw, that make you tell your mom
I'm just a little nigga trying to make my city proud, I used to watch Doug and wear
My cousins hand-me-downs

We boys in the hood
Pocket full of dubs

Clip full of slugs
If you tryna fuck, baby do your thang
Shake shake it up
Sick of watts you claim, Come and give it up
Baby do your thang
You should already know what I came for
See my, chain hang out
They, gang bang out
West coast my state, left coast my state, you state myspace, internet gangster
Blue Bell jeans on low cut taper
No I can't save ya
Name that captain
Rev up your engines, sound like it farting
I'm in the club sitting with some foreign
She don't speak English words sound retarded
We go hard in that project apartment
Five minutes in Watts, get it started
We boys in the hood
Pocket full of dubs
Homies outta line
Clip full of slugs
Baby here's my number
Shake shake it up
Sick of watts you claim, Come and give it up
Baby I'm a player, Go and hit me up
Baby do your thang
Shake shake it up, shake shake it up, shake shake it up
Sit back relax I'mma give you a walk through, through the city of Watts, through the city of God
Where them bitches shaking that ass, deuce deuce in they bras
Where them niggas rockin' the flash, drinkin' liquor that’s hard
Where they keep the Glock in their pants, chopper's right in the car
And if you step up on the daily's you might leave with a scar
If your gang tight might leave with a broad and like two of her friends might enjoy a ménage
And that's night life, in Watts California
Parties ain't over till like six in the morning
This Hennessey's straight, gotta nigga zoning out
Take another swig then I'm rolling out
If you ain't banging better hold your mouth
Don't claim nothing that you know you're not
Just stick to the script
We boys in the hood
Homies outta line
Clip full of slugs
If you tryna fuck, baby do your thang
Shake shake it up
Sick of watts you claim, Come and give it up
Baby do your thang
Shake shake it up, shake shake it up, shake shake it up
Ahhh! Ahhh!
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
So I kept running
I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got
(In the room, and I run it)
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
But while my loved ones were fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Ay on my momma nigga (R.I.P. Pat Dawg)
I'mma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On my momma doe like
Aye Sounwave turn this shit up nigga
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick ain't free
Ghetto lullaby for every one-day MC
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
Nigga, now R.I.P
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "God!"
Bad trips like, "Yea!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie you fucked up
But if God got us
Then we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reapin' everything I sow, so my karma come
And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record
I'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want, you a house, you a car?
40 acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
You know I'm surgical with this bitch Jake
How you want it dawg?
Closed Casket?
Remember that fool in a wheelchair?
How you think he got there?
I got my air-conditioning on right now
Real cool about it
Oil talking please
Slick with it
Wanna know what death feel like
The scope that I got for the long rifle fit pretty damn right
Plus my connect got a pretty good price
I could take off your neck with just one slice
Of the blade
One cut can have her screaming out first aid
Birthday solution was to shoot straight
Stand on the block taking pay
Not to fuck with K-D-O-T
Oh, I forgot
Never come around here without a Glock
Nigga I put heat on your boy
Leave him tied up on the back seat
With your boy duct taped won't let out noise
Oh yes we got them toys
Oh yes we got them choppas
In the kitchen (in the kitchen)

Got kick (got kick)
You hate (you hate)

Sometimes I just lay back and let them look at me
I'm so [?] too
You see they be loving the oil talk
Its real slick for them
I keep the air conditioning on
Cool, cool, cool)
Run when I flex the steel
Save on the ounce but don't know the price
But I know one time ain't bust late night
Ain't no fucking with it I'ma let em plague mic
I keep a nine for you dummies then I split your brain
I'm going to your safe, take your cash, cocaine
All your weed in your range cause you're going platinum chains
Fuck pity, we gon' do you niggas shitty
Domino effect when we spray them with the semi
Front to back
Stack for stack
Either gat for gat (braaap)
Wise niggas better check my stacks
Stacked, lots of cheese
Cop the keys
To the boss got rocks to feed
Roster fees
Cause ain't nobody stopping me
I got a flow so cold
Style so bold
A nigga run up, I leave his face all swole
And I don't feel bad he put himself in the hole
West coast in motion
Promoting another episode
Down south them niggas get [?] whilst we be getting [?]
This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
All I wanna be was a gunman (Was a gunman)
Shootin’ up the charts, better run, man
Y'all gotta see that I won, man
Slick as El DeBarge with the finger waves, work it, JT
Handle bars like a fade, watch me work it, JT
I'm at large, runnin’ plays like a circuit, JT
I'm sellin' verses, JT, watch me work it, JT
Don't judge me! My mama caught me with a strap
Don't judge me! I was young, fuckin' all the brats
Don't judge me! Aimin’ at your head for a stack
Don’t judge me! If I press your line you a freak
This what God feel like, huh, he-yeah
Laughin' to the bank like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
Flex on swole like, "A-ha!", huh, he-yeah
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
Fuck is you talkin' to?
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous
This what God feel like
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
(This what God feel like)
You feel some type of way, then a-ha!
(This what God feel like)
Huh, he-yeah (This what God feel like)
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need you!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you
Made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear—
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, 100° proof
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you're ashamed of me
Yes, I hate you, too
(Knocking)
House keeping
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Disculpe!
You the reason why mama and them leavin'
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, you can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple
A friend never leave Compton for profit
Or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he would recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, "You fuckin' failed"
You ain't try
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh, ohh
(Breathing)
What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
But remember, he knows the Bible too
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
(I want you more than you know)
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, "You crazy?"
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (want you)
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
You said to me
You said your name was Lucy
I said, "Where's Ricardo?"
You said, "Oh, no, not the show"
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, "Oh, shit"
You said to me
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me, Kendrick
But I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute
Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy
I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract if that’s possible"
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
Registration is out of service
'Cause I (want you)
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave
Go DJ, cause that's my, cause that's my, cause that's my

Murder 101, the hottest nigga under the sun
BLAW one to the throat, you ain't livin' no mo'
I got dimes, just multiply two nickles
From Lisa's to Keisha's down to Nicole's
Got they mind fucked up, they'd sell me their soul
Y'all niggas should already know, I got hoes boy
But you already know that, pimpin'
A baller slash killer like O.J. Simpson
Close to the mic like Scottie Pippen
And I move with the coupe through traffic
Real talk, homeboy, not just rappin'
With the tool, mami know that I practice
Cause when I pull it out, I be shootin' it backwards
I said "Don't worry, finish suckin' me up", oh fo' sho'
Aye [?], they better act like they know what's up
Before I send 'em to the Heaven, let 'em know what's up
And I'm out of y'alls speed cause the flow got gas
Yeah, our shit be the bomb
My suggest, you get your pom poms and cheer
I'm goin' down as the minor of the year
Seventeen, fresh to death, clean, diamonds in my ear
Play with me, have them triple beams aimin' at your rear
Honestly, I'm the mothafucka that niggas fear
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave

Go DJ, cause that's my, cause that's my, that's my
Dave, man, put them niggas in the grave, man
I'm still gettin' that cake, man
Cause my uncle's still pitchin' rocks like a caveman
You snakes, stay far from my home
Before I play Nelly and get my Desert Eagle on
Aim at your belly 'til you throw up your own shit
I'm on my mission to conquer my competition
My ego bigger than Jay-Z, for sure, not a maybe
Just crashed in front of that Bentley, smokin' blunts the bitch with me
She takin' shots in my gymmy, couple back shots I got plenty
Tell her stop, she said gimme, y'all can see that I'm simply
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave
Go DJ, cause that's my, cause that's my, cause that's my
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ Dave
Go DJ, cause that's my, cause that's my, that's my
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
Findin' me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: "Lift up your shirt," because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
Step on his neck as hard as your bullet-proof vest
The good kid, m.A.A.d. city."
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
All I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms
Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane
Society? It's entirely stressful upon my brain
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination, baby
Ill education, baby
Want to reconnect with your elations?
This is your station, baby
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear
"Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!"
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yo self
Hope euphoria can slow dance with society
The driver seat the first one to get killed
At the same burger stand where hang out
Now this is not a tape recording saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine
We adapt to crime, pack a van with four guns at a time
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin up you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' off you suckers, suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from
AK's, AR's, "Aye y'all. Duck"
Aw man, God damn, all hell broke loose
Now crawl yo' head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin'
BGs up to pre-approve, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
M.A.A.d city
"Man down
Where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Every time I'm in the street I hear
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
Real simple and plain
"et me teach you some lessons about the street
It ain't nothin but a Compton thang
Chyea
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two nigga's hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice
Cocaine, weed
Nigga's been mixing shit since the 80's, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds, dip
Make a nigga flip
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
I'm still in the hood
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
Couple of IV's with the fucking spray-can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Shots hit the enemy, harsh turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where motherfuckers stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
They realizing the option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim and
They bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
I live inside the belly of the rough
Good morning america (ahh)
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
Good morning america (ahh)
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
A new revelation
Good morning america (ahh)
Good morning america
The letter K, D-O-T, add a space like a microsoft keypad
You can't see me, invisible ski mask
Poke the eye's out my beanie
Feces shit on niggas, nigga
My flow come in plural
I got the masses, meaning societies public
Low dickey shorts, LA fashion still holding grudges
Ain't forgot y'all killed Pac niggas
Ain't forgot y'all left the West Coast for dead
Instead, we dusted off pulled the bullet out our heads
Left a permanent scar, for the whole world to recognize
California, economics, pay your taxes bitch
New chronic, new [?] spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, New Doc Dre
A new West Coast to Wake up to, Nate
Good morning America
As a new Day Begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I Hope that you're ready
A new revelation

Young kendrick the grown up baby
On enough to acknowledge your fuck ups maybe I spare your life maybe i won't
Maybe I give you the funk
Geroge clintion bring by the sentence like I got a english major in it
This is higher academis pay attention students
Niggas you is you foolin with a hand gun might as well have a harpoon then
I carry two or more with me like im car poolin
Ee miles deep when its beef I dont say get em I say move in

Learn that shit that shit will get you killed
Shit
24/7, 365, Kendrick Lamar is always right on time
Oh, you thought you had me all figured out?
Take it from the horse's mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you the plan B was to win your hearts before we win a Grammy
These days ain't shit changed, different toilet - same shit
Had it been for my past tense I wouldn't be rappin'
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' sure you will agree
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, [bump] your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, you know that it's big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You know you're evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real higga
To give you what you need
Trap our bodies but can't lock our minds
Everybody just stop
(The bigger I shoot)
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me in a chain, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chain full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, just remember that
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Lock our body, can't trap our mind
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be a-
Uh, and when I wake up
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty women and women, and it's the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Everything I know, karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
Wouldn't you know
Lookin' at the world, "Where do we go?"
I'm at the preacher's door
They wanna kill us dead, at the preacher's door
We said give 'em some more
This one time, do it fo' sho
But we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright (hello)
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright (P!)
We gon' be alright (hello)
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want, you a house, you a car?
Acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
You can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can smell it, I know it's illegal
Diggin' in my pocket, candy paint it on the Regal
Everyday my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
I don't talk about it, 'bout it, everyday I see
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
I rap, I'm black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with...
It's been a week already
Feeling weak already
Got me at peak, possibility of what could be
Situation is heavy, I've got to prove
On February twenty sixth I lost my life too
It's like I'm here in a dark dream
Nightmare, hear screams recorded
Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
Why didn't he defend himself? Why couldn't he throw a punch?
And for our community do you know what this does?
Add to a trail of hatred
Twenty twelve was taped for the world to see
Set us back another four-hundred years
This is modern day slavery
The reason why I'm by your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your son jumps into your arms
I'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk
Had the vodka on the top
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
How come I could make it popular?
See I'm living with anxiety
Giving up sobriety
Cussing with his sister
And playing with society
Justice ain't free
Therefore justice ain't me
Try and justify staying, obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Now I'm thinking to myself
Hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinking by myself
Caught you when you walk besides your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
The engine then sped off in a wraith
I said Hiiipower, one time you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us
I don't need the hype
They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libbing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times, they lying to you, they telling a lie
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
My cool is on, she love my A/C
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and how have you laying between the sheets with the Isleys
I push the coupe like a high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno re-winded back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime
Modern-day Issac Hayes, theme song to Shaft
Equivalent to the theme song to your career, study my craft
You ignorant: I do it without a pen and pad
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucker with this music biz
The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Had the bidding war popping like an auction
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my porch
Black diamonds, not no rose-gold shit
Teamed up with Watt's finest
Jay Rock won't you avalanche these niggas so I can rock-climb 'em?
(Jay Rock: Give me a minute my nigga let me go find 'em)
Bring 'em back to me, the 5'6" rap bully is back for the first time, killing you niggas
But where Jigga left off that is where I pick up
I got them holding their breath without having no hiccups
Real niggas: we the last ones left, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar for rapping the West
Cause you see homeboy, we ain't getting respect
So we got to get it back, take it back, to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khakis on
Address the issue in my last three songs
Man, Game know about you West Coast clones
And nigga we hate twins
Put some change on it, see if it makes sense, ya know
I got to be the new breed top 5 minus 4
That's number one, cause second is the first loser
Don't beef with me homey, if you want your future
Rap ain't promised, you might think it's slamming right
But look at Onyx, they ain't too tight
Interscope consults it: look at Suge Knight
I'm trying to get money like the Oasis
If you ain't on the same shit like my gold D's, keep rolling
I keep rolling, never stop
Top Dawg Entertainment: Presents K-Dot
(Top Dawg, Money GANG)
Owwww, Dave, I see you, now see me
Look, I say I'm a millionaire
I'm a Top Dawg millia- no let me just come in unorthodox
I order plenty ammunition for the enemies that I got
I'm the King, I'm just looking for my Coretta Scott
Bet I pop, like a boy band, I'm annoying to rappers
Guess I'm poison to rappers, front on me, get bent backwards
Stepping on em' like a Kappa
Cap and gown, graduated with my Masters
Swear there is none after
And you don't want to get caught in the rapture
I would probably burn your whole colony
Chew you up then spit you out
Your nothing but a Polla Seed
Follow hood policies
Compton, California where the motherfuckin' riders be
You never seen a killer til you seen one on side of me
That green on the side of me
Fuckin' all about my fuckin' money like Assadomy
Fuck them bitches properly
I do it
I do it, done it run it like I grown legs by the hundreds
My pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry
Bummy, NEVER
Middle of a conversation, I cough up a feather
And get ready for the detonation
I bomber whoever
Whatever you bout, I'm bout it twice like a woman who give twins life
I steered right through your fan base every time
Tapping your demographic like I was Gregory Hines
I'm a beast, fuck a mansion, I rather live in a cave
Sasquatch is back, but what y'all really didn’t know is I sasquatch can rap
Motherfucker I'm iller
There's some boy named K Dot and he's a maniac!
I think his vocals is strapped, with a toolie in fact
He spit like a Uzi, rat-tat-tat
He just shot me in my back, somebody pick up my back
I think that boy from Iraq , I think y'all boys better know that
Heading straight for the top like a ball cap
Ain't one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain off top
Bet she goggle like a scuba diver eyes in the sea
Recognize who I be, K. Dot motherfucker
Dot motherfucker, hot motherfucker, drop top when ya popped with the Glock
When I go pop pop
Everybody know I be where the money lie, eat where the money lie, shit where the money lie, sleep where the money lie
Rappers: I'm iller
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
(Smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga)
Where are we going, we should be slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
That’s what she said to me, that place I used to call home
We don’t even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile I’m in these streets with everybody, I’m trying to get it
And she know they got me, I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
Where are you going, we should be growing now
That’s what it said to me, but the place I call ambition
Like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
Fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out but I'm 'bout to drop the ball
I’m calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me come to the studio but I wanna tell him, nah
Where are you going, we should be growing now
That’s what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven's unfair to me, only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don’t know
I know to follow Him rather following people
Guess I’m following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don’t need you
Where are we going, why are we slowing down
Where are you going, we should be growing now
So in conclusion
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Tryna visualize how to get it right but my vision’s so blurry
Tryna slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we’re always in a hurry now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we’re getting closer
I think we’re getting closer
What I look like, a sucker to you, nigga?
Fuck you, rookie
Somethin' incredible, heh-heh-heh
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Turn that shit up, boy, bump that shit
Nigga, hold a handgun and dump that shit
Nigga, buy that borough and fuck that bitch
And kick her out before the sun come up
Nigga, my funds is up
Business movin' like New York City lights
Bitches all over that boy
Cause they know that young boy got a cold strut
But I don't fuck with them hood rats, they'll set you up
And I ain't goin' out just like that
I'd rather go out over a shoot-out, plow
Every sunshine got a hood under it
And you know we Marilyn Jones runnin' that shit
My bones made out of cement, strong arm
Explode on y'all, Vietnam, boom
Heh-heh-heh, okay, I'm ready, ha-ha
A thousand for the jeans, three hundred for the kicks, bitch
I was born with diamonds in my wrist
Straight nasty, don't walk past me
I just might grab it, just might pull a blade out and stab it
I would kill it only if you say
I'm more than willin' to take advantage
Legs to the ceilin', ho, throw away your panties
I take 'em, then I perform magic
Head on the freeway, seatbelt fastened
And go and tell the DJ to play my shit
You never heard nothin' like this, yuh
They say, "Who that?" K. Dot, no roof, new top
They hate, they watch, speed down the block
In a shoot-out with anybody that you got
.45, no lie, no problem
If he got his jewels on, I'm a Black Rob him
Nigga, I'm a bad boy, I'm a black ski mask, boy
"Tell me where the safe or this'll be the last time
That you ever have a gun in your face"
Might be the last time that somebody run in your place
I'm 2Pac, I'm inferno, I'm so hot, no chicken
Tell it to the Colonel Sanders, do it for that Compton campus
Heh-heh, I'm done with the fourth quarter
Shit, psych, Rock, get 'em
Fresh new spinners on the 'Lac
Never knew Rock could do it like that
I'm a mack for real, I hit more pussy than Vagisil, yeah
Who got this game in a chokehold?
Pack up and quit cause we the shit
Plus, that Calico hold more shells than El Pollo Loco
Turn you to a dough salt
Take your ho to the mo-mo quick
She want to bounce up and down on my pogo stick
Me n' Dot spit raw, deejays,  Mr. Miyagi
You come frontin', get slammed like Onyx
Leave your block smokin' like a luau
Top Dawg E-N-T, bitch
We told you, heh-heh-heh, we told you, ah
Top Dawg, nig, we told you, nigga done did it
That’s where you headed boy, to pine oil heaven. I'mma get that gun, and then I'mma get that money. I don’t believe you got it in you, Jake. I'mma go get it right now (gunshot) Oh shit, awwwww you motherfucker! The next one will kill you. Ohh, son of a bitch. You shot me in the ass
I never been a bitch in my life, I never ran from a fight
I was told when niggas bark you should bite
And these puppies ain’t eatin' enough pedigree to scare something
Calf and stomach, you grabbin' the hand of a woman
I never took the stand, snitched on my man and came back home Like it was nothin', actin' like I ain’t do somethin' wrong
Fuck it, and if I did i would look 'em in the face
Tell hop out that bucket and spray
Tell 'em to make sure they hit my head and my waist
Tell them to circle round the block twice in case
Shit, cement pump in my veins, hard body to the death
Scream fuck the world with a capital F
And this is how we think
No tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And if y'all bodies was then y'all be built for war
Tell em'
No teddy bear niggas around me
Just a hundred cement niggas around me
We hard bodied, y'all bodies ain’t like ours
And it’s passed on like a ritual, not sworn in it
Walkin' down the block, K in my hands, fuck it, who want it?
I got a hundred shots for any one of you blood clots
Motherfucker, we will fuck ya
I’m no gimmick, we smell out the timid
You either fall now or stand with it
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, bloaw, you’re too late
Motherfucker, meet your fate
Look between my eyes
And my burner from the four fifth which is the four five
Which is that ninety-five Jordan shit
Jordans on your feet, we gon' take them shits
Put them on our feet and reshape them shits
Now don’t they look sweet?
You talkin' ass backwards like criss cross pockets
Mel Gibson, you just actin'
Lethal weapon, I take you niggas to target practice
Won’t you listen when a grown man is lecturin' you?
Cause any weapon will do in the process of fuckin' up you, nigga
You rappers ain’t built like us
Y'all just lift a lot of weights and look tough
We see through that, we shoot through anything that’s buff
And we ain’t thinkin' about handcuffs
The police runnin' from us, we so hard bodied, trust
Tongue tissue ass niggas man, ay wait, we say, either go hard or go home, tha- tha- tha- that’s what we go by, either stand for something or fall for anything nigga, bite that, o- open your mouth, bite that go ahead, you’re suicidal
Yeah, , oh fuck, I’m winning anyway, I’m winning, I’m winning any mother fuckin' way, I can’t lose
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you leave 'em what you tell 'em (Bye hater, bye hater)
Kkk Dot bitch
Damn I'm fly, ain't I bitch
Don't tell me, don't smell me
Since you say that I ain't shit
I be with those Benjamins
Like he was my sidekick
Welcome to our private affair
Where, the narrow be right here
Where, the bitches be right here
22 here, you you
Won't you change your life boo
Together we can slide through
Midnight, Murcielago, loud pipes
Make sure that that head right, damn right
I be on that other shit make them want to curse my government
Dayum, hate the game, hate on me
And I'm loving it
I'm bouncing with a couple models sipping on that bubbly
I'm talking 'bout them yellow bottles with that bucket under it
So they know you [?]
God damn it I'm nice (I know)
And I see a lot of haters in this room
I just look them in they face, then I say what's up to 'em
Pull up in something brand new
Sipping on that goosey goose
I see some haters in this room
So we tell 'em I love you
Pull up in something brand new
Sipping on that goosey goose
We got some haters in this room
You, make, my life complete
I wonder where would I be
If it wasn't for you
Ugh, check out the denim bitch
That with the dictionary can't even pronounce it
Don't worry bout the name
Compton, California
Home of them p-public houses
Where the beast live
And you can hear the city growlin'
Maserati prowlin'
Humping on your neighbourhood corner
Every time a nigga come through they be mad then a motherfucker
That's when I reached in my bag and I throw more cash like a motherfucker
3 words for them in the club every time I hear them come
Fuck them motherfuckers
Damn right, I could put that on my life
I use their negative energy for my appetite (hungry)
100 horsepower in my car
They see me when I see them then I say
What up homie?
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you leave 'em what you tell 'em (Bye hater, bye hater)
Live from the area code of 310
Knapsack full of goodies, black hoodie, [inaudible]
Fully detach bullets from their own egos, see no evil
Who the hottest out? I'm a give 'em a heat stroke
Summertime, wearin' a peacoat
I be the baddest to ever put a lyric on top of an apparatus
Now trip, that's our flip, I'm a savage
Fabulous wordplay
Be very afraid, I'm nasty with it
Born out the ass of a dragon, flamin', shitted on the masses
This harassment came from Kendrick, givin' out caskets
Puttin' these rappers in it, you fit the image of a dead man
Hennessy and chronic in the same night, so what?
Eyes red like a twelve o'clock fight
My nigga, what it look like?
Niggas hatin', bitches hatin', babies dyin'
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killin' no cure
Oil spillin', turmoil, poverty-stricken, police brutality
Kickin' ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, Botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starvin', these commercials keep us buyin'
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion
See that's forbidden, we fryin'
My nigga, what it look like?
That's exactly what Hell look like
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!
My nigga, what it look like?
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spittin'
Children playing, angels praying, 14 karat golden streets, collard greens
Red wine, potato yams, turkey legs, calling every human being...
Burning bullets allowing these walls breaking
Devour these laws trying to empower me
I thought I knew the reason you grew to love sour diesel
Smoking like locomotive your focus was hourly
And then you caught me your pity party had towered me
I doubt that you listen, it’s stuck in your system I tried
Soaking up life’s reality this is the visual
Baby daddy a light build blade walking with highheel
Paid stalking that avenue, never knew how the light feel, I
Got a plan got a plan for ya
I just just might hold a couple bands for ya
And leave this message in the sand for ya
She said naw nigga it’s part of the game
Just like Heroin
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Please stay paced and the ground need you right on time
Say, you right on time
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God, please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time
Runaway from the fire, I fly downhill
Lay your head over this side, now
You keep pain on the inside, now
Whats been eating you, who's been needing you
You been keeping it down, and
You been taking me higher and higher
Chasing history’s baddest, I mastered this apparatus
Rackin' my brain, I'm scared of being average
Going against the grain just tryna maintain my savage
And foolish of me to let her do it, I love calamity
I love a challenge, naw I love the fantasy
Connect the dot nigga this is fate
I'm talking predestination
I'm talking blind dedication
Plan B is contraception we didn’t make it
Sexercise a little bit of patience
The love of the rush is us
I'm addicted to violence, helicopters, and sirens
Blood pressure is skying, nigga I'm trying
Heroin
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, right on time
Please stay paced and ground need you right on time
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time
And you could never get a dime baby (Never get a dime)
It's hard to come home (Hard to come home)
It's hard to come home (Hard to come home baby)
She my gift and my curse, she really quenching my thirst
She know my thoughts, pleasures, and pain
Everybody love her and she love everybody the same
I might hold a couple bands for ya
Leave a message in the sand for ya
Nigga it's just like heroin
I don’t know when I’ll be going back to Cali
I don’t know when I’ll be going back too, kay?
Skkrt skkrt, pulling up, G5 land in the valley
I don’t know, I don’t like ‘em if they got some flaws
I don’t know, I don’t like ‘em, this is big bruhK-D-O-T, TDE
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Section.80, HiiiPoWeR
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the mothafuckin' pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's web is going to miss you
My issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
While you mothafuckas waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uhh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh
Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard
He probly clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on the field full of land mines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping I blow up in time
Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Tryna be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Every day we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring is crazy
Product of the late 80's
Pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, throw a Molotov, somebody told me them pirates had got lost
Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs
Just call the shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR
Thug Life! Thug Life!
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
Everybody know I spit that other shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and weave
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
Cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
I'm on five, you saying that I can level more?
In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Creation of man, and Columbine
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
Just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
They're new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted, like 40 gays
My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
So my momma can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me, like "My son's 'bout to win
Somehow, someday, and I don't care when"
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale, like an atheist
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I'll take you back to the 9th grade
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
That's my nigga, he a street nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders
Just underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T
Laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks
Now what you 'bout? Nothing huh
Am I a square cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers give me H.O.C
(Bitch I'm blowed!)
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn’t stop survivor’s guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man, maybe I’m just another nigga
I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga
Fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
I know you dying to meet him, I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit popping — Section.80
With my back against the wall
And your bitch on the edge of my dick—jump off!
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddling
With the speed of a lightning bolt
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven
From a distance don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? there's no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't a option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin' —
Hey, hey, kick her out the studio, Ali
24/7, nigga working his ass for it, she popping that ass for
They checking my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
When you pushing a RAV4, you wrecking my Jaguar
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't an option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga
I wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor
Hol' up
Bu parçayı yerden 30 bin feet yüksekte yazdım
Hostes sert saçım üzerinden bana iltifatta bulunuyor
Eğer onu bütün bu yolcular karşısında becerebilseydim
Beni muhtemelen bir terörist sanarlardı
Kuşkonmazımı yiyin, sonra hostese genç bir zencinin düşüncelerini soruyorum
Hızlı gelen para ve özgürlük
Muhtemelen bir dakika içinde öleceğim
Beni sadece 20 sürtük, 20 milyon ve üzerinde Compton yazan bir şapka ile gömün
Bekle
Bekle
Bekle
Evet, büyük şeyler oluyor
Section 80
Bu sürtüğe geri döndüm, sürtüğün arkasında, arkam duvara dayalıyken ve senin kaltağın sikimin sınırlarında, kalk üstünden
Bir sürtüğe sürtük, bir kaltağa kaltak ve bir bayana bayan derim
Asfaltın üzerindeyken yeri kırmak dışında bir şey yapmadım
Lastik izleri sana bir şimşek hızı ile satış yaptığımın kanıtlarını verir
Bir çocuk olarak iki yetişkin öldürdüm, ben çok gelişmişim
20 li yaşlarımı 2 yaşımdayken yaşadım, akıllı adam
Gerçeği söylemek gerekirse 87 yaşında gibiyim
80 din adamı kadar kötüyüm
Alev dolu bir havuzda şeytanın elini tutuyorum
Bir mesafeden bakınca hangisinin Hristiyan olduğunu ayırt edemiyorum, kahretsin
2012'de kime güvenebilirim ki?
Kimseye, kendime bile güvenemem
İkizler yardım çığlığı atıyor
Ayağa Kalksın
Ayağa Kalksın
Ayağa Kalksın
Evet, büyük şeyler oluyor, herkes izliyor

Evet, büyük şeyler oluyor
24/7 zenci bu iş için kıçını yırtıyor
Kız ise bu yüzden ona kıçını sallıyor
Elmaslarıyla birlikte Elmasların Kralı (Ünlü bir striptiz klübü)
Bunun için hiç sormadım
Pasaportumu kontrol ediyorlar
Gümrüğe alışkınım
Hostes polisi çağırıyor
Onu öldürdüm, birisi bağlasın
Oyunu ileri sarmamı istiyorlar
Ve önceden de fakir olmanıza rağmen neden şikayet ediyorsunuz
RAV4 sürerken benim şeritime geçemezsin
Jaguar'ımı parçalıyorsun
Kötü davranışlar sergiliyorsun
Onun ayağı gösterge panelinin üzerinde
Bekle
Evet, büyük şeyler oluyor, herkes izliyor
Bu işi böyle yaptığın sürece zenci, kaybetmek ihtimal bile değil

K-Dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Don't tell me they got you on some weirdo rap shit, nigga?
No socks and skinny jeans and shit, ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!

14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies

My lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Your homeboy, your block that you're from, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
On the dead homies
Hopped out the Caddy, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called and said, "the enemies done cliqued up"
Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas names on paper, you snitched all summer
Streets don’t fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, set trippin’ all around
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"
Obama say, "What it do?"
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We was in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies
On the dead homies
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y’all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Don’t ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don’t ask about my bitch, no, don’t ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
Had the Coast on standby
I box ‘em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said "it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game"
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
Back in the city
Uh, now tell me who it is
K-Dot, young kid runnin' the music biz
You tell me what's worse
Me bein' the best rapper or rappers dyin' of thirst?
I'm just like a gun-clapper with these words
And you know I'm packin'
And that word is meant for Janet Jackson
I'm a black hippy, that's what I know
I wear a heart black, I love peace, that's my clothes
And so, and I don't know this name
(Steve Buscemi, he's the actor, man)
Thank you for that ad-lib, G
Next thing you know, I google him up, it might be me
I hope he's rich, I hope he's contra
Band in my pocket, no, I don't have sponsors
Don't want the police to come in this place
Because I might run and I run this race
That's in the rap game
You got some more words, I go absurd
I got nouns, I got more verbs, this is the curb
I swing, my nigs, I flip flows
I come from the West, I do it the best
I don't stress, no contest
Any rapper want to come see with Rickey Smiley?
And beat they ass and take they cash
And then we stab, off in that Jag
I give 'em, they see me, I give them blushes
I'm talkin' Halle Berry, Stacey Dash
But she vote for Mitt Romney
No, I don't want that ass
I'm talkin' Obama, I'm talkin' more drama
Nah, that's Ebony Steele, that's me, for real
That means she's confident, that means she's beautiful
That mean she got no dirt in the cuticles
That means she got that watch
Shirley Caesar, left seat, man
After forty years, they'll sweep her in through the city
That's Compton, everybody don't want none
I got the people in the back straight cheerin'
K-Dot, Kendrick Lamar, got mad heart
Got my hood on for Trayvon Martin
Freedom, justice, you know we gon' be started
Get the party started every time we come through flippin'
Flamin' Hot Cheetos I'm eatin'
I'm skippin' across L.A., that's somethin' that we do
Each and every day, hangin' with my crew
Throw another word, watch how I observe the train
Matter of face, where's my girl, Sherane
And when I say "train", that don't means that I flip her
Yeah, we did toss, turn just like Flipper
My favorite cartoon, you know
Got to go with Bugs Bunny Cartoon Show
Give me nouns and verbs, what I spit is absurd
The Finals, the Heat, yeah, they came with the Heat
Another word, homie, you give me what you got
Who kills my vibe? The haters, the groupies
The Hoovers in the streets, they try to shoot me
I move with heat, you never can stop me
The best strip club, it's down Atlanta, it's down Miami
I stay with the (?), I say, "What's up, shawty?"
You got your girl, I don't like fake ass, I need a referral
I see everybody twerkin'
Even Miley Cyrus got that motherfucker workin'
You can never stop me, The Rickey Smiley Show
I'm here, I'm here, I'm lettin' people know
The better celebrity female in the game
I like Rihanna, who else could complain?
I love, I can't even say the word
But I'm cussin' and I don't need to pronounce a verb
The Black Hippy is the crew, we do what we do
We stay in the booth, we do it, we shoot
We straight for the stars, you know just who we ares
We ride in Buicks, then we pushin' the flashy cars
I'm a flow all day, this The Rickey Smiley Show
Just to let you know, we still 'bout to go
They bring me in, they show love with the crew
Rickey Smiley Show, huh, you know what it do, what's up?
Yeah
You're now rockin' with the best
Hub City's threat
Minor of the year
K. Dot
Ooh, it's about to get so ugly in here
It's about to get so ugly
Like whoever's listening to this
Oh man I crack myself up
Yeah
Oh my God man, oh my God
We 'bout to shit on these faggots man
Check it
Yeah, K. Dot
*Let me get that*
First niggas used to rapping, get my attention
Now I don't even listen
It run through one ear and out the other
And I don't buy niggas records for music
I'm more interested in their album covers
I'm a talented brotha
Plus I move so quick it's like my brain came with a joystick
Motherfuckers better listen when I spit
I knock records out the park
Homeboy I Ken Griffey a hitch, and I might Ken Griffey ya bitch
But won't buy her shit, not even a small bag of chips
Just give her long pipe 'til it's scrapin' her hips
Like a waitress, the way the broad ask for the tip
If you want, just ask for a clip
I'll give ya those for free
I won't charge a fee
Just roll up on you, like cut off sleeves
Nobody can cut off the-
Blowin' through Nintendo cartridges
To Maybachin it, valet parkin' it
Now people arguin'
Who is better? Them or him
Him referring to me
Them referring to the industry
Hands down, Jay left, now give me the crown
Fuck later, I'm takin' it now
Fuck haters, I'm takin' 'em down
With the red beam, red beam, silencer, don't holler it muffle the sound
Bark like ten rottweilers straight from the pound
Straight for the dollas, 745 [?] Impala, scrapin' the ground
I suggest you follow, or not be smarter
Seein' another broke tomorrow
You can tell the way I speak begins to stutter
First it was hard for y'all to even makin' it harder
Ain't about money, then please don't bother
Y'all niggas funny, talkin' bout that you run shit
When I'm lookin' at ya like "Who are ya?"
Y'all niggas is gas
And what make that bad is y'all niggas is trash
Y'all don't wanna see me spaz
Out, pull the gats out
And see me blast, ouch
You better off coppin' a pen and a pad
Than copyin' the last rhymes I had
And spit 'em to your homeboys 'till they all say "You wrote that?"
It don't matter 'cause in a minute, imma be chargin' my raps
A G for a bar, that's 3 16's, plus a 8 bar hook nigga, add up that
I charge you a verse like Dre would charge you a track
Your whole budget, hoes love it
Nigga, face it, you can't walk in my shoes nor change the sides tryna replace it
As far as rap, I spit in the Matrix
Past reality, nigga actually, I wrote a rhyme where there was no gravity
That's a whole 'nother planet
For real holmes, I do damage
Blow up ya city, even ya school campus
Let it blast
One gun subtractin' ya life, now that's the basics of math
Oh my God man let me stop spazzin' out on these niggas, b
They have to call 911, I'm done
Dave, you feel me man? It's real
K. Dot man, just havin' a lil fun up here man
It's real ugly, ya know?
Yeah, bang, bang, let's go
Hesitation (to get in them pants)
Come closer baby (so I can touch)
One question, am I moving too fast?
Cause' I ain't leaving alone feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
But I don't wanna waste my time
Temptation (is calling your name)
Sweet persuasion, oh (baby this is a game)
Come closer baby (if you like what you hear)
Cause' I ain't leaving alone, I feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
But I don't wanna waste my time
Aha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch but your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die in it
Then reincarnate as a fly gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
State your name, live in the moment
She tell me that she never get a first let away
And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them bittracks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we die in it
Or waste our time, baby it's alright
Oh it's alright now
I don't wanna waste my time, no
I don't wanna waste your time, babe
I don't wanna waste our time, oh my time, oh whoa, now
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? (oh yeah)
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time (come with me baby)
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good, we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time, waste my time
No no no, I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
"20 on 6," he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
Asked me for ten rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
He begged and pleaded
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more"
Tell me; how much a dollar cost?
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
He's starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
And this particular person just had it down pat
"Have you ever opened up Exodus 14?
A humble man is all that we ever need"
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, the one you love
All you need, the air you breathe
Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at him and said, "Every nickel is mines to keep"
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God"
I washed my hands, I said my grace
What more do you want from me?
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change to right my wrongs
K. Dot
Watch how K. Dot move, something not like you
Watch how K. Dot move, something not like you
Have your gun by you, 'cause niggas will try you
Who's sick as me?
And as far as my eyes can see
And let real business get dealt
You ladies man like Leon Phelps
I pee on any man tryna discontinue my health
I don't give a damn on how you feel or how you felt
Your small mercy won't help
When shots circle around your waist like designer belts
I design your face, the [?] lift ya up
Rock niggas like Bobby Boucher, you waterboy
What you want, weed, dope, or water, boy?
It's right here, and y'all catch up, I move fast like light years
Now it's back to the basics
K. Dot's nothing to play with
My grade point average at the top of the brackets
I'm sick like a cancer patient
Assist many players like personal agent
Y'all as foul, clothes to fragrance
I'm the best now
So hand down whatever you had
Like you been in a bag
Put it in garbage or trash, I'm the best you had
K. Dot, so heaven sent
7,6,5
4,3,2

I kick a funky friendly conversation that keep they mind racin'
You can't complain about the flow I got
I let my thoughts space out with the astronauts
Like the white boys say, "Pass the pot"
Let me smoke for a minute...
As god as my witness, I never abuse this hip hop
I'll never pretend to be something I'm not
Giving you something to rock to other than hardcore rap, possible
Not being focused with your eyes open
They say 90% of humans don't even notice
Without you knowing people was laughing at you
They say the worse scenario is when they have to catch you
You wake up out of your mind, your whole thoughts is baffled
You're doing things like trying to touch your shadow
Now here's some realistic, is it something that can happen or is it just a gimmick
You never know until your bear witness
Bear witness...
Bear witness...
She came over, you fucked
She left and you hopped in the truck, you
Took your shirt off cause outside was burning up, you
Skirted off turned your beat up but your gun was tucked
Under the seat, you headed to long beach
Hop on the 710 the carpool lane
Only cause you got black tint and they can't see a thing
Your check engine light popped up, its feeling like bad luck or what not
But one lane before you got there your car stopped
Stop
If your was listening for the past two minutes
Then you just made accurate 90% hypnosis
Now you got a body
Put your lips on top of me
You gots to be the baddest bitch I've ever seen in my life
Your girl look better than you
Imma go hard, so fucking hard till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking arm
Whip the wood grain, whip the wood grain till I break the blood vessel out my motherfucking palm
Break the blood vessel out their motherfucking eye everytime I ride by and they're looking at the charm
I laugh at em like that, with my seat laid all the, all the way to the back
And the heat lay right, right, right under that
Clap, clap, brr, brr, that's the sound of my gat
That's the sound of a 100 round drum, like a marching band, I'm a stand up guy
I'mma pump my fist, I'mma wave my hand until I get the attention of the president, pussy
Presedential suite, laying in, laying in nothing but money
Reminds me of Buffy, please remind me to fuck her after this freestyle
100 carat, nigga I'm the golden child
Full metal jacket, shit, going pow, pow
Blow your brains out, let it hang out, let the neighbors talk about it, then skip trial
I'll fuck em up, cut em up, shoot em in the foot, or just gun butt em up
Now, I'm on some other shit, we ain't on the same page
You ain't sticking to the script
Let a 100 round clip stick to your lip like Carmex
Blood or crip, I don't give a fuck bout none of that
All of y'all can get it, homeboy, it's more than rap
Training Day, I teach you niggas how to rap
I rap like I got angels on my back
God given, I never walk in the booth without the Holy Spirit
I kick, lyrics like Jet Li
Which produce money to put your boy on the beach
Shit, sand in my feet
Tell me what the fuck you know bout me
Welcome to the wild side, Hub city's wild side
Where tecs fly that's homicide, my stacks like a mile high
Fly as a bitch, got a condo on cloud 9
Slap box with God, jump off heaven and skydive
From 5-6 with five nines two mac-10s and Glock nines
Lets do this however whenever tell em I'm ready
Waters run deep way before Katrina broke the levee
Look partner, I'm no gangster, I'm no killer
But please believe I know plenty gangsters that'll kill ya
I don't like you, I don't feel ya you're very unfamiliar
That's not your favorite rapper in the booth
That's a dead corpse once K.dot kick chaos
Niggas bitch off like canines click up and click, click, click boom
Smell the fumes on my Levis
Bitches poppin' pills and mushrooms in my hotel rooms
I squeeze dick through their thick thighs then bounce like this beat from T.Dot
Six T.Vs in my new SUV F-U-C-K-Y-O-U pay me
Genesis ain't shit, I know local henchmen
Come shoot me I'm in a two seater with hootie, motherfucker
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Hub city's wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Hub city's wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Hub city's wild side
Where tecs fly, that's homicide
My stacks like a mile high
Nobody pray for me
It's been that day for me
Way (Yeah, yeah)
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I’m countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin’ this
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
It's levels to it, you and I know
Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)

Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all
Bitch, be humble (Hol' up, bitch)

Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody...
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(One two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother

Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And (I love myself)
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy
One day at a time
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front)
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Look at me motherfucker I smile-
And (I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
(I love myself)
Illuminated—
All ya'll come to the front, ya'll come up to the front
(I love myself)
(Crazy, what you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
So I promise this, nigga
(I love myself)
When you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't seem shy

Huh (Walk my bare feet) Huh (Walk my bare feet)
Huh (Down, down valley deep) Huh (Down, down valley deep)
(I love myself) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum)
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
Not on my, not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vic— TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?
This—, this year alone
Exactly, so we ain't got time to waste time my nigga
Niggas gotta make time bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time right?
The judge make time so it ain’t shit
It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog
You know that
Exac— enough said, enough said
And we gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you saying: "Fuck niggas"
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats"
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive
We're livin' in a gold bar (Runnin' to the right law)
Duckin' in the trap (Duckin' in the trap)
Livin' in a group (Livin' in a group)
Dedicated to the homies in the pen, hit me
(Hey, hey, hey)
Uh, this is a word premiere, this is a world premiere
(Hey, hey)
Uh, I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil want to put me in a bow-tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yeah, yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfucker want to down me
But an amigo never drowned me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And I love myself
Ho, when you're lookin' at me, uh, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, it ain't that high
I love myself
Uh, one day at a time sun gon' shine
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Or let the paranoia haunt you (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confident
I love myself
When you're lookin' at me, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
I love myself
Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy, don't seem shy
I love myself
One day at a time sun gon' shine
Want to say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
(These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation)
Aw, man, I duck these cold faces, post a fee-fi-fo-fum basis
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
Strong in me, I still smile
I love myself
Uh, when you're lookin' at me, uh, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't be shy
One day at a time sun gon' shine
Everybody, hit me
Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)
Fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum)
My heart undone (My heart undone)
Aw, man, ay, check this out
You feel what I'm talkin' 'bout? You dig that?
Sometime I just feel a little bit b-beside myself
This here's the return of Enoch
And we gon' do it to y'all like this
Here we go, one, two, three, hit me
I love myself
The world is a ghetto with big guns and Dickies signs
I love myself
But it can do what it want whenever it want and I don't mind
I love myself
He said I got to get up, life is more than suicide
I love myself
One day at a time, the sun gon' shine
Don't nobody call a medic
I've been dealin' with depression
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
Evident I'm movin' at a meteor speed
Finna run into a buildin' there
Pass me to the buildin' of the holy unseen
Pass me to the feelin' of the holy unseen
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh, woes be me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry
YG, chicken wings, I love myself
I love myself, I love myself
Aw, man, ay, ay, homie
I told you it's straight up a Compton thing
You dig what I'm talkin' about?
And this here's dedicated to the homies
Y'all feel what I'm sayin'?
Sometimes I just get besides myself
The return of the Enoch is back
You hear what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Uh, I've been lookin' for you my whole life
Where you reside?
In a woman, is it in money or mankind?
Something's got me losin' my mind
Where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the dirtiest pistol
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day
I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is
I could preach for you with the mighty tongue
I'm the one, how can I overcome
Negative energy, more like infinity, and survive?
See y'all don't understand me
My plan B is to win ya hearts before I win a Grammy
You can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I've been there and gone before you get near it
Ooh wee, that boy remind me of a young Martin Luther
Like Malcolm X did, I stand for what I believe in
Family, God and honor
From Chicago, my daddy and my momma
Came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, reign supreme, named Kendrick
I ain't lying, it stand for king and I am one
From the coochie to the soil
The meek shall inherit the Earth
Muscle in my heart
Stare at the eyes of Mozart, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
Cause I means this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of Satan
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me
Damn that boy good
Bright as Thomas Edison, but Gucci man hood
You can shoot shots or cheer cause I... am
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
Little brother only 5, momma put him on my taxes
That every section 8 tenant is familiar with
Ooh wee, they say he something like the 70s
You got 80 sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
That was '05 bro
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A million bucks, and that's why
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it (Ho)
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp
And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
You-you niggas check this cash and I'm GT crashing
105 off-ramp, hey
And little nigga got it going on, G5
Going, going, going, gone
Cloud 9 mind state
Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck skip to Y
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it
First off I'm a rider, bitch
Put them 26's on a Silverado, bitch
Snap my fingers, she'll go find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product 'round town, Frank Lucas
Ok, Subway bread like some cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti
Fuck you, pay me. Paper over pussy, nigga
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition of cool is
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Now I prefer women with some sexy toes
With no corns but enjoys eating vegetables
Seem like everybody love the role of assholes
But I'm feeling better being crowned with some bad hoes
Mr. Michael of Amish yo speaking
I hear they fell in love with my penis
Only concerned with my balls like Venus
Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot
Say, I'm big time, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch
And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock
Co-co-co-cock that, aim and shoot that sure shot
U-N-I, T.D.E. be doing it so go head and hop
On that bandwagon of my genitals, not new to me
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this
Oh Lord, here he come, there they go again
Kendrick got my cover fire, bitch I'm going in
Burn a swisher up, then I roll again
Ee-Jay and Weezy, just make sure that dough keep rolling in, hah!
Got the world going crazy
Big chrome .380 if a nigga try and play me
Never been like you or wanted to be, I do me
She found out that I'm in a group, now she's a groupie
Don't need a watch that's full of diamonds to know that it's perfect timing
Yeah, keep it simple stupid, all I see is trendy all around me
T.D.E. the movement, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County
Country accent, city fashion, lights are flashing on the cameras
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Bitch, I do this
These hoes want to love me, man
So I'm like, what up? Uh what up?
Uh, bitch I do this remix stupid, fire burning, people looting
That's the chaos, comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging nooses
Call me hot or call me Pac, every eye on me and it's obviously
I'm close as next to kingdom come, I just run my city dude
You just make your city run, they hate to be next to you
I'm 'bout to make that halo burn, now goddamn that's some irony
I am the messiah of society
Beside a Halle Berry, feed me berries in Paris, oui-oui
I carry on a great endeavor, ambition leave all men grief
Like beliefs of Mason Betha, reporting from C-P-T motherfucker
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition what cool is
Bitch, I do this
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Who say West Coast niggas don't know anything about real hip-hop?
I'm 'bout to give you a prime example
Where my nickels and dimes at?
.45's Mac 10's and nines at?
If its 12 of you, shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer
You wanna die? I can help you
Put the rap beef aside and [?] the content of the street shit to the block, parental advised
Mike Jordan in his heyday
Call me Jeff Gordon in that hard top swerving in between the lines
Uncle Bobby's still incarcerated, Grandma died in Vegas
Grandpa moved to Mississippi
I really can't tell if dude missed me
Probably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to his earlobe
More reason why my heart cold
Prior to a lot of hatin' going, Feds raided the studio
We tryna do songs, but they ain't listen
Why you had to do that for?
I wish Pro Tools was on record
I know I'm walking the path of greatness, no compass
Not Atheist, but the bars reside with Satan
Chokin' the mic, releasing my frustration
Rather do that before I catch court cases
Locked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic
Boxed in like a new Porsche rollin'
Stones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen
K. Dot's in my colon
Modern day war victim
Oh, I'm foul, come join my coalition
No snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant
Feel relentless, new apprentice
King of, comprehension
No competition
Compton's back, pump your fist like this and that
No sumbliminals, I'm listenin', face the facts
You're a disgrace to this rap business
Just a one-man office, you need assistance
Gun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors
And anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question
Gave you the rhyme scheme before you're English-education
I say I'm better than most that say they're the ones that gave 'em swag
The flow, the artist development
Am I who gave you the growth?
You didn't bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed
The sun shine, and now king me
Kodak moment that's been captured, cheese
Lord forgive me
Kill him where he stand and stand over him
Shake his hand then jump back in that minivan
Double back to his block and blam
I ain't backing down for nothing
I'ma back 'em down like Shaq
With this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Coroners comfort your momma
"Momma, he's dead," the next morning
I toasted up with my homies, we drink and smoke marijuana
Want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from
Uncles that raised me in Compton
I don't know, I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumping
On enemies; I'm head huntin', no sympathy, ain't no love
When you in these streets, just get something
Protect your neck 'cause they coming
For sets, respect, split your onion
Then chop your deck
Your head tumbling like gymnastics (Ooh...)
'Cause ignorance is bliss
Now everybody put your hands up high
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, I'll dish off
Then peel off in a hooptie
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably, I'm too street—indubitably, I'ma do me
Better than your bitch would, 'cause you niggas too weak
But just give me two weeks and I'm good
I'll make an album that'll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven's talent
No tarot card reading; I'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm including the planet
Cats so watered-down clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around their neck and watch 'em panic
Give me respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently, you're a parrot, mocking me and my blueprint
But I won't share it just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only calling me Kweli and Common?
Now everybody put your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put your hands up high
And this still the hardest shit you've heard from LA this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss y'all
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard
I'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call
Ghostbusters 'cause you busters are Casper when I go off
I show up, to show out and show off
And if you are, then wreck your car
And walk up to my crime scene
I remember bein' 17, wishin' someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back
Is when they rewind me
Backin' down bargains, backin' down bitches
We gon' flip her
Once she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
'Cause ignorance is bliss
And Willie B, I'm a fool on your beats
I bleed out the speaker
September 22nd, 2009
Kendrick Lamar
To... to...
Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you
I stare at the ceiling and think about you
Curiosity killing me, thinking of when I'ma meet you
Why you love people that love people that do right?
Is it rocket science to you or is it just your type?
Or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
Or maybe a person that I'll never meet 'cause of you
And I swear I'd blow your brains out if you pay me a visit
But that's not realistic, 'cause you'll never rot
But I'ma still send this letter off
P.O. Box, and when you get it....
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal
Scared of you but I will fight you
Should be ashamed of the moves you make
The pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break
Everyday you remind me that you're always there
'Cause every time I come around someone's getting shot down
Then the Lord talk back, "I can't help you, boy!"
That's fucked up, my life's fucked, was cursed before birth
And what's fucked up, I gotta live my life with the hurt
Dwelling upon the masses
Snatchin' bodies
Probably, on my notepad as I write
Why the fuck you wanna take my life?
So when I write on this paper
It's real talk
So...
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal
Let me start off this letter saying I don't like you too
And the reason we haven't met because I've been busy doing whatever since grade school
I've watched your every move
You slipped up a few times, I gave you a pass
Everybody wanna know why I act this way
Let's just say... I had a bad day
Matter fact, everyday
I was born to be a killjoy, I'm an old brat
Conceived by Adam and Eve, so who you mad at?
Not me, see me? I'm just doing my job
And you ducking me? Is mos def an odd
So why send this letter as if I never knew you?
I rather knock on your door and just hand it to you
It's everywhere
The streets, the corners, the coroners, the morgues, the cemeteries, hospitals
Heard about it when I was little
Tomorrow's not promised, 'cause any day can be knocking at your front door
War, genocide, homicide, suicide all coincide
Make it, don't take it
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal
The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing
Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I'm just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing, real talk, and
This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, ya know?)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like "hol' up"
"Where you from?" I don't bang
"Where you stay?" Westside, that's a Piru gang to be exact
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn't wet
Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said, "fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but
This is why they fuck with me (I told you, nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I'm just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I've been through it, now that's cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know?
This is why they fuck with me (haha)
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
But I'mma leave you with this
An O.G. once told me
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I'm gone
Ladies and gentlemen! My man, Kendrick Lamar!
Livin' in America
Thuggin' in the trap
Livin' in a groove
Watchin' TV
Dedicated to the homies in the pen', hit me!
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yay yay
As I look around me
But an enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
(And I love myself)
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy think they high
Uh, one day at a time, sun gon' shine
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, huh
(I love myself)
Uh, when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine
When they say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line full of fiend
(These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation)
Ah man
(I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis)
Uh, dreams of reality's peace
Sky could fall down, the wind could cry now
(I love myself)
Huh, when you lookin' at me, uh, tell me what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, sun gon' shine, everybody, hit me!
(Walk my bare feet, walk my bare feet)
(Down, down valley deep, down, down valley deep)
Oh man, hey check this out, this a real Compton thing goin' on right now, ya feel what I'm talkin' bout? Ya dig that? Sometimes I just get a little bit beside myself, you know what I'm talkin' bout? This here's the return of Enoch, and we gonna do it to you like this, here we go: one, two, three, hit me!
And I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, sun gon' shine)
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
War last night
I've been dealing with depression, duckin' every other blessin'
I could never see the message, I could--
I could never take the lead, never bob and weave
Negative letting them annihilate me
Evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my--
Money in the ceiling lay my body in the street
Glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
I lost my head
Ah man, ay, ay homie, I told you it's a straight up Compton thing, ya dig what I'm talkin' bout? And this here is dedicated to the homies. Y'all feel what I'm saying? And sometimes I just get beside myself. The return of the Enoch is back, you hear what I'm talkin' bout?
Uh, I've been lookin' for you my whole life, appetite
For this feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Something's got me losing my mind
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was 17 with the .38 Special
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
I could be your advocate
I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is
I could preach for you with the mighty tongue
I'm the one, how can I, overcome
Negative energy while I give infinitely and survive?!
These streets is Jurassic, cowards get asthematic
Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere
That's the ghetto bird. Pull up on the curve
"Wassup homie!", smoke a nigga then dip
Strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This the Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry low low, with four zones of weed
No sticks, no seeds
Prestigious when I pulsate the 50 states
My need for speak can corral the largest crowds
Mosh pit, with a big dick screamin' "Bitches ain't shit!"
She gobble gobble for hours, I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, devour hardest Emcees, softer than clam chowder
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein
I'm Corrupted
I'm Corrupted
Verbally useless
Catch you, hang you, from any nooses
Young and I'm ruthless
21 with 21 guns, shot and saluted for Pac
Bitch you's a bitch in disguise, and bitches get ten
Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal Injection
In the regal higher than church steeples
I'm a pterodactyl tearin ya squad like pardon
Me and Terrace Martin enacting Martin
Cannibal coexisting with the coldest, that mean I'm the sickest
And Thera-flu won't do, whenever I'm kicking the wickedness
I'm Corrupted
I'm Corrupted
I'm from C-O-M-P-T-O any nigga can get it
The lil homie strapped and he with it
Blunt longer than Rosecrans
I grab the devil then slow dance
Practice trigonometry
Practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches
West Coast with a big scope kill all yal
It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT
Quick to tell a bitch jump on my dick A-S-A-P
Complete havoc composer, disorder: rhyme addict
Slaughter houses full of Joeys, Joells, and Royces for ya
Live from the area code of 310
Laughing all the way to the bank with 3 elmos
Three 64's, 1 bottle of goose
I'm the truth
You can put ya hand on the bible and shoot
I'm Corrupted
I sit on the studio couch
Ask myself what the fuck am I thinking about
A Dr. Dre record, imagine, I drift off 600 seconds
K. Dot had turned Curious George
You know, off the hardship is what I'm curious for
Like what if Pac had never looked left to holla at broads
Before he turned right to get them shots through the door
They say Suge did it, but he was in emergency clinic
So he'd risk his own life, to get someone else killed
But in the process, get injured, it don't make sense
It's like the Da Vinci Code, trying the solve the crime of these rap souls
Never went to L.A., would it make a difference in them bullet-holes
Would it make my flow flow more persistent
Would it raise up the bar of competition, who knows
Who told Nastradamus baby momma was fucking with HOV
Would the battle be less interesting, if it wasn't personal
If Jay wasn't intimate, there'd probably be less people listening
People thinking its a publicity stunt
What if he partnered with Jay and still didn't blow
Hip-hop would really be fucked
Something like Milli Vanilli
Nothing different, quite similar
Filling up my mind capacity
Thinking about Martin Luther, on the balcony
What if the shooter-
Better yet, what if Malcolm on the side
Killed two birds with one stone, both would've died
Now lets rewind
Before we go
Can you imagine?
Picture years, with your mom
Can you imagine?
Hang her picture in the sky
Can you imagine?
Call emergency I've been dreamin' all my life
Imagine if Tookie was a Blood, Look, no disrespect
Dominating the population of-
Matter fact, imagine if we didn't really start this gangster shit
Y'all wouldn't have nothin' to spit
No drive bys, no flags stickin' out pockets
No NWA dudes, just rappin like Cre Cru
Feet no paralyzed, would he be alive
No match, no cars in that driveway
On this L.A. strip, would these rap n*ggas use his name
Nah, what if rap niggas never had rap would they try to fall back on this drug game
Now these rappers getting caught with the cocaine
Not to smoke, but to slang
Imagine that people not knowing these rap niggas insane
Just think about it
Imagine life without death would you even feel alive
Your people that passed, what if they never died
The street living what if the crack epidemic
Never reached the projects and destroyed our buildings
Turned most of us to killers, innocent victims
Imagine if heroine didn't affect our system
They say drug money funding the labels today
What about the drug money that's funding the C.I.A
Imagine if they really tried to fix these streets
Would they start in the hood, or executive suites
Where the real criminals meet, and principals beef with me
You could possibly live without heat
Imagine if Al Gore, had won that election
Would the Twin Tower buildings still stand erected
Imagine the penal system without witness protection
Would there be these many cowards on the stand telling
I don't know, I'm just speaking my mind
Lost in my own soul, Just press rewind and imagine
(Training day, training day)
See, I'm the man, tell 'em roger that
I got bitches shattering glasses trying to holla back
My pockets fat, if not they getting there
That's VIP, nigga, you'll never get in there
See, I inspire conversation with dollar signs
You either talking money or just remain the mime
That mean great brain
I swear to God every time I pop off that I pop a vein
And you ain't getting it 'til you get in that jew love
I'm talking Seinfeld, Ben Stiller, Wall Street, bank tellers
You'll see the light saber dropping jewels, Marc Jacobs
You know
This is for my mothafucking Compton babies
And all the wild blocks that drove us crazy
Dominguez Hospital born
Niggas dying fast no life insurance
Bullets got no names on it so if a girl get hit the response of it was like our bad
Say hello to the hip hop's Norman Bates
I ain't even burn 'em yet
Well done when the second first come
I have an acquired taste
I will eat all day
I'm sittin' down my legs  are crossed like i had (?) shoes
I tell dude, i ain't worried about these rap dudes
They're not in my league, the West coast is me
I put it on Hov like I had (Calvin Jeans)?
I'm nightmare on Elm Street, come right through your dreams and
Say hello to the team, ain't ya?
The world is anxious for my LP
Get pop grades, i get an A-plus, you get a D
What money got to do with it
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, shit
Life to me, like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Oh now, slow down
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five foot something, God bless the kid
Took his homie to the show and this is what they said
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Well, that's me at these awards"
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy
She said...
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Oh now, slow down
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service
My day one motherfucking fans in this building, one time. As I look around-this the shit. I ain't been this intimate in a long time. We might be up here all motherfucking night, I got something. I ain't seen y'all in a minute, real shit. You know I mean it when I say, I been around the world and shit. A whole sea of people. But nothing like coming right here in front of this small group. The people that's been with me since day one. Kendrick Lamar EP. Kendrick Lamar OD. Section-mothefucking-.80. Real shit. This is cool right here goddamn, this is really cool right now. This about real shit, listen up. To Pimp a Butterfly. People said a lot about this album. That'd said album of the year, that' said album of this generation and all that shit. That's cool, but also real shit making this motherfucking album was therapy. Not only for you, but for me, You know what I'm saying? Because within six months of good kid, m.A.A.d city dropping, the life of what I knew, when I knew what it was, thinking I knew, that completely changed within six months. And uh, you going through the motional of the world telling you that you're great. And you trying to make yourself believe that shit, but it's hard because you're institutionalized from where you come from. Still trying to move around and stay the way I like I do. I'm a low-key nigga. And I ain't scared of the world. Me personally, I can't run around with a hundred niggas like I usually do. I don't need to, I don't want to. And that's just been me since day one. So trying to grasp the idea of them telling you who you should run with, it can't cut it. Because like I said on the Kendrick Lamar EP, "I need to be me goddamnit". I think this shit can live forever, but looking at y'all faces y'all just. I got some of the most loyal. dedicated motherfucking fans in the world (?). (?) I could talk all day (?). To Pimp a Butterfly. Y'all allowed this motherfucking album has soared all the way to the top with no motherfucking commercial success. Y'all allowed it to be top-tier without a constant radio single and shit. So that proves to you right there, music is not something you can motherfucking market all the time. This shit belong to you and you only, you know what I'm saying? Some shit that y’all can feel whether you insecure, whether you vulnerable, whether you mad, happy, angry, sad. You pop this motherfucking tape in, you pop your favorite music in, and you love and you live that shit. And you allow artists like me myself to come back to these group of people and perform the shit that I want to perform, you dig what I'm saying? This may be the first and last time I perform To Pimp a Butterfly on this run. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York be one of them cities that I come back to to do this shit. So with that being said, we gon' rock this shit until the casket drop or until, until it all falls down. Let's go
Greetings people
You're now rockin' with the best
Hub City's threat
Minor of the year
K.Dot
I know the hood's been waitin', right
I'mma stop being stingy
I'mma share with y'all
Whoever thought young Kendrick would spit so ignorant
Make street disciples go and get a membership
Streets revival like Creflo Dollar hustlin' on the strip
This is church
Y'all rhymes sloppy, I rhyme properly
I jam pack Monopoly dollars by puttin' 100% in every verse
Add 10% more and what to you get
A skinny nigga manipulatin' the innocent
Mind militant, nigga don't try it
Try to hold the peace, for I promote violence
Y'all don't rap
Y'all make a lotta noise like sirens
So I'm here to shut shit down
Make over your town
I'm not Diddy, but still a bad boy
Where no man has stepped, no man has repped
No man can withstand all the nights I've slept
Fuckin' with me, you just might lose your breath
I'll take you to them pearly gates
Them golden streets
Do you believe
It's Kendrick the God
Weezy Up, K.Dot
The homie K.Dot, he crazy too
I cosign this, shout out to my homie Jay Rock too, he's my nigga too
Your nigga? Shit
I co-sign it
This is a world premiere!
This is a world premiere!
I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
Satan wanna put me in a bow tie
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
I love my... self
(One day at a time, sun gonna shine)
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (crazy!)
What you gonna do? (what you gonna do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving (keep moving)
Or let the paranoia haunt you (haunt you)?
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
I love my... self
(One day at a time, sun gonna shine)
They wanna say it's a war outside and a bomb in the street
And a gun in the hood, and a mob of police
And a rock on the corner, and a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean, and a model on the scene yup
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs)
I love myself
(But it can do what it want whenever it want, I don't mind)
I love myself
(He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide)
I love my... self
(One day at a time, sun gonna shine)
Walk my bare feet (walk my bare feet)
My heart undone (my heart undone)(I love myself)
The world is a ghetto with big guns and picket signs
(I love myself)
He said I gotta get up, life is more than suicide
(I love my... self)
One day at a time, sun gonna shine
(Hold up)
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it till I get it right
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body in the street
Keep my money in the ceiling, let my mama know I'm free
Give my story to the children and a lesson they can read
And the glory to the feeling of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"
I lost my head
Oh, woes keep me, it's a jungle inside
Uh, Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick have a dream
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I feel amazin', damn, I'm in the Matrix
My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winners, screamin'—
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum and posin'
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches: wifey, girlfriend and mistress
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or, nigga, it's go time
I roll in dough with a good grind
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you goin' marry mines."
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! No way
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! Okay
I'm never livin' life confined
As I feel you even if I'm blind
I can tell you who, what, when, where
How to sell your game right on time
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! Go play
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! I look like OJ
She pussy poppin' and I got options like an audible, I be
All my life I want money and power
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Goddamn I got bitches, damn I got bitches
Damn I got bitches, wifey, girlfriend and mistress
Respect my mind or die from lead showers
Let it run, Ali
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
What's behind the other door, oh
No more silence, don't kill this thing we got called love
Just searching for the perfect shot
When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
My conscious only knew whats half tight
At 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga
This is a dog's fight, my nigga
The soundtrack to life, my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his momma called him that
He watched House Party, and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packs
Pump, fake, jumpshot, ball hit the back
Board dreams of being pointguard was off limits jack
That's because that's these Compton streets was built not to win
Pardon me though, I'm searching for answers
The good kid from the ugly city, that's mad that he's handsome
Where is the love?
When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look away
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red Range
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
Then give me some land, or maybe I'll land a, G5
Clearport,say hello to the man
Give me awards, grammies, and let the crowd applaud
My name 'til they strain the veins in they vocal cords
With that being said, give me Tiger sports endorsements
Give me billboards, whatever that people will kill for
Manahattan and 40/40, no 40's but rose poured
Give me vanity, give me Kurt Cobain sanity
Give me a city where Channel 7 newscasters cameras be
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the charts
And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar, this is me
When love comes calling, don't love back
When love comes calling, don't look away
When love comes calling, don't look away
I'm still lost in my own zone in the living room
Like I'm dead to the world playing Donny Hathaway
Each sip bring me closer to my doom
Sun shining bright through the crack in the blind
Thinking to myself this morning what happened to time
It's passing away, the world decides, it ain't what it used to be
Everything I love don't mean what it used to mean
For example spitting a 16
No thrills, feeling numb like i'm of Thorazine
It used to be nicotine, I was addicted to this rap thing
Enough drowning in my sorrow, never put off tomorrow
What you can do today, that's my new motto
With that said, I roll out the bed
Hit the showers, it's time to get this bread, now make dollars
I woke up in the morning, washed my body, put some clothes on it
After that, put on my heat like Alonzo Mourning
Cause everybody got a gun, it's like they're copy cats
I'd be out of style like Adidas and fat laces
Starter Jackets and dookie ropes or whatever the late 80's had favored
I'm one of the best of my Homo Sapiens
One of the best of God's creations
He shows favoritism everytime you hear the record on radio stations
I know you mad, you ain't gotta say much, I can feel you hating
Serving mc's like waitress, Andre Agassi, multitalented
Half of these niggas ain't talking 'bout nothing, yakity, yakity
Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping them rapidly
Actually, Kurt, Co-Bain
Ten years in my career, pray to God that I don't blow up my brains, Lord, I'm here
They call me Subway sandwich the way i give them cold cuts
Cut from a different cloth, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans;
They cost so much
Anything that's custom, best believe I'mma get it
Getting tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on the Compton premises without your weap-on on your hip
No matter the crime rate I still remain content
Moving at my own pace, cause if it don't make dollars
Then it really don't make sense, and if you can't comprehend
I holler like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence
I woke up this morning, counting my cash
Girls calling me now, straight throwing the ass
I threw on my T, I grabbed my bitch
Laced up my chucks, rock sharp as a piece
They used to call me a creature, but now I'm a beast
With my voice on the beat, I'm the voice of the streets
From my head to the feet, I'm bad to the bone
Nigga, I won't stop, 'till I'm add to the throne
Call me Pharrell, boy, I keep me them Clipse
Trapped in the hood, far from Giligans Island
Nigga, I'm more iller, call me a hospital
You got the hiccups, I got this fluent as shit nigga
I spit a bar, straight ruin your shit nigga
Known as a mack, I can influence your bitch
I'm the reason these niggas be handcuffin' them quick
I'm the reason these bitch niggas be playa hating on us
See them in the streets, these niggas don't be saying nothing
But keep on talking, you ain't ready for beef
Jay Rock down to bust a nigga head in the streets
Wrong place, wrong time, that's how you get clapped nigga
Raised in the projects, money my object
They standing in my way, like a frog I dissect them
You'll get shot walking through my section
Now you a verse all in my session, they say life is a school
Shit naw, check my ghetto report card, straight A student in every class up in the Gardens
Money over bitches, nigga i'm heartless
Money over bitch niggas, rich is my target
(target) - x4
Yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
A month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges brought up
I shook my head, turned around then found a $100
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why You keep blessing me
I don't know why I don't know why I don't know why
Yesterday I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
I stormed out then seen a black Honda Accord
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
Closed my eyes then asked myself how I was feeling
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willing
See my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this is meant for
Me to give them a $100 then trash my pistol
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
Now I know why You keep blessing me
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
Lord help me
I know this weed is burning
And I'm on drink number two
Cold, cold world
Sometimes I think You can help me
But this bus here is temporary
So I'm talking to You
This sick world will drive a sane man crazy
Birds dropping out the sky, daughters having their fathers' babies
And this the news I hear
When my god kids, nieces, and nephews turn a year
I wonder, will it get better
A little cheddar, when it get better
But the rest of that's cash
Make last year's Christmas gift you, my bad
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
If I just keep the faith
I know You'll be right there
Sometimes it may not seem that You are there
But You're there
You're everywhere
And I thank You for
Protecting me in these streets
From danger seen and unseen
I never know
What happened the night
I wasn't there
Something told me leave so I left
Three got shot after the club
All listening to that small voice
Oh you saved my life
Real rap, I knock rhymes right off of your skull cap
You can't see me when I step into the booth
Your wish list, K.Dot, yeah I'm the truth
Stuntin, you'd better get your broom
Cause I'm flying with witches and we're going to the moon
With this album, debut at that
I'm so fly I might float with the bats
Y'all know the most
Biggie and Pac, they behind me as my ghosts
Cause you think they write for me when I step into the drop
This the freestyle, trick or treat
Pumpkins, smacking them across they head
And I'm pokin' eyeballs out on the web instead
He gonna gonna keep going
Baby, sex tape killed me
Ye, ye, I'm so fly, right now I'm so high
Matter of fact oh we talking about the hurricane
I'm talking about New York, I pray for y'all, know what I mean
Coming straight from Compton, I thought y'all know
I ain't gonna look at the cards yet, cause I'm 'bout to flow
We gonna keep going, off the top of the dome
Mavs, y'all gonna go home
Teach y'all to come back to my city
Shrink you, G
Five times, four times, that's the repeat
Obama, we ain't gonna talk about Ritt Momney
Because he's whack, fugazi, fugazi
I don't need to talk about the flow that I'm in
If you gonna vote, vote for Obama
He's gonna win, fo sho
Off the top, we just gonna keep on flowing
We gonna get back to this little punk, he's crap
Mitt Romney, show 'em how to rap
Matter fact, this freestyle is just dedicated to him
You're homeboys right now with Slim
Your chances, you're not gonna win
You need to go back to where you came from, boy
It's the ruler of the game
What's up
Two shot the diligence
I slide on my hater like skrrt (woah, woah, woah)
I’m killing this shit don’t get murked (woah, woah, woah)
No more reminiscing on who shot, we finish it
Blade runner, walking on thin ice, admit it is
Hot feet running, I been nice, I’m it, legit
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumping "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only 17
She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
That's ironic
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Remember the sergeant let her slide, said if he seen
A warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind
She made it where nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour
She suddenly realized, she'll never escape the allure
Of a black man, white man, needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners' redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
10 months before she was 10 he moved in
And that's when he touched her
This mothafucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind
She made it where nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder
Left for dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song
My little sister 11, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard, oh
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
I can tell you what it is, I can tell you what it isn't
Fuck a stage name, that's the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify within this business
I'm just a good kid from Compton that want to rap
But this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to win
I'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends
So just to get a dollar, will I sell my soul?
They say anything worth having is worth the wait
There's no time like now, I can cut my patience short
Or give 'em some more gowns, I don't even want the crown
I just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when I get it
You won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own business?
A rich nigga buy anything you sell him
A broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
Well I'm a broke nigga, but still I wouldn't listen to you
Even if your hand was on a Bible quote, nigga, pfttuh
See I was brought up different
It don't concern you if you wasn't born in it
I swear we got to fast-forward, before time flies by
My new saying for '0-10 is, why lie?
This is I nigga, look into my eye
Nigga, I am Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, pfttuh
And that used to be a hell of a task
Now I'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass
My character like it don't carry a confidence
That can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina with no cash
I'm bout to cash in my thoughts
Give you a compass, then tell you get lost
What I'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom
Once the Eves come, they quick to stare at him
Hoping I don't take their bitch, but I'm on some other shit
When I'm done, I'm tryna run the government
These are big dreams, transition from a rapper to a human being
You can't 'school' a dean
All cause they all a facade, my God
All because who I are, Lamar
But my first name, it gotta be Kendrick... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick... Lamar
I changed the name cause I was tired of being like y'all
Now finally I'm ready to tell the world who I are, now let's go
But we can't go... backwards
Vai se foder, filho da puta, você é um arrombado
Eu não sei porque tenta ser grande, mano, você não é merda nenhuma
Eu não deveria estar fodendo contigo de qualquer forma
Eu preciso de um jogador, um chefão
Seus parceiros sabem, todo mundo sabe
Vai se foder, mano, não me ligue mais
Você não vai saber, você vai perder uma boa mulher
Este pau não está de graça
Você está olhando para mim como se não tivesse um recibo
Como se eu nunca tivesse bancado as despesas
Comendo suas sobras e sua carne crua
Este pau não está de graça

Every member of rap's Mount Rushmore dropped new albums in 2013—Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem—but it was another MC altogether who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the latest—and possibly greatest—rapper to come straight outta Compton.
It turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his "little bro"—a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.
So today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. "It all happened when I was overseas," he says. "I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed."
It's been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds—one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever—and since then his legend has spread fast.
It actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album—about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing "that crazy-ass girl Sherane"—is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest—the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house—and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast—Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness—but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:
If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song "Control"—a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself "the king of New York," which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.
"Control" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.
Kendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it "back to the set" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. "It can be complicated and confusing," Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. "From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous—I still live in this world." And when someone back home needs something, "I still gotta get that phone call."
It's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.
A bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: "When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow." Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: "Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy."
On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over "Control" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on "Control," and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake's VMA performance of "Hold On, We're Going Home," Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. "You watch," he joked, "I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!"
I got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out—"Control" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. "Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis," Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, "No—peer. If anything. We all peers."
"I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now—it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette."
The visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. "It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin'," he explains. "I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle."
A few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, "Aw, man, I can't go to no club."
Kendrick spoke up.
"We have to go."
"Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go."
"You know me," Kendrick explained. "I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!"
"Well," Tiffith told me, "we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand."
The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati—Jay, Bey—mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the "King of New York" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. "It was all love at that party," he told me on the private jet.
After we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: "We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas."
By the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for "Swimming Pools (Drank)," a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency—Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK—a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.
It's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. "I don't know," he says. "It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be."
At one point on good kid Kendrick raps, "I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.
Only go backwards, lately
Feels like we only go backwards darling
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Pump my fist like I'm supposed to, I showed you
My vision of the unsocial, it's so cool
I refuse to play the victim, my religion is to move ya
Can't harm me out of my own skin, government need assistance
Than tellin' you that I won't bend, break or fake partition
I can't, this is my life design, this is me taking mine's
This is what I live for, this is me takin' yours
This is more than C4, this is what happens when
We ready to build and destroy, I hope that you enjoy
It feels like I only go backwards, lately
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
I live my life a rebel, a vigilante, devils try to get at me
Pedal through this underworld, undertakers won't catch me
System ain't no system for justice if you would ask me
I'll tell you everything is corrupted, don't you walk past me
With the condescended look I can tell you're pretendin'
Like you my friends and you just a henchman, I feel relentless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut through it
Or cut you with it, I'm cut from a cloth that bred a nuisance
Trespass on your property I am properly aimin' to go against ya democracy
The victory of fight is all in my eyes
The night is young and I can see your demise, I'm waitin' for it
You can’t ignore it, you live dormant, I die enormous
Big as the lies you tell I can tell you feel defeated
It feels like I only go backwards, lately
Every part of me says go ahead
Feels like we only go backwards darling
I got a bone to pick
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Screamin', "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

I'm in a Lamborghini with a Brazilian woman (oh yeah?)
Suck my dick till she numb it (god damn)
You fly like a plane
But I'm more like a comet
Soaring over the atmosphere
I can hear the aliens cheer (ha)
Victory is sweet my dear (mm-hmm)
Here's the technique my dear (mm-hmm)
And maybe you can duplicate me
It's weird how y'all never can progress within the process
Of making residuals
I guess that you ain't I yet
Watch y'all bear arms like women rub on my triceps duddy
Y'all is funny to me
You thought I came by myself nope
It's the root of all evil, but the need of all people
Yours is frail
I weigh mines on Brannon Scales

More fifties more hundreds
Astronauts hover throughout the atmosphere, that the ghetto burb
Pull up on the curb (what's up homie!), smoke a nigga then dip
It's the immaculate, verbal assassin, strangle your perfect etiquette to an accent
This is Jesus of Nazareth
Spittin' gold policies to a world unknown
In a cherry Low-Low with four zones of weed, no sticks no seeds
Prestigious when I post safe through fifty states, beneath the speed
Can corral the largest crowds, mosh pit with a big dick
Screaming bitches ain't shit, she gobble gobble for hours I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, devour, hardest Emcees softer than Clam chowder
No challengers can compete, they're childish and weak, detrimental
Hazardous hazard to instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein
I'm kurupted!
Gimme a hundred G's for every Emcee I drop to their knees
Verbically useless, oh you got the Juice? I'll squeeze you juiceless
Been the truth since, Snoop and the pound was fuckin' over ruthless
Bullets to their midsection, Mr. Lethal injection in a regal higher than church steeples, I swear to god
Count your lyrics in a jar, I'mma pterodactyl tearin' ya squad, like pardon me in Terrance Martin in Aston Martin
Cannibal co-existing with the coldest, that means I'm the sickest, and Theraflu won't do
Whenever I'm kicking the wickedness, explosive, syntagmatic, smokin' like the barrel of this tech aimin' at ya' neck
I'm kurupted!
(Look homie) I'm from C-O-MP-TO-aNy nigga can get it, the little homie strapped and he with it
At the Avalanche swap-meet (what's up fool!)
Blunt longer than Rosecrans, I'll grab the devil then slow dance
Practice trigonometry, practice my aim on rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches, you are counterfeit
Worthless beats and verses surfaced. West Coast with a big scope kill all Y'all It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT

See a lot of y'all get real disrespectful, real comfortable, not recognizin' ya' legends
West Coast legends, Young Gotti
I black out like Howard University when I verbally turn into Hercules hurtin' these Emcees early and urgently urkin' my nerves searching for certain certified nouns and verbs on the verge of vigorous victory. Kurupted
Check, check, check, check, check
It go...
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
To the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
Maybe this Earth is ain't a good place to be
How far is heaven? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer
What I'm doing, I'm saying that I'm human, now people just
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
It go one (one), two (two), three (three)
Two in the front, one in the back seat (seat), seat (seat), seat (seat), seat (seat)
But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature?
I don't know, I look for the answers later
"Make a right, there they go!"
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it
I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wilding, a young'n with lack of guidance
That's hundreds of us with problems
Mo' money, mo' drugs and violence
That's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life
But regardless I'ma
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause I never know
When a bullet might hit me and I die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live my life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what I is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
Yeah, life can please you, but death can tease you
On the day Niko had that seizure
I lost one of my biggest believers, aww!
Close deaths make you think about your life
Like if I had that same chance twice, what would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more, do more
But tease her 'bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording
Swear, I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in heaven, saying, "They at it again"
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord, what kind of life is this?
"Momma, I just wanna sing"
You gotta risk everything"
So I'm smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
I love money, I love bitches for the lack of better words
Ain't got no time, ain't got no feelings for the lack of better words
The music loud, can't hear it ringing for the lack of better words
You got nothing left to offer but a lack of better words
Get nothing else from me but a lack of better words
Feeling cheap to be your woman for the lack of better words
But I say my ego gotta yeet for the lack of better words
I can't love you, I love these streets for the lack of better words
But if it's true, you would trust me for better or for worse
I'm selfish, I can't help it, for the lack of better words
You gon' be like this forever for the lack of better words
You gon' get your shit together, no, no you never learn
You cannot do better for the lack of better words
Never can let you forget it any time you on my nerves
Na, na, na, all you do, make excuse
Na, na, na, all you do, is make excuse
(Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy)
I wish this nigga (uh!)
I wish a nigga would
I wish this nigga (yeah!)
I wish your mhm-mhm-mhh
I wish this nigga (uh!)
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga (yeah!)
Stuck in a rock and a hard place [inaudible]
Yeah, woah
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official
Game dropped Documentary and made plenty enemies
It was a classic album, but prior to that
Guerilla Black debuted and put the city on wax
But that wasn't my M.O., I just thought he was dope
Can't understand why Game would say his name in that manner
Many years went by, still no legitimate answer
Anyway, I put out a mixtape in 12th grade
Hub City threat, minor of the year, DJ Dave
Put it out to the people, the people said I was stupid
With the flow, went to the barbershop to show off my skills
Mike and Himey and some other cat said I was real
Himey was Games barber, the other cat made a statement
Said he'd play it for him, hoping that I'd get my big break
But never got a response.. anyway
This nigga named Pop Gates came to my school with a camera
I freestyled on his DVD for a minute then after
It hit the streets, I was known as K. Dot from Compton
Man Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin'
Until I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet
Me at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour
Told me come back tomorrow, but I came back in a hour
Jay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape
Was skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed
Did our first collaboration on the Nephew track
We started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper
Before Sidekicks became a modern day phone
Same time our buzz was generated from G Malone
He had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it
Said that Sony had gave him an unbelievable budget
Now that's a smart nigga, I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life
But not knowing how to market it right
Turned on the radio
Only cat new from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop
And by then this nigga' buzz was tremendous
In the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft
But all we had was the instrumental and the hook
But when
Gave it to Julio, just to get his opinion
Next thing you know, the record was
Spinning
That was a good look, it set the coast on fire
Niggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot
Then these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station
Ask why they record ain't playin', what you niggas complaining, about?
Shit was funny to us tho
Niggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo
In the midst of the single poppin' and niggas tryna seek and destroy
I had a situation with Def Jam, premature
I was glad Jay-Z gave me respect
Far as radio play, obvious, he got a lot
Beefing’ with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it
Which in my opinion, I didn’t think the shit was impo’tant
But that’s a whole ‘nother story, we hit the lab with Game
And a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy
Did the cypher freestyle and everybody’s like, "Wow"
These Top Dawg niggas ‘bout to make noise"
Surely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that
But right after that, we didn’t see him no more
G Malone came with a smash hit with Akon
Mistah FAB battled Royce Nickel with napalm
Then everybody start to scream out the new West
And claim that West Coast legends don’t want to see him at best
I think that’s just an excuse, because their music ain't tight
Tell ‘em that Ab-soul said it, they can quote him twice
Then Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin’ the internet
But he been a threat since Deathrow, then Roccett came about
It finally started to look like the West was makin’ moves
Western Union had the whole block boomin’ because of Snoop
Matter fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite about the group
Then ?Problem? took off, another Compton native
We both Compton niggas, but Compton still ain't made it
By this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves
We almost got into some major beef over Lil’ Wayne
Theres certain things that the streets only should know about
Shout out to Nipsey
That’s when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me
Because they didn’t see my views, grab the hottest album out and re-do it
That’s a goddamn power move stupid
You foolish, don’t know shit about this war shit
Theres mo’ shit to wanting to be the king of the coast shit
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
We the last real niggas alive, that’s official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He’s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
So two weeks ago I finally run into the nigga I gave my mixtape too
And said he was partners with Game
He said he didn’t like it
But the niggas like
“See, see, look at you, look at you now, I tried to tell him you was tight”
Nigga probably never even gave it to him and shit
Everybody, just clap your hands if you're real
Middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
I just wanna be me
No disrespect, but motherfuck you
My education stopped at a high school degree
But I can outsmart any high IQ
Cold, my style making my nose run
Oh, I stare at the mirror then realize, that real lies within me
Some say I'm crazy cause I think like I need a shrink
Ask too many questions about the stars and Earth shit
Rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
So if I'm not clubbing, don't think I'm on some jerk shit
But I'd just rather 2-step, like my first steps
Yes
Just let me be me
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
And skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
Still face, play me short like an oompa loompa
Won't you lighten up like Michael did?
I grew up with killas man, people who killed men
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
Live my life through some film, man
I ain't acting out shit, I be packing out shows
Cause they know that they don't know Kendrick fo' sho
And oh
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
Almost lost my life to the industry
These label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
Have you with professional killas, chasing hits
Making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
My Mama said, "Boy, that don't sound like you."
I said, "This is the sound, though."
My only excuse
And kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
And you can underrate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in God's dirt, a diamond in winter
Watch the Simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
To make sure that you feel me
Just let me be me
That's the only way I know
That's the only way I know how to hold it down
That's, that's the only way I know how to hold it down
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar. what are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, is this really you?
Is this who you are? What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
I think that I finally reached the pinnacle
Of finding myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I used to want to be the messiah of Rap
Infatuated with becoming a relevant star
That I never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say that it can damage me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a cool cocaine connect
Cooking in a laboratory, hoping I can tell a story
That the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I'm misunderstood
So I gotta get my point across like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
Or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
And Dave said he proud of my newfound honesty
And all I could say is, "Will the radio care?"
Yeah, or should I say no?
Or should I just stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my hip-hop when I was 16 years old
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
But I'm not worried
My talent should take me places I've never been
The world should turn as soon as my records spin
I wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
The capital punishment, the loud police sirens
Too focused, one word, righteous
And this is Kendrick Lamar, and soon ya'll know Cloud 9, ya'll
That means I wanna be the highest
Too focused, one word, righteous
Too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Uh
Yeah
Kendrick Lamar
Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I'm  a thinker not a drinker but still I Hennessey drag;
Alcohol numbs the pain like where Novacane stabs
In your arteries, pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on em
Colours corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted Crips and Pirus cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Quran can save;
Welcome, don't be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights;
Stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five?
I'm twenty-two, at twenty I knew I was against the odds;
This kid named Jonathan was monitoring
His momma and sister, his older cousin, he honoured him;
To Johnny, he might've been
A modern day rider then
He walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a MAC-11 now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, what's his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one
Crip crazy, rocking matching T-shirts that says "The hood made me"
No love, just spread slugs, that's the policy, the leader and the prodigy;
Now shorty doo-wop, holding a oowop, hanging with rah-rahs
With blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades and licks
Going on missions with lunatics, a ninth-grade menace
Thugging for six months, smoking like six blunts an hour;
The power of banging, he was walking from...(gunshots)
Little Johnny
I think you'll find, sir, that there will come a time
To think for themselves as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
And this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
And then at that point you will have a situation
Where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
And this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
And this type of thinking also will bring an end to the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people)
And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
It's something that the black man has to bring an end to
Wow
I think I must have forgot or something
Like I ain't hot or something
Like I don't make your girl take off her top or something
I'm like
Hahahaha
LMAO
Laugh at the haters in here
I'll be her favorite in years
She wanna play play
But, what more can I say say?
Jump in the coup and I'm gone
I smell like money, I don't need no cologne
I just need me a freak
That can jump on the bone
Like an X-Ray technician
My rectangular prism
Says money sex then drugs
Like playing blackjack
Picture this kodak
Moment forever
K.Dot that dude
She sucked my dick and got frostbite
I got a pocket full of checks
With a crazy two-step
And diamonds on my neck
Ziploc fresh
Hoes wanna play play
Bottle of goose and I'm gone
Watching her get loose
The shit that we on
Is the ultimate high
Double XL flow
That's the ultimate vibe
Like I never could pass
A sobriety test
I'm in the club I can manage
Make my view panoramic
I'm off of this planet
They don't say K.Dot is here
They say his spaceship has landed
And your access has been granted
Like a kitchen floor
I ride in the carpool because I got two whores
Like Aaliyah alone
DJ Heat, what up?
Hello, hit every lying clip with a Eggo
Who gassed you up? Man, I raised the price of the petro
Killing Cali, gang bangers and GTA's
Weed and water, come and swim on a tidal wave
I'm fucked up, psychologically braindead
I once walked into a Blood group, wearing all red
Wonder why nobody's banging on me
Getting mad as fuck, then the police came
I'm from Compton too, shoutout to Game, give me a pair of shoes
Finna skydive off the peak of my career
From the murder cap, you never heard of that, okay
What about now? Clip-clip, pow, man down
It's like this and like that and like this and a
It's like that and like this and like that and a
Never know so ride around strapped and I
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Washed up, bang, bang, you know what's good, bang, bang
Who said Long Beach don't keep it hood?
Five minutes away, say you can die today if you dumbing out
Well let's just say, if you run your trout
You fucking fish get shot in the mouth
And plus your bitch get shot in the mouth
That's ejaculation, you kiss it, then you taste it
I road around with my antennas up like
Television way before the satellite
K Dot mechanisms, learn something
I could tell that you don't know nothing
You dumb fuck, I'm basked up and Jim Carrey myself
You better duck, bless screwed, you'll be eating through a tube
I've been fueled, that's the fucking guy
I've been fueled, that's too fucking fly
So where's my parachute, I'm 'bout to jump from the Hoover Dam
No car cue, I think I landed in the Hoover, damn
They 'bout to shoot
It's like this and like that and like this and a
Never know so ride around strapped and I
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Washed up, bang, bang, you know what's good, bang, bang
I'm an East side savage, black matters bring tragics
Spray maggots, swat flies for the practice
It's a habit, laughing at you bitch ass niggas, get on my level
Heavy metal when I'm rocking in my jeans
Drop your captor for acting like he wanted the drama
Grab the llama, she baddest mama
House disrespectful, blame it on the hood I come from
Catch me walking with some
I'm double hot, I'm walking with heat that's under the sun
You blood pop, you done if you ain't got one
Before you know it, you're close to showing
Down for the count like an accountant
California, what you know about it?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Like Master Pete, I am the streets
Jay Rock
It's like this and like that and like this and a
It's like that and like this and like that and a
Killer Cali niggas don't know how to act and I
Never know so ride around strapped and I
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, bang
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Uh, shoutout to ScHoolboy Q
He uglier than a motherfucker (laughs)
Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with the tire marks
When the relay starts I’m a runaway slave
Ugh, walking on water and running on waves
God MC, oh my God, you gotta see
There’s never no I's in me
Of an Odyssey, I’m a block away
Fire marshal's moving in
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
Got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
I’m so appalled
With the prototype with a godly protocol
I damage ya on camera, in Compton, in Canada
I don’t care where ya are
Just blink twice and I’m there where you are
In an ocean full of sharks bout to come up short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams nigga pay up or blam blam nigga
Had a black Camry, bumpin' Dipset, Killa Cam nigga
I had been around niggas, killas, pimps
You ain’t been around shit but your momma and your bitch
Uncle Bobby got the house raided back in 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen way before I even heard of Mike Vick
Momma in the bathroom poppa at work
Happened on Sunday we shoulda went to Church
Look at my shirt, Polo on it
It’s gon' sell if my logo on it
I fear no opponent
A demon come near and I might throw a spear at the omen
You looking at the 2010 Romans
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in ya face like HD
And I spit like a HK
I’ma shot like a H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Problem and Hootie nigga
Tell the government come shoot me, nigga
And a fist full of money give it to the fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don’t wanna see a B-L-A-C-K
Making some scratch like a hall of fame DJ
Give us some free J’s put us in PJs
Now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
God-Damn, y'all cold
Black man tell me where your God-Damn heart go
Although I’m in the land of milk and honey
Nobody never gave me shit, when I got my first chain
Take it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny tryna talk back and shit
Like he back that shit
Acting like you real or something
Nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
Go pop some pills or something
With your BM in it and your stash box glove
And the medicine a doctor gave a nigga won't help
I’m at the limit where I be amazing myself
I bet I hit it where every rapper get killed, like
Bla bla bla bla where the knife at?
Cut cut cut where your life at?
Your careers over, he’s slumped over
And if I'm off beat know I’m un-sober
That's a new flow
New dough for the new year and I sumo on a rap peer
Not a rapper, I’m a raptor
That's a T-Rex in a V-neck for the rapture
I’m a factor and your facial
I will fracture to a fraction
No one-half and I hate math
Pastor’s like Eddie long, fucking maricon
Took me mighty long to get here
Nigga, Fuck!
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yeah, I know
It's been a minute
Got to know
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Yeah, you need me (Woooh!)
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation, boy
Don't argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors, authors and novel spitters
And it's all for the literature
I promise I'd never leave you, ah yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes
Soon as the flow get nice
The poltergeist that scare emcees
My prototype for every
My share of D's and R.I.P
She know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently, my appetite stay famished
Bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen (Look over your shoulder)
Devote my time and mind it seems
Supposed to shine, remind I'm king
The pro's the con's, the diamond rings
The forward time, but I'ma bring
The soul divine and cross between
What's your's and mine's, the gold, the green
That grabbed Shakur and by the wing
And fly before my vocal scream!
For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc bag full of goodies
You Chris Rock
Hit the pookie and pit stops
When they fuck you over
It's love, I know ya
Don't you know, baby?
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yeah yeah, you need me (Woooh!)
Shhh, look over your shoulder, get me?
Niggas scared to rap with me
Get burned until they anointed me
One of the kings of black history
And yes, I see the game is a little different
Niggas lack simply
And bars and I spit 'em like darts
'Til they puncture your kidney
You trash and it don't matter how much you gon' try to convince me
And you gon' make my gun cock until your hole night away
Yeah, ohh
I'm the Buddha, the Ali Baba, the believerer maker
So pristine, the dice roll from under my sleeve when I shake 'em
So rude, I'm so ice cold but I'm what you need to just wake 'em
While 'em crowns and medals on the wall waitin' for me to just take 'em
When I arrive, my theme music, gotta pound to it
And when I leave, even my shadow got a sound to it
'Cause I'm the god, the harder, the martyr, the father
Completin' the saga while meetin' and greetin'
And beating you niggas completed-ly
Conquer, extremely bark on a nigga
You see me, you deeply carve up a nigga, believe me
But, Kenny, you brought up (You give me pity)
Now give me the startup
So sweet when I spit
Heaven's deep, it was deep
I was sleep, now the guard's up, hmm
Upholding the fundamentals
While most of you boast the rental
Focus on what's most essential
Do I have your attendamiento?
While I clap these raps like thunders
Look over your shoulder boy and wonder
Don't you know, baby? (Mhm, mhn, yeah)
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Just look over your shoulders!
Yeah yeah, you need me (Woooh!)
With God watchin' over us
And me over your shoulders
(All you had to do is look forward)
But what you gonna do?
You pull the devil even closer
Them clowns that you hang with
More ridiculous than white Cleopatra
Or Caucasians telling blacks to go back to Africa
But I digress, you're more, but you act less
Why do you act less?
Even still, when the weight of life feels like a boulder
(Just look over your shoulders)
I'm here whenever you need me
When you need me
Whenever you need me
When you need me
Don't you know, baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Just look over shoulders, honey!
Yeah yeah, you need me (Wooh!)
(Wooh!)
Don't you know baby?
Don't you know baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Whenever you need me
Whenever you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!

I gotta ball for my dead homies
I count this bread for my dead homies
Smoking dodo in your mama house
She get off work early, cussing at us, and kick us out
Popping wheelies on aqueducts in the summer
We stealing minibikes whistle when Gonzalez was coming
And I remember Shaniqua gave you the cold shoulder
Says she don't fuck with niggas that's chirping on Boost Mobiles
I'm laughing at you and praying that the choppers don't catch you (Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never)
We ditching third period just to fuck your school up
We know where you from homie, uniforms can't fool us
Chalk it up like you s'posed
Cornrows with the zags in the middle
Platinum FUBU jeans, rubber bands wrapped around the denim
I remember...
(Ooh, I remember)
I can feel when you around
I return the favor when I'm on stages
And so I gotta say this
How I'm laughing, now I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
How I fought you, I hugged you, I remember (Oh, I remember)
You're forever my dawg, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking 'bout my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo-woo-woo-woo
(Woo-woo-woo-woo)
Poppin' trophies, by the mall
Pat Dawg that's my cousin, love him too
Wishing I could reverse, us patrolling the turf
Tam's burger for breakfast, chili fries on my shirt
Granny said go to church, how often did we listen?
Aw man, I got weight on my shoulder
Aw man, I got
Aw man, I got so many angels to feed
Look to the heavens, they depend on me
This personal, I hope you know my loyalty
Will always run deep
So I put it down two times
Put my candle in the street
Put my faith in where you at
Gone, but you're not forgotten
I fought you, I hugged you, I remember (Ooh, I remember)
I love it even if I get no bigger
You're forever my dawg, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking 'bout my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo-woo-woo-woo

You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)
You can have the world and still need some help (I am)
You outlast the world, if your heart is real (I am)
You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)

Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (Die for)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (In fire)
It’s a secret society
All we ask is trust (All we ask is trust)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Kung Fu Kenny now
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it’s premium

Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be
Lord knows I'm tryin'
Yeah, that's cool
Thirty two shots in the clip of his thirty four's a little nigga with heart
Frustrated with being broke while I was climbing the charts
Penitentiary chancin' and dancin' with suicide
Homie I got love for him
Angel on angel dust, I used to thug for him
Took me on my first mission, transition
Good kid turned rapper, pay attention
This is deeper than you think
We brushed it off as a joke as we watched her get off the stage
With all the favorite accessories
The one's the big budget videos had especially
Just a shadow in the dark, blendin' in with all the industry friends
So guess this is where the story begins, J Incredible, what!
I need some water, somethin' came over me
Too close to comfort, as blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch, let me put the head in
If it's okay, she said, "It's okay"
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
This that new shit
This that new, new shit
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
Watch you a comedy—hol' up!
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count
I need some water, somethin' came over me
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood rush my favorite vein
Am I askin' too much? Let me put the head in
I promise just a touch, let me put the head in
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin' election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust
Lately, I feel like I been lustin' over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction
Lately, I'm not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours
Way too hot to simmer down might as well overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie's, I just need you to want me
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch, let me put the head in
If it's okay, she said, "It's okay"
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5
When I kick it, I kick it as if the beat was my enemy
Payin a picture like duderline, you ain't shit but do do
In the city where see me get pointed that damn it you
You can hide, you get it if you want to
I do karate moves but the crushing tiger just might get broken down by a writer
Yeah the passenger hopped out
There's a killer like everywhere
So why would you take it there
Neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared
That's why my intelligence tell me to keep a banker you
Tell me f*ck you I'll tell you f*ck you back with my index finger
I can flip on some killershit but I'd rather keep cool
Keep it sober minded try not to be a p**sy like you
Nigga that kale cold attack, Cali on my back till my torso break nigga
This is where it's at that's gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5

Make em close as stigiuos, hells kitchen I'm blowing dishes
I'ma lift it, my flow is gift it
She cold with a bow and ribbon the role of riches
I'm blow and listen my car how why you with a broken mission
They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions
Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison
Call adrenaline I got this soul like a poe living
And.like I'm co-existent to prohibition
I'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it
Mother of statistics they rap with metaphysics
And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition
Show some recognition hold your .my pessimistic
Best that ever did it, Papoose is the definition
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window – check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d. city
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!—
Wake yo' punk-ass up!
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, shit
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects, I
Live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust - what?
M.A.A.d city
Compton
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that
Reporting live
Compton, California
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playing
I was so sincere like Nas first name, in Belly
They tell me, it's very difficult to see 25
And if I survive it's probably with a celly
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
In the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys selling weed
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop, that's why I'm
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
I'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
We are, we are (fine)
We are, we are (true)
Through the, through barbed (wires)
We will, will break (through)
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never did right, sort of like a black sheep?
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny, she desperately
In need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
She gon have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of 16, credit card scam schemes
She'll never get by, no how, no way
Welfare recipient, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she's cute
Hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
And this baby daddy is new to the family
Chilling in pajamis, waiting on the first
Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say she can't live comfortable
She gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are (fine)
We will, will break (through)
So while she up in VIP pouring Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire
Have you ever felt like, you finally got life
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
In the front seat of a convertible eloping to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like we just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a God, cause golly
You done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
Now ya lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cuffs
And you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
And both of y’all are steady grindin', doing it the legal way
Just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
You must have joined the Illuminati just to ball out
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
They gone tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So even if you overcame doubt and ya living ain't bad
Know it's a barbed wire that's always in your path
Through the barbed wire (just laugh)
Then everybody say...
'Cause I won't get caught again
And I'm here to stop the trends
You can catch me if you try
Disappear into the night
And I'm gone
So you made it past all the barbed wires?
There's one more left *Gunshot*
Two emcees, that's all we need
This a freestyle off of the top, proceed
I come from the West
You know I gotta get 'em
Yes-ugh
As we rock from off the top
You know I got the sure shot
If you want to see me everybody say hello!
Yo!, give me that motherfucking mic back
I'll put your little ass in the saddle
How you don't see before
Never better emcee that's fucking shorter than me
I'm-ma use that mic
I'm-ma do that right
I'm-ma spit this all day and all night
Anybody wanna come under pressure?
I love ya 'fro, you got the head of the future
Rocky, good kid, mad city (good kid, M.A.A.D. City)
I was there-ah
Now I had to switch it up and get the braids
Now I had to come through
Flow sicker than AIDS
I gotta come true, gotta be real
I gotta be proof, gotta be you
Gotta be us and gotta be due
Step up, emcee
If you want time right now
Come right now
And shine! (x6)
Hold up!
I gotta leave y'all with at least a few bars
It's not about the women, the money, stars, and cars
It's not about the clothes, the hoes
Know who we are
It's all about the mentality
Love making chords
Your life makes you bruised and battered
But that don't matter
If you wanna know
Fuck all that chitter-chatter
Do your thing, let 'em sing
Let the gun-boy reign
What's up!
Trigger finger itching
To trouble one of you niggas
I'm daring one of you niggas to jump
I'ma snatch you out pistol whip you
Then put you back in the trunk
The front page of the newspaper
They say I'm seeing more paper... true
But only if you knew that
I was in your house right now taking the  paper from you
Chick is swinging on the dick like a fucking bat
I'ma go hard, rims bigger than the fucking car
Baby girl say why the fuck you even got tires?
I don't know, just get inside
I fold dough like a notebook
I see money, you pass it up like Magic Johnson no look
Who the fuck taught you niggas how to cook
That's what I'm hearing up in your song
Beat said if you're cooking up the product and your wrist don't hurt when you do it then you're doing it wrong (fucking bidness)
I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figure I would hit the NBA and make me a fortune
Uh, every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' Me Against the World—hello, world, Kendrick here
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan
Bounce-bounce ho, bounce-bounce
This shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
Or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
Pull up on these 26’s, I’m a vanity slave
I’m a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
I’m a Comp-town representer, a concrete back-flipper
A.K.A that nigga, don't wuwwy!
And I don’t know why you fuck niggas can’t see
I’m popping now, every other hour paparazzi come
You jocking her, let her be a ho, why you stopping though?
We stopping the traffic, what you know 'bout them hockey pucks?
Seen too many of y’all getting money, know my turn coming
I don’t know why your bitch wanna fuck me
I don’t know why (Hey, wait a minute, motherfucker)
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
Ridin' 'round with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
The only thing I did wrong was make it possible
I diddy bop and make them titties pop
Walking out the Fred Segal, put my girl on it
Ass so fat, probably sit the world on it (Aye)
Pussy crazy, pussy crazy
Man, I know I can’t tell you about the world homie
Her pussy crazy, her pussy crazy, I fuck nigga, I know you hate me
I know they pay me too much of attention
Bring my name up, it gotta be mentioned
I need me an engine that go real fast
Call it hall of fame once it haul ass
Give me tall glass, Coconut Cîroc
Please, no soda pop, I make my solo pop
Life’s a bitch, her pussy crazy
Every time I’m in my city, I be feeling like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I’m too much for these niggas
Like my Glock don’t think
Grandma in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink
I don’t know why your bitch want to fuck me
And I don’t know why you sucker niggas can’t see
I’m from Hoover man, high as Superman, shit you Lois Lane
You pussy man with the pussy game, shit, we off the chain
We popping the fortune, not the fame, shit, you backwards, man
You chasing hoes, we replacing those, bag and pass them hoes
We fucked her homes, fucked and sent her home, marijuana strong
You know I’m gone, turn my swagger on, am I swagged enough?
My paper long, yep, you left alone, you gets no fucks
Leaning off the Actavis, passing blunts round and round
Told me Mary was a go so we passed her round and round
Your bitch texted me, wants it now so I had to knock her down
Hurt her bouncing off my balls, slinging dick up from the mouth
You let it slide, I hit home-runs, clean her dugout till I’m done
I can be her number two and you can be her number one
Her pussy’ crazy, her pussy crazy, you fuck niggas
Uh, every time I’m in my city, I be acting like my shit don’t stink
Used to clean my Rolie chain with alcohol in the sink
Riding around with niggas that I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin' "Me Against the World," hello, world, Kendrick here
And I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
I’m too much for these niggas, I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch, Michael Jordan bitch
I’m three much for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's just how it goes
All of the studios
Cut off the lights
Persuasive invasion, that could cost our life
Looking though fog, yeah my head at the night
Audio cardio, I jog your brain
Look up to God and he calling my name
Baby you understand me now
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
As soon as the beat drop
My flow is sweeter than strawberries, oranges, and apricots
God-dammit I raised the standards of the status-quo
We be sexing I'm a nympho
For the instrumentals, all right, I admit it
Matter of fact I got a hot date tonight, real rap
Prepare me is Kerosene struck by a bunch of lightening
You looking at me then your sight seeing
And what that means is that this human being is fly, don't try to duplicate
I'm authentic, I see you scoping my style like forensics, that is foul
Tech! Leave 'em by the benches
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
I see the future better than your computers
Rugers on my hip, terminate all intruders
Shoulda' coulda' knew I was a murderer
Burning up the very sun, the rapture
The god is back, they said he'd come, but I came faster
I'm not an actor, if you play Denzel, you'll be thrown through a windshield
The nine merely is handheld, the AK is hands on
Now the battlefield I can land on one thousand mines and don't blow up because I'm the bomb
Inside your CD deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, I demand respect
If I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas in check
Preach Tabernacle fetch the holy bible if I'm lying
King of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel
Because I don't need to get sidetracked, my producer name is Soundwave and he gives me beats by the batch
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
My flow cold, like Aspen
I love to show off when I'm in that Aston
A east side nigga I can get you popped at
A hundred rounds nigga stop that
This is lyrical homicide, not rap
So don't get it misunderstood
Say my name on your bars, shit I'm in your hood
Loud talk, no bite, you niggas is puss
I'm off that bubble kush, thinking about life
Or how to make a mill and spend it all in one night
For the top dog catalog, that means everybody
Several bodies on the shoty don't make it eight rappers
Damn I hate rappers, don't call me that
If you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap
I don't fabricate shit, all I do is keep it real
Eat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will
Hold up, big truck, lurkin' with the monster grill
Four fifteens I got beat like Emmett Till
Put me in my g-mode schooling every hot-head
Tell them about the g-code, like eskimos
My arms froze, popsicle
Observing the game, I'm so official
Oh shit! I need that
I need that sloppy, that sloppy
Yeah, that sloppy
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master that mastered it
Thank God for rap, I would say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
I know everything, know myself
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement, their sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line's for Compton School District
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth
Until I realized I didn’t know shit
The day I came home
We been waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Waitin' for you
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Tossin' footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws mama passed on home trainin'
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh, I forgot, 'Don't Kill My Vibe', that's right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family's ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit
I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
But if you pick destiny over rest in peace
Then be an advocate, tell your homies especially
To come back home"
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
I been lookin' for you my whole life, an appetite

Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 Special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is

Top dawg and we all stars like we run chucks
But never mind that
Take a trip to outer space show you where my mind at
You know where my grind at
Inside of the studio where I spend my time at
Fuck over the game til' I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that bullshit haters die young
You can run to the poor pit
Pullin' off the pit stop
Car like a flip flop
Bitches clap at me like they wanna make my piss hot
I don’t even trip doe I don’t need no company
Me, I’m thinkin long term tryna' build a company
Kendrick the good kid
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today
Nigga, what I depose be so potent
That if the earth dried I could spit back the ocean
Then hop on a jet-ski and start West-Coastin'
Takin' action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came tell him that I be alright
Walk outside then sniff a whole key
Old lady done called the police
Its just an average Joe walkin' with his heart on his Pendex
Don’t be afraid to speak
Y’all midget Max swingin' on Shaq now have a seat
You can never coexist with my momma’s oldest
Kendrick be thy name
I got my mind right
My nigga locked in the pin, that's what my mind write
Ink over my brain
What's up
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
Some people say that I’m rude but I don’t give a damn if she if he if them or they say
So let me start off the third verse
Pickin' up your favorites is our curse
Fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
Fuck George Bush, fuck rappers who love dissin'
Fuck you because you don’t see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too
Because she’s cute and the ass
Looks like a grenade within the denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossipin' bitches
Fuck niggas that can’t fight so pull triggas'
Fuck the new world gas price that cost a livin'
I don’t give a fuck you can keep your props
Kendrick everyday Jay-Z didn’t lie
Fucker
As I move I feel way better doing me I can only do me
I hope that you do you I think to myself truthfully I can only feel later
I’m uncool nothin' but change how I feel bout' me today
Ohhh, ohhhh, woahhh
Uh
Yeah, uh
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let these words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan—
(one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said, my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
If I’m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you’re very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it’s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain’t a prophet til they ask you this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propellin'
Let my words be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And with that—
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon’ stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y’all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Like, who got your best interest?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say;
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
As I lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga—
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don’t let me resent you
I went to Robben’s Island analysing; that’s where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy’s Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth a bit—pause
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y’all
It’s respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ‘em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it’s Michael Jackson—oh
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us "Billie Jean," you say he touched those kids?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling
Let my word be your Earth and moon, you consume every message
And if you riding with me, nigga, let me ask this question, nigga
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn’t wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Doesn’t mean I can’t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
But I don’t know, I’m no mortal man
Maybe I’m just another nigga”
Shit and that’s all I wrote
I was gonna call it "Another Nigga" but, it ain’t really a poem
I just felt like it’s something you probably could relate to
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-
About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
What you mean by that, what the ground represent?
Right
That’s how I see it, my word is bond
I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people
Right
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world
And swallow up the rich people
'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat
And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I’m saying Wealthy, appetizing
The poor gonna be so poor, and hungry
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna be like
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be...
There might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-
Aight so let me ask you this then
Or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural born hustler
A true hustler in every sense of the word
I took nothin’, I took the opportunities
I worked at the most menial and degrading job
And built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it
I went from having somebody managing me
To me hiring the person that works my management company
In a matter of five years, you know what I’m saying?
Now it’s time to make millions for myself, you know what I’m saying?
I made millions for the record companies
Now I make millions for, for us
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
By my faith in God, by my faith in the game
And by my faith in "all good things come to those that stay true"
Right
You know what I’m saying?
You know what I’m saying, I was noticing, shit
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening
I mean, it’s a problem but I’m not finna let them know
I’m finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
And not only me but, it goes down my family tree
You know what I’m saying, it’s in my veins to fight back
Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like
"We fighting a war, I’m fighting a war I can’t win
In this country, a black man only have like
5 years we can exhibit maximum strength
And that’s right now while you a teenager, while you still strong
While you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back
'Cause once you turn 30 it’s like
They take the heart and soul out of a man
Out of a black man, in this country
And you don’t wanna fight no more
And if you don’t believe me, you can look around
You don’t see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers
That’s crazy, because me being one of your offsprings
Of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that
What you think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores
And next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed
For real, I don’t think America know that
It ain’t gonna be no playing
It’s gonna be murder, you know what I’m saying?
It’s gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker
You know what I’m saying, it’s gonna happen
That’s crazy man, in my opinion
Lot a people don’t understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic
And I don’t know what type of energy I’ma push out
Or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes
Because it's spirits, we ain’t even really rappin’
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you
It’s actually something a good friend had wrote
“The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
In order to protect itself from this mad city
The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
But praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness
And the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life
The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He’s trapped
Going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
What’s your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac? Pac?!
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cookin' up the flow
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight for the top
Hub City beat
87 baby 87 Cudi screamin' out "Fuck the police"
Get your top peeled back, don't chitterchat, don't speak of me
I move low-key, I think like a double OG
Inside of an old school bumpin' oldies
Lame niggas get up out of my lane nigga
Before the big rig come through and run over your brain nigga
Me propane niggas for their dividends
Forgive you innocent, Compton all of my uncles wore Pendletons
West Coast rider, bitch I'mma ride her
'Til the wheels fall off, buy more tires
Mmm, say hello to the new prince
Na'mean?
All day all night
Cookin up the flow
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
Aiming straight for the top
Get the fuck out of my business
Because I've been handling the fuck out of my business
Grinding got perfect attendance
Uh, been a winner since the beginning
What do you mean, am I finished? I'm just getting started
But you're on the sideline like Vince Lombardi
Weezy, new born baby? and it's my party
And I'm kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrarri
Like new cocaine, bright yellow dope?
Bright red flag like a red velvet rope
When this shit is in I'm in deeper than your pool, so I swim in towel-less
Bitch, I be and I been ballin'
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Gettin' my career right
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
Aiming straight for the top
Mmm, fuck 'em all, kill 'em all off
Send 'em off to the holy one
Put a hole in one, like miniature golf
Price on your head, and they trying to purchase
Hand over the cloth
Cloth over the gun
Gun over your jaw
Bullet over your tongue
Stick my dick inside hip-hop and shorty's sprung
Every time I get a chance to come over I overcome
Over the snare drums
I tell 'em none
Get it? I tell 'em none
Catholic nor Christian, holding the book of sums
In the back of my True Religions
Never passed the bar but
Just to judge lyrics
Mmm, I should be the judge of lyrics
Bang the gavel, give you a life sentence
I'm in the studio
Gettin' my career right
As I should
Tryna get my mama up out the hood
So don't blame me if I hustle like I'm broke
Cause all my life I've been broke
Aiming straight for the top
As my mind drift and then split
Like the middle of a spliff, I begin to catapult off
I got a feeling in my funny bone that we're not the same
Just antonyms of another age
My soul flock with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a gold D
Haha LMFAO
I hate y'all but I spread love like mayo
Then spread slugs
My brain matter is a brain phantom
See my vision, or my vision'll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so, you copping fitted caps
I'm about to go and cop a halo
The God of rap and I mean it, and I play football with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius, I interact with the inner city villains
That enters your system like a computer hack
Then give you dap
I don't think they heard you why don't you tell them what your name is
Nigga my name is Kendrick, Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick, Lamar
I can tell you what it is
I can tell you what it isn't
No more K. Dot
My mother had named me Kendrick
That's the name that I was given
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
I never kill'd a man
Never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
Put Smokey on my back
Y'all don't want me to win
My people don't love me
Why we hate each other?
My people don't love me
We can love one another
My people don't love me
Why we ride on another, need to love one another
My people don't love me
I said we all we got, I swear to God dog we all we got
My people don't love me
This whole world's spillin' senseless killing
Universe beyond evil, one topic to serve
Be my black people, we be missing the point like Shaq's freethrow
Sean Taylor, life gone because of haters
A nigga he known tried home invasion, went wrong
Days later, wake arrangements, flowers to be catered
That was so impatient, take him from the next man
Cause he ain't got the will to hustle like he can
To get residuals, kill for dividends
This life is critical, we living in a time where
9-year olds tote 9's
Turn 10, it's Mac 10's and coke lines
I wonder why successful black man gotta die from a black man
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
Black people don't love me
Can't be a positive black role model
Leading the future with no haters to follow
Now that's fucked up, if I ever wanna see
Success, I gotta see death? Be famous for what?
He aiming for higher learning, you aiming to shoot him down
He flying straight, you wanna u-turn him
You burn your brother's bridges
His accomplishments making way for your children
No never been, never win, gotta lose
That's the slope that's for the black heritage
We play the fool better than comedians
Disobediant dude no respect, ethics
I refuse to be a statistic
But changing my community don't seem realistic
Show me an African American doing right
I'll show you one that will kill his ass tonight
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we
We stuck together back in slavery days
The bullshit we doing, I know they're turning over in their graves
Yeah the die for the cause, some like Jesus for us
We used to run from the KKK
Man, never thought there'd be days like this
Can't trust your homies that you're hanging with
Damn shame, why you kill a nigga over a chain
When you could get up on your hustle and get the same thing
United we stand tall, divided we all fall
Black people we all we got
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
That's why today, black people let's love we
Y'all better wake up and smell the coffee
It's black on black killing each other man it needs to stop
Real talk
Black people need to smarten up
Change is coming, change is here
Holla if you hear me
In the memory of 2Pac sincerely
Been a G, since standing four feet on the monkey bars
Steal a nigga's box like it was ours
Cars roll up, Nah we don't fold up
Shit, I put my all in them high school hallways
Montgomery never saw the dime bags
Finshed my work, finished a sale right before class was over
Now what's over I'm old enough to put the world on my shoulders without a massage
Never came in the truck no more, we back seat
Times is rough, the only time your pledge your allegiance
It's gutter when the sun come up
When the sun go down
Nothing but tears, no onions
Under the ungodly functions, 187s and robbery will come
Don't go looking for it
Don't look like you hard
You're better off looking foreign, I'm warnin' ya
Your blood temperature, that corner filled with coroners
The neighbors is listeners
Just cause you got the flu don't mean you're sick enough
If California snows then I did it
The 21st of June I'll make a blizzard
The OG aim they guns at the moon
Bullets break through the atmosphere
Fear no man but God, the God of rap is here
And I can see you scared (whew)
Real gangsters either dead or in jail
And his album really ain't shit, he won't sell
No skates on my feet just running the turf for life like football cleats
5 hours asleep, nigga you do the math
That's 19 hours lost, I got insomnia bad
But, I can't complain or happen to think it too much, came passion Albert Einstien gained
Had to hold my stomach for hunger pains over looking ?
This business got too many villians
Superman is back
The cape ain't red, it's black
That's a trench coat
And the note for your information if we was dead this recarnation
Watch your heads
I don't need the hype
They call me- fuck it- I don't need no introduction
No ad-libing my name 100 times for nothing
You already know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm nothing like you new guys
Struggling over a few lines thinking you hot
Cause your homey said you you was a few times
Which is too many times
They lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hrs, you niggas better get your bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
My juice is on, and I wish one of y'all try to rob me
I shoot, and have you laying between the sheets with the eyes leased (Isleys)
The helicopters come and realize that nothing's behind me is behind me
Your honor, I fuck over this beat with no condom
This ain't rap it's really a porno, re-wind me back
Finally the finest of 'em all is back
To define the laws of crack, y'all don't obey
Y'all ain't nice, y'all just OK
You're nothing more than a little John phrase
Theme song to Shaft, equivalent to the theme song to your career
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you trying to grab
I pull out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, you old dudes get out of my way
Let the young boy come through; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay, and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But actually you ain't accurate fucking with the music biz
The industry like, "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, jaws is here, jump in the water
Do he really fuck with President Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
5 or 10 labels like what he hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
Money in front of me, couldn't open the door
Boom! That's that, left him on his back flat
You talking like that, jack, spitting
Rap, but some niggas wack, talent something they lack
My pockets is getting fat, their pockets, they staying flat
So imma just hollaback, they rocking their tiny J's
But niggas ain't getting paid in the spot, like they a slave
12 hours just for some change, man this shit a shame
When the feds come, who you gon' blame? But that's just
Learning the game, you niggas should do the same
They go as fast as they came, cause passing me you ain't gon' see
I go bar for bar, and b, you are just a target, b
So just call me Muhammed Ali
I'm leaving you with the (?), pick up a broad, 'bout three or two
Life is like a puzzle but my level is some trouble, man, you gotta use your muscle, in the hood I had to tussle
Man, I'm moving to the shop, (?), man you're not
Niggas steady talking but barely looking in the spot
I'm so far ahead of my time, I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
I'm hardly a friend with y'all, i hate rappers, where is your artist at?
If it ain't a good picture you're draw, don't bring it to the architect
Often you arguing 'bout who got next, claiming you're running the game
Niggas are barely walking yet, hopping all over beats without studying training camp
Your flow in the same place, just don't rap; elaborate
Try to expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, i ain't saying you're wack, psyche
Like an in-voice, I'm just stating the facts, right?
(?) metaphores i write, in fact, it's been a factor
Don't compare me with them, that's like a shark versus Nemo,  a gorilla to a chimp, Jordan versus Kukoč
A Tony Montana with blow on his nose to a Nino
I remember, uhh
When my uncles
Served smokers
On Alondra
In front of our building, they was my heroes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
Dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
Especially when Sounwave is on his P's
Don't fast forward, I'ma serve you some keys
And I bang like a C-R-I-P
P-I-R-U, high you I'm a I-V
I said a I-V cuz when I be in the studio, I shot
A needle in your veins, take it in vein
Or itch till your eyeballs pop
I'm cold on the cold turkey
I hate chickens but I do fuck pretty birdies
Where your girl at? Over the Pyrex, where my world at
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Uhh, and it's scary to me
Every listener is a strawberry to me
A nightmare, I'm right there like a Siamese
-Twin, when, you mothafuckas gon' learn?
Who fly? I'm a red eye with eye drops
I Big, I Pac, you Chris, I Rock
I'm the first one to do that I bet you never knew that
Back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on?
If ain’t about me about ho it be about face
If you ain’t on higher—learning
There's soda in the pot and the fire—burning
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Uhh, and it's scary to carry
A smooth type flow like a drink of Merlot
That'll freak y'all out like a girl Virgo
When I turbo on any track, it's a Reynold's wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap
Rapping heat, you can fall to defeat
If you don't pay ya tolls like the limbs on ya feet
I suppose this is bigger than life
This is probably everybody, Illuminati
I undress her like a Harley
Lights will flash, cars will crash
Smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
You are reimbursed, put it on my tab
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
Bad bitches, crackheads, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so dope, you might wanna be my crack hoe
I love the way you put it on your eyes
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
No make-up today, no make-up today
No make-up today, no make-up to...
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful, and how long it took
She resembled a model out of a Mac book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
From heaven, is where you got it from
From your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
No make-up today, no make-up today
No make-up today, no make-up to...
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
She resembled a model out of a Mac book
Concentrating on the way my eyeliner thickens
He stand behind me and try to figure her vision
My complexion in a direction I've outgrown
I can never put on too much make-up
Yeah, I know your imperfections I be constantly stressing
From him is where I get it from, they tell me I need to
Smile at least once in a while
I hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows
It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
Ladies and gentlemen
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
No make-up today, no make-up today
No make-up today, no make-up to...
That's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
Ladies and gentlemen
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
No make-up today, no make-up to...
That's fine, but I wanna know do you mind
A massive attack, I haunt ya'
I mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
Mastered that after that I went for thermometers
Holla back they promised us
No pajamas insomnia
Will attack, I attack like piranha does
Hit your block like a comet (Blah!)
And you all know what time it is
2012, mark your calendars calisthenics and silencers exercisin' that trigger strap
Rock with us, Metallica, competition no talented
I'm in a jungle what's wild enough
No lyin' my soldiers dyin' this is Iraq
Alliances lining with stars and bars of a prison rep
My science applyin' pressure, her stretcher is needed, pay the proceeds
You niggas can't see me unless you watchin' the TV or ultra huggin' my silhouette
Mean my dick is the dick of death, mean I'm killin that pussy
Like Spike whenever that Jerry slept
Yeah, Dre
Me and Andre the Giant, 6'7 and climbin'
Whether you storm to your climate
Whether your beat makin' or rhyming
Bumpin some Phyllis Hyman
Hand full of diamonds like Jay fans
On a island with Ray Bans
Glasses palmin' asses that probably came wit a great tan (laughs)
I be the motherfuckin' mecca of these hub city spectrum
They probably call the federal after I slaughter several
Etcetera etcetera Bentley passin up Celicas
They tellin' us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
And Top Dawg can vouch bitch
Nigga what you 'bout, about face with army outfits
The generals here
That mean the hustlers and the criminals here
Penitence reachin' pinnacles of life and despair and me I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it
Only difference is I ain't never askin' Allah for it
Only difference is I be spazzin' and still a proud poet
Put me in a category
I don't know what's a sadder story
Guts and glory
Your pain bore me you ain't really lived it
I take you to a block where they Crippin
Or Piru that 5'2 gun bigger than the torso of Pippen
Show me somethin' different
You either kissin' dick or givin' me distance
You live in a district of dimebags and dummies I know your statistics
Who your boss, he more like my assistant
Get lost have a egg and a biscuit
Break fast when we aimin' them biscuits
Q...Q
Double up, shit, what the fuck?
Get me some my promo poppin'
Setbacks droppin'
Soon they watchin'
I just lock and load explode
Marriotts and Swisher Sweets
LA nigga prolly east
X O henny scrape the keif
Bangin C I'm bangin' B
Put them niggas next to me
Stop and focus get the lead
I'm here now let the hardest speak
Ya all them dudes got ovaries, period
Run on sentence still I'm ventin'
Air conditionin' coolest breeze
Ill diseases
Grip my penis, shoot my semen
Still I'm comin', miles a runnin'
Head is throbbin', she's a goblin
We be mobbin' over bitches
Stick and miss and she the business
Get a witness pussy frenchin
Yes, a mission
Poppin' off like on a mission
Stomp a nigga, crush a nigga
Dust a nigga, copperhead gon' thrust a nigga
Heatin' up the winnnin nigga
Somethin' to remember nigga
Hella sick, I got a spit
Curse with a verse like God told me to kill the shit
Load the clip Heckler & Koch
The hoover king
Natural hoover
Fing ring with a vision clearin' it with Visine
Asian from Beijing
Money make her cum, she C.R.E.A.M
At the start with rain drops
Autobot
Space shuttle shittin on your car lots
Boy style
Could at least got a saturn, huh?
Workin' on tracks like we never been free
22 squezze niggas shootin' off C’s
Please thought a nigga shot 16’s
Rhyme 16’s
Bada bing, bing, bing, bing.... bing
If you want to be from HiiiPoWeR
Please come to friend zone
But don't wowwy
You will not suck on my dick tonight
I'm more focused, see I'm nothing like you new [?]
Thinking they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all try robbing me
I shoot and have you laying between the sheets with the Isley's
We push the coupe like a high speed and the helicopters come and realize theres nothing behind us, it's behind me
Your honor, I fuck over these beats with no condom
This ain't really a rap, it's a porno, rewind it back
It's back to defining a loss, correct, they don't obey
Y'all  more than a Lil Jon phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, a modern day Issac Hayes
Fingers on the shaft, new to the theme song of your career
Old dudes get out my way let the young boy come through, don't mention my age, SHIT
I'm on a mission for pay and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you're here
But actually you ain't accurate fucking with this music biz
The industry like "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here jump in the water
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
Five or ten labels like "What he hitting for"?, seven zeros or more
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
I'm hardly impressed with y'all, I hate rappers
Often y'all arguing 'bout who got next
Claiming y'all running the game niggas is barely walking yet
Hopping all over beats without going through training camp
Try studying a few greats and then maybe you'll be where I'm at
Switching your flow, your flow in the same place
Don't just rap elaborate, expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, I ain't saying that you whack, psych
Like an invoice I'm just stating the facts, right?
The metaphors I write
In fact you've been a factor you've feared your whole life, no TV show
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino
Before I commit suicide, lives will be taken
Mmm, real hip-hop, west coast
Yo, yo
I see to it that a million MCs die, lyrical homicide
Hit 'em again less than 5 minutes exact, then fleeing the spot
This is Armageddon, two weapons, two palms
One man Vietnam
.45 popper, rhyme like the 9-5 big poppa
On a seven deck yacht, eat lobster with my comrades
Gave it to her out of courtesy
Lay back as I hop on my underground shit
Like a subway, derail the track, the real is black
True rhyme sayers, hitmen, crime payers, llama throwers
Hustle in front of corner stores
It's not a threat, I'm doing myself a favor
With suicide
Before I commit suicide
Before I commit suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
I got my mind on the murder and the murder on my mind
You a liar, you and I are not alike
I flow like water, purify mics
Ask Sean Carter, Nasir Jones
Or anyone sitting on the throne
Don't get your career postponed
Women, children, I rode past in traffic
Can't steer, cars crash
I got a death wish, you might be on my guest list
Guns clap in the direction your sepsis
No matter your gender, not sexist
You MC? You better surrender
Killing these rappers
Sparring in the winter, training in the summer
More practice, let's continue
You're damn right, I spit it pretty precise
And whenever the verse is done, means I took me another life
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
(Oh, you motherfuckers think I'm playing, huh? Let me hop on my Daddy Kane shit, jump on my shit, 'Naw mean?)
I delete MCs under concrete
A killer, I put these rappers on their death bed
One shot to the heart, one more to the head
My rhymes so clever I never fall off
From an industry nigga, they all get hauled off
But not from a sawed-off, but more like an uzi
Spit rap, and these succulent MCs get chewed, B
Money, power, respect, pussy and pistols
Hoes pop pills like it's a modern day ritual
But I don't sweat 'em y'all, I just behead 'em y'all
And leave the party jumping like players of B-ball
The B-board, those will die who decoy
Destroy any rapper thinking he make noise
It's K-Dot, the terminator
Fake rapper rhyme slayer
Those who live now will die later
The suicide
Yeah, yeah. So, y'all all curious. That's fine. That's fine, man. I'm – look, I'm a tell ya how ya boy, Moochie, landed his ass in this goddamn slammer. It was Kendrick. Yeah, Kendrick Lamar.
That's right. Shit was wild, goddamnit.
This motherfucker.
We had a ball. Ay, nigga, you ain't gotta believe me, nigga. Goddamnit.
He's just talkin' about it.
Man, you ain't been in here that long. Your perm still new. So, anyways. You know what I'm sayin'? We had some strippers. They let us do everything we wanted to do, touch anything we wanted to touch. I was puttin' my finger in places, but my nail 'bout to fall off.
Kill these motherfuckers. You hear me?
Get that money and come out.
Man, you should a heard what this li'l' nigga was talkin', man. Talkin' so much shit on the block. Man, I been tryin' to tell ya. He talkin' 'bout he gon' get more money than me, he gon' get more money than you. I said, "Fuck this motherfucker, man. This li'l' motherfucker 'bout to get hit right now. Fuck him. Fuck this motherfucker right now."
But you ain't hear what he said.
Nigga, I'm a smoke yo' ass. Now you fi'n' a get smoked, talkin' shit. What, bitch? What? What? Let's go. Let's go. Come on. You're talkin' that shit. Where is this motherfucker? Nigga, fuck outta here.
Hey, boy. By the time I got there, I was already two bottles and three pussies-deep. [Laughs]. You hear what I'm sayin'? It was on, boy. I was barely standin' up by the end of it. Aw, yeah, it was cool, man. We was gettin' down, havin' a good time, dancin', groovin'. Everything was smooth. They was showin' your boy love. [Laughs]. But somethin' was off. I knew somethin' was wrong, man. You know, you get that feelin' sometimes. Like, when a real, cute woman is showin' you genuine love. Ay, that ain't right. But that's when I saw Kendrick out there gettin' down wit' my lady. Man, I spent the night at her house and walked her daughter to school. You know, that means you obligated to me. But I wasn't trippin' too much, you know? Like I said, I was already three pussies-deep. You know, I got respect for your boy, Kendrick, a little bit. Yeah, everythin' was cool, man. Well, shit, man, ain't nobody told me.
This is special, man. As my guy Mozzy say, you know, God up top all the time—real talk, you know. Hip-hop, man. I said hip-hop.
From the jump I thought it was about the accolades and the cars and the clothes. But it’s really about expressing yourself and putting that paint on the canvas for the world to evolve for the next listener, the next generation after that, you know what I’m saying? Hip-hop has done that for me.
I got a lot of guys in this building right now that I still idolize to this day: Jay-Z, Nas, Puff, you know. These guys showed me the game through their lyrics, from close and from afar.
So with that being said, this trophy to hip-hop, real talk. That’s love, baby. Jay for president!
Tell Maestro I need to fuck over his beat real quick
I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9
That's no lie, ho
Rappers out they mothafucking minds so I gotta go
Psycho on these niggas, call me Norman Bates with a poker face
Got the banger in my hand and I'm out to poke your face
Housing authority saved my Section 8
My section be on the west side of Compton Cali, champ
Let a rapper tell me I ain't better than whoever's out
I'mma knock 'em out his Force 1's once I air 'em out
Air jets flying 'cross the atlas, I made it momma, made a promise
Married to hip hop, and the maid of honor gonna be R&B
I'm fucking her too, so please hand me my condoms
Where the honeymoon in the mother fucking booth
You're fucking right, I'm the fucking truth
Tell my momma don't feel sorrow cause her son was a gunner
They found my corpse with a rapper's head in my stomach
Would never stop what you can't see
It's like a red light when driving with Stevie
I steer the game with both hands while you crash
Like Earnhardt my heart to the fallen soldiers
You can either ride, or get rolled over
Sleeping on me, I put you in a coma
So please chill out before you meet the coldest
Hold it
I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my ride
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9
And my soldiers killed 20 of your troops at a time
And I got about nine teens on the corner fucking with marijuana
Jive and heard about 18 rappers say that a bird can go for 17.5
Motherfuck that my sweet 16's be equivalent to about 15 pie
I was 14 when I wrote a rhyme
All I seen was 13 ghosts every time I wrote a crazy line
All these 12 bars in my verses, that's what Notorious and Pac arrived
God dammit I spit just like a Mac 11 every time
I drop jewels, you drop dimes, you pretending to be like mine
I intend to put about 10 of you rappers on channel 9
Straight up, fuck around and get ate up
Money when I sink my teeth in Carter III beats
To you from me, my son the victory is mine, I won
I'm the one
The beat was the pussy
And I cum, hard
When I jumped off the porch I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
And, of course, when that took it's course, hoarse when yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
Killers on side of me, privacy obviously was lost
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed...
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
I walk down the street with no heat and run into beef when I’m just a vegan
Reeking the scent of a saint, sinners smell it then start squeezing
Pellets tumbling straight at my melon, apparent reason...
That was Blooding in public and Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't no kin to me, probably Kendrick I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, shoot as your remedy
Fair enough I got enemies but I don’t bang
But that's the repercussion like when your cousin’s cuzzin a blood
And you’re by yourself at the Compton parade
Life or death
Is you with me?
Wassup
Man, Beyoncé, I'm mad at you
Man...
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
See ya know
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I seen the video with the ring on your hand
It hurt me so
I remember you were 16 on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type? Oh God yes, I was impressed
Hoping that one day I could chaperone while you were on the road
You wore braids with a bangin body
Look like you did pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
But bump that, I was there from the start
Even when Latoya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
Hope you didn't cry cause honestly they were just so-so
They couldn't sing anyway, you deserve to go solo
No disrespect to Kelly and Michelle I'm just sayin' they cool
But you? You are somethin' like Wonder Woman
And I just wanna hold your hand, bring you to Compton
Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand
Eatin hot cheetos with pickle juice in it
Put that napkin down, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinkin' about the good times before she met Jay
See ya know
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
It hurt me so
Gazed at the cover for a whole 5 minutes until my girlfriend hit me
She jealous of you cause I don't love her like I love you
I even make her do the "uh oh, uh oh" just like you do
Like Ice Cube way before the Mac 10 feud
She's like "you goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke"
Anyway, I had feelings even way before you got paid
And I salute Kanye for takin' up for you
But Jay should've did that I thought he had your biz-ack
What happened, Mr. Izzo? Hopico? Fredrico?
He used to be my favorite until he abandoned my diva
They say hello (ay).. Hello (ay)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinkin' about the good times 'fore she met Jay
You never know, hmm...
I'mma sneak backstage at a Mary J Blige concert
With an "I love Mary" shirt, then find Jay-Z
That's when I yell out "Sounwave! Hurry up take the pic!"
Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
Publicity like that? Yep, they'd be sure to fight
Better yet, I'mma steal her cell, then call up Affion
He impersonates Jay well, get Beyonce on the line
Then make up some bogus shit like "You don't rub the back of my knees right
And the ring thats on my finger? Guess what? I'm throwin' it!
Haha that should get 'em
That should break em up like a Kit Kat when I do that, yeah, true that
I'mma put the plan in motion, that's for sure
Yeeeea, man I hope Jay don’t be mad at me bout this song
Start-ay, Wizzle start me back from like the first verse
Like right before I come in
Haha, what you say? Nah, you think it’ll be hot for real though?
Nigga, you stupid, they probably laughing as hard as you
Nigga got the best wife in the world and shit
Run that back though?
Classic, Young Gotti
Gangsta, gangsta
Look, swallow your pride and then eat a dick
I'm Rick Rubin in 85 with the beard thick
I tell you that I'm one up, sun down then sun up
Son, I son niggas I probably fucked up your mama
Pussy, tell it to your honor that this trauma is Jeffrey Dahmer
Took me too many moons set up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kicked, pushed with push broom
Man look, your man, look like sweet water
Big homie said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
I'm just a  young boss with a bat cave
Tell em put my name on the blimp
Ball like I'm Derrick Rose you should know my gym
And spikn' your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not this basket but rather the good pussy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas I make you wait shake in
Blank tapes in your deck, niggas still break their neck
They hear it you need plans with the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to win
Club accounts go 15 racks when you wet like that shit
Hm. These hoes squeeze me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner, I coat food and the..tools make my agenda
This assault what a deadly weapon
Guilt your favourite rapper, favourite rapper last record
We fucked your baby actress on the map just what a blessing
Make that pussy ante up she call my dick anti-depressive
I'm really not depressed with, none of you niggas stressing
That's some of you niggas bless with the gift to carry the presence
A big in Pac and pop with..and with investments
15 minutes come up with 60 seconds
Came up with shit writers block niggas up in this stressing
Like who the fuck cares? who the fuck cares? Even if you get drunk up
Still be a millionaire
You could play a Santa Claus and make sure you're the whole dear
Every verse I put that bitch in the hearse, while boy stear
Uh Church to your pussy and push me get pack..
Verse that you cookie I read it my foot is here big boy
And you don't stop
And it don't stop
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop
And bitches rubbin' on they tits as if they think this monkeys rich
Monkey see what monkey do, you monkeys never make no tips
Climbup the tree shit on you
Paranoid the shit and bricks that can build the castle
Hastle and breaking your picket fence
I know pterodactyls that still exist
Clappin if you resist to cooperate, go home and see their daughters go..
You at risk if you wear bracelet, we want your wrist
We can taste it from planet pluto
Dog Gonnit you panic just like a poodle rip out your culo then kudos
Sevilles with the whitewalls, wipe it off with my shoe ho
I feel you just menthol, meant to get smoked and sent off to your maker
Mean ain't no hood high up in California and G watches snoops
And you don't, and you don't and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop
Yeah, ah
1 2, LA what's at it with it
Kendrick Lamar
You dig that, we out here
Look
Me while I'm in Compon stomping through the swamp to swap meet
Going back to L.A. ya'll
Tryin to see what's poppin
You cannot stop me
We the best, with the west
I've been put up on all the OG's
Dre Snoop, Quick Easy E
DJ Quick and now it's me
Then you see game, now we finna change
The whole fucking game smash it know you lames
Compton you should already know the name yeah we pop it
I shout out the whole westside because I got it like that
And if we had it once then we got it right back
And if you ever had it you won't have it no more
And if we see the back though we to the front door
Taking your bread, crucifying everybody off with their head
What's up?
And you do stop, and you do stop, and you do stop
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do stop
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I’m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear into how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu, my American tongue was leery
Who passed me just asked for 10 grand, stressing about dry land
Blue skies, powder blue skies then crack open
Piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it, told him beat it
Contributed money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said "my son, temptation is one thing that I defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothing less, nothing more"
I told him I didn't have it then close my door
And this a freestyle beginning
And if you know me you know K.Dot TDE winning
We are the champions, we disagree
You can't see it then you best believe
This the cypher, I need y'all to throw some words up
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop
This is the message that I'm kickin' too wicked, straight from Compton
If you come around my city you'll get stomped in
The neighborhood Watts and Long Beach
Boy, you out of reach
This is TDE, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock
Schoolboy Q, we hot, you not
I'mma represent every time I come to the lab
If you wanna see me, homeboy, get the cab
Cause you can't ride with me, you can't see the streets
My homeboy Dave gon' fly you straight in
Sippin' on that juice and gin and that's a classic
Coming straight from Dre and Snoop
If you want us please jump inside the group
This is straight hip hop, this is off the top
And when I rock you feel it
If it's us and then you hear it
Now when I flip it I flip the beat as my enemy
Deliver the bars that everyone agree
I love the pianos and I love the flow
I love the snare drum, I love... oh, I can't cuss on radio
Because if I do they just might let me go
I'm side to the best, I ride to the best
I represent the West, please don't try to test
Everybody wanna rock, but they can't
Because they come from the street of Rosecrans [?]
We drop it off the top of the backboard for real
And that's a swish, that's a net, alley oop
I feel that we are the champions and these Gods'll stomp you
I come through your block and crash everything that you want or put out to
And if you know my flow then you know how it go
If you know Death Row then you know Eazy, then you know Dre
Then you know Snoop and you know we don't play
I said we don't stop, boy, we run hip hop
D-O-T, D-A-W-G, K-D-O-T, C-P-T
L-B-C West, W-A-T-T-S, Jay Rock, he don't play
Niggas and guards, projects
What you want? We can collide anytime with the biceps
You know I'm so foul, you know I'm off of the top
You know this hip hop, you know I cropped
The roof from the birth of the Earth
And I've been doing this since church
With the small slacks, with the soft suspender
If you rapping like that, homeboy, we suspend ya
We contenders, we on the top off the map
We on the top off the globe and yeah this real rap
Sprinting like cheetahs, we run this game and beat me
And [?] man on the beat right now
He gon' flip it and please believe
Every 16 bars is like ours
And if you want it then we 'bout to take charge, what's up?
Tonight's the night I jump off my shit
And every time the words flip the emcees step, but I don't trip
I keep walking, keep pushing and put 'em in a coffin
You often looking for the best, I'm here
We talking, you looking for the stress, you there
Keep walking, you looking for the West, right here
You stalking the flow, you often to know
I want y'all to know been doing this since the days of Death Row and Ruthless
I've been ruthless, the coupe it been roofless
You spit, the words be toothless
But it get like that because you feel it
I got Rikki on my side and she chillin'
Big Boy on my side and he willin'
It's my lyrics, it's my pen
It's my paper as I begin
And he's been reciting my rhymes
So for those out there who didn't know
Big Boy gets on the mic and he kicks an ill flow
Then about 10 years ago I got this call
He said "uncle Big Boy, I wanna start rapping"
I said "what's up, little homie?", he said "I wanna start trapping
I wanna start capping, I wanna start hitting the studio"
He said "holler, I wanna rock the spot"
I said "what's your name?", he said "my name is K.Dot"
I said "K.Dot, okay, I think I feel you
Record it and then press play"
He said "okay", it was very rude that I took K.Dot on
He was one of my little students
Do I get an A,B,C,D,E or do I fail?"
I said "you doing well", his head started to swell
He said "there's this dude in Compton that has TDE"
I said " Top Dawg? Hold on, that is my partner
He want this, but don't smoke any joints
He said "big boy I been a student, about, I'm about sixteen"
He started doing uhh, he started doing these shows
And he got poetic, he got energetic
Spotetic, all those -etics
Any more -etics, any more edits
Then o-etics, and then a o-etics
And then I gave em that pass
Before I got in they had a lack sound
Well you know what niggas
I'mma just play Kendrick
Feel this
Uh, lemme shit on these niggas man
Look homie I'm not your crip or your blood
Homie I'm just Kendrick
Shocked to have scored just as soft as an infant
Why you provoking it don't mean to boast a bit
‘Cause all it takes is a finger to turn her on holmes
Hands down but still dark think I might switch the Jag for the Porsche
‘Cause it got a better steering grip
Young but been a man and you won't understand
Spree wheels looking like a bed room ceiling fan
When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me
(Nigga) I'm from the land where fiends fly like Peter Pan
And the average man got a heat up in his dickie pants
I got some plans, to stack riches
You don't know but now I'm focused like camera lens
And if I know your mans I might give a second chance
‘Cause I don't wanna hurt you
Have ‘em running in herzels
Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
Crack sells, drug sell all in the virtue
Been an artist since Prince played in Color Purple
Weed smoke hydro blow on that purple
2 straps on my side like suspenders on Urkel
I suspend they murk you, what you lying for?
You know you ain't eating like feed the children commercials
Man my children circle around your block
Let out shots and be home 30 minutes before they curfew
When the beef start cooking
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me
Kendrick
Come to me as a man, man
Kendrick
Niggas respect me man (K. Dot)
Stop being some yank nigga
Lotta niggas tryna play gangsta, huh
It's 2004 man
You up in this shit quit it
Be yourself man
Niggas respect me, bitch
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
Before they crop us out of the picture
But I've seen cops circle the block
I puff squares, but I swear, one day, I'ma stop
My nerves itch
On the brink of my career
While my peers struggle for employment
(Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me) One, two
Section 80s babies, blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell, hell (Oh)
The president is black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you can see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'
Ayo, Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here, like, back in 04'
Started HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
(Odd Future's aight) But our future is not
That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine to five
Don't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you're alive
HiiiPower
We focused like the Hubble Telescope
Soul!
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
I'm ready to go, ready to go
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam
Life...
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie, I do, Section 80
Your son will play me if the radio won't
Daughters that just turn 1 'til 21 listen to Kendrick
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story!
Hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
The time is now, my child, come on
See, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent 23 years on this earth searching for answers
'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
'Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper
I am a human motherfucking being over dope-ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar!
Now fuck 'em up, Terrace!
(Soul!)
I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
Section.80
Section.80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
Know they can't control us
Know they can't control you
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight
You will leave with knowing yourself
Our family
Heart, honor, and respect
This is you
And we are HiiiPower
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check

Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand

You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!

I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'

This sh- is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain

Hol' up
But now my album platinum and shit, so what?
This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like "wait"
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent (That's excellent)
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down, can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink
Running through that bitch like it's my house
All up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to
Empty my memory bank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll wait
I've been on my vibe like 20 years straight
Don't fuck up my high, fuck up my high
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint, smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
Told niggas when I was 16
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen
But now my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by (Doot!)
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I am the bad, the good God, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo
Bitch see you at Woodstock, ah!
I'm tryna get these hoes single and this is my single
Bet I bring them dollas out
Guarantee yo girl, get sliced like Kimbo
Turned up throwing up signs to the ceiling roof
Sipping on that 100 proof and I'm dressed in Gucci too
And these hoes jock a nigga so I holla "What it do!"
Where you at?
Bitch I'm in the club, with the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single and this is my single
Where you at?
Bitch I'm in the club, with the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single and this is my single
Move somethin' move, move something
Got these stacks full of hundreds
With a icon woman on my left
My right , my right my left I'm throwed
Wait a minute (wait a minute)
Can I pop my tags (pop my tags)
Can I do the fool (do the fool)
Can I swing my rag (swing my rag)
I'm a Hub City maniac, bitch get it right
Bartender hurry up put them bottles on iceeee!
Bitch I'm in the club, with the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single and this is my single
I got a hundred dollas on me (I'm rich bitch)
Baby girl I know you wanted (this dick)
All righty I might be in some loafers or Nikes
Faded blazer or white tee
Either way she gon' like me
I get it crackin' for no reason at all
Lookin' you see that I ball like a pupil that's soft
And I can tell you don't have what I have
Which is a lot of juice, motherfuck swag
Where you at?
Bitch I'm in the club, with the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single and this is my single
Where you at?
Bitch I'm in the club, with the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single and this is my single
I got a hundred dollas on me (I'm rich bitch)
Baby girl I know you wanted (this dick)
I got a hundred dollas on me (I'm rich bitch)
Baby girl I know you wanted (this dick)
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, you made it"
So I'm saying, "What up? What up? Nigga, I hate it"
Frustrated and I'm riding down them back streets
"Will I survive to make it up out this hole in time?"
Black boy fly, black boy fly
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
His way up outta Compton with further more to accomplish
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
He focused on the NBA, we focused on some Patron
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
Money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
Schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
War's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, "Oh shit, wait"
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
Chillin' my conscience next to a villain
So as I peel through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
So watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly
Black boy...
My mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
Like most of the winners call it
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
The only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shooting hoops or live on the stereo like Top 40
And shortly, I got discouraged
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you just a typical homie
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
What am I to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas making it out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas making it out? That's mission impossible
So I never believed the type of performance that I could do
I wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got
I was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God...
Dick hard like rottweiler
Can you handle it? Can you handle it? Woo woo, woo woo
The whole industry been in shambles
Everybody fugazi, I’m just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people’s champion, I'm animal for analysts
Career damaging verses, meditating with candles lit
I like my raps extra prolific
Since freestyling on lunch tables and park benches
And I won’t mention my 10,000 hours in training
While juggling, gang-banging, my balancing was tremendous
And now we look at the competition as quick submission
They tappin’ out before we even get a chance to miss ‘em
You see my oath is very unbreakable, my style is never mistakable
I can see y’all incapable
To be the God emcees, you know me well
Ridiculous, venomous, hate in my heart, the sinister
I’m rollin’ deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, I flowed tighter than virgin lips
We here to shake the game up and you're flying through turbulence
Everything is high stakes nowadays, that’s how it played nowadays
It’s like an 8-ball to the face nowadays
It’s seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays, I'm talking
Higher power, every other hour since Eddie Bauer
Since stash boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the dead coward dying a thousand deaths, entire lion
Surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah!
This is what they want, I’m the one
This is vintage from 1980 somethin'
I’m the son of the pioneer that got you near the sun
Play with him, bitch you better off voting for Donald Trump
I’m yelling Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me get some head inside the residence
Bumping College Dropout, God bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
A locomotive couldn’t track me down in my career
A bitch right in front ya, chico, what have you done here?
D-Bo, all of it one year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore him
And bitches wanna adore him, but industry shit ain’t for him
Probably thinking it’s for him, only one me
Swallowed the key and kicking the door in, never leasing my foreign
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before them
Listen to you with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
Hundred mil' in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're racing against the tortoise, pace myself it’s important
Lace myself with the wisdom my playerism enormous
Jimi Kendrix performing, this fucking studio haunted (Ah!)
I tell a bitch don’t sweat me (Don't sweat me)
I kill this whole fuckin’ beat if Cole let me (Please Cole)
Ib should’ve never sent the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is just not fair
But why the fuck should I care?
Two young stars was born and y’all gon’ die here
Oh Lord, gotta be the yams
Billboard list need 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he lives on, yeah
Every day a celebration, but even the valley peaking me
Is not validation, nigga this TDE
And my doggies be salivating, salaries, better ratings
Whoa
Murder my allegations and burning my finger traces
I’m sorry y’all not relating, this party is reservated
I kill this whole muthafucking beat if J. Cole say it
My nigga Ib chopped the instrumental, I gotta slay it
I gotta lay it, gotta show you fuckers I’m not to play with
Whoa
Burnin’ my leather-
(Nah I’m just fuckin’ wit cha)
(Know why I go easy)
Wait
King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we livin' again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watchin'
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the optimistics and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winner's district and geniuses with conviction
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they fall defeat, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodgin' haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision, kings did it
I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards, but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm lookin' through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumpin' out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still'd fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you a accident? Are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradictin' what your body language say
Are you a king or you smokin' bowl rocks to keep you open?
King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
I am T'Challa
Jay, I been ready
They say patience
Everybody wanna know why my game plan so strong
Nigga I eat, sleep, and shit rap; I never relax, been a busybody since I was born
"Is he really fucking with Sean?"
I reply, "His pick, I would take a tool on."
Dolce brown nigga, I'm right now, you ain't gotta wait later
Where the CD at? Put it in the disc player
Tell ho ride to it, I do it like none other
Came back definition of a "young motherfucker" with a problem
"Future of the West Coast" I am
And that's real tough
Southern California, Angels, AKA LA's Chucks
Make comparisons when I seen him duck
Man you think "What was to Pac and Big, before?"
I picked up a pen, and when I did, my thumb and my index sore
And then I started writing with it
Found that it flows better, like a Venice Beach sea shore
He is cut from a different cloth
Ya boy is cool, but I'm a different frost
Like igloo, every time I come off
They hanging on the wing of that G4
30,000 feet and still won't fall
Why you do that for?
Why you had to sell out that store
I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)
I can't wait when its my time (My time)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time)
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)
When the lights get dark
And every body quiet, know its my part
I might start a riot
The main event
I never played the bench
Star Point Guard
Never pass up money, I'm a ball hog
Touch anything I get my hands on, into pushin' like Ray Charles
I never had no flaws
"Ooos" and "Ahhs" after every bar
Take your bitch, then give her back
For no reason for, just because, ya'll actin hard
And I got some plastic under my belt, so rest assured
You don't want your moms thinkin' bout pullin' that hospital cord
Went from a Honda Accord, to a Bentley Azure
Back seat got a flock of broads
And I ain't gotta say to kiss it, just like "Sure"
Use Terrific, Easter Brum????????
Who said a veteran can't be so young?
I sound better than half ya'll on
Damn K. Dot, let me see your arm
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
I ain't gotta do a show, my jewels perform
Princess cut looks stupid dumb
Eyes close shut, all I see is dollar signs
And I won't get enough till I'm layed in the grave or hand cuffed up bout one time
No Lie
I can't wait when its my time (I'm coming)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (I'm coming)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)
I can't wait when its my time (My time)
No I take that back, cuz' I got time (Got Time)
I know that patience is virtue
But that being said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (No lie)
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
I hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he felt today
You know, when you part of Section.80
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party, trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see
Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)
And then she started…
And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
"Beg your pardon?" "Oh, I rap, baby."
"How old are you?", She say 22, I say 23
"Okay, then we are crack babies."
"Damn, why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?"
"I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax."
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said, "Read between the lines."
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
The both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
Then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood."
"You know why we crack babies?
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me A.D.H.D did it)
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?
So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
"Hello ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it."
She replied: "Oh yes, you have lost something
{Gunshot}
Is it wickedness?
Lamar stated his views on police brutality
With that line in the song, quote:
"And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'."
This is a public service announcement
We call it Blood Sport

The ugly ones go to Sam Cassell
You washed up like Nick Van Exel.
Let's get deeper in these NBA statistics
My team something like the retro Celtics
Which means I'm Larry Bird's equivalent
To the way I do a verse he handle the ball

R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
Bear witness
Watch me get it in like underage club attendants
The roof go back like it's vintage
The young boy's back to burn your village, the fire touching the ceiling burn
What's God willing when HOVA retired?
Now he back, guess he got some competition on his hands
Who is that? I...am...
You can't categorize me
I'm already convinced that I'm the hottest nigga out
Any comments? I thought so
You niggas is gassed up like ALCO
Scared to play Madden on All-Pro
I'm here to fuck up niggas' barcodes
SoundScan'll never read your albums again (whoo!)
The last one left is your moms (and she even iffy about you...)
Ain't nothing gifted about you
I'm 'bout to, send him right there, he shark food
Piranhas is coming I put beat on you rap dudes
I don't wait on you rap dudes

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
I told you Rock, I like red too
But you gotta kill these niggas out the blue
They don't see it coming
Who ain't a part of the family tree
We travel like an ant colony, you can't count us
Sip Henny 'til my throat drown
New Benz, No Malice
Count money 'til our hands get calloused
40 caliber in the Cavalier, welcome to Los
Angeles, you might leave with bandages
Real life, no mannequin
You pull out, no panicking, you better shoot
Or have something fall on your rooftop, no raindrops
No magician, no magic, POOF
Closed casket fatal attraction
Son 3 hit you like John Paxson, I ain't bullshitting
Them veterans been loved 'em
Talk about bars I got a life sentence of 'em
No man get the best of him
The way I see, why rap?
I'm just wasting my breath
It's all over, the end's here so I'm pacing my steps
Try not to recollect what I know
These pregnant quotes meaning, they give life like semen
Be the reason my heart's bleeding
I'm coughing up blood in my palms as I recite the book of Psalms
Over a slow clap and kick drum, wis-dom
Pay your tuition, this verse is like a college degree
Y'all don't hear me, y'all fear me like a doomsday prophet
When I'm focused, nothing under the moon can stop it
I leave you off the Earth's surface, that's what you get
This ain't a verse this is a Kennedy curse
My real niggas, once again it's on
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running

'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running
Swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the rulers apologize, you ain't ruling shit
I'm Rick Rubin in '85 with the beard thick
Thick bitch type peruvian slanted eyes that squinch
Sun down, or sun up
Son, I son niggas
I probably fucked your mama
With no condom
That's good pussy, pussy
Tell it to your honor
This trauma is Jeffery Dahmer
Get ambushed or kick pushed with push brooms
Man look, your man look like sweet water
Cornbread that break under pressure when he's caught up
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
I'm just a young boss in the batcave
Back against the wall
I came back with them back pains
Tell 'em put my name on a gym ball
Ho, know my gym
And players not allowed
I'm spiking your game towel
And spiking your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go and punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not a basket, but rather this good pussy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas
I make your weight shape thin
Blank tapes in your deck
You can still break they necks
I need to clear it with the bank just to spend
Club appearance go for twenty-five racks
When you getting it like that, shit, it gotta be a sin
So Lord forgive me yes I'm a sinner
But these hoes is with me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner
I coached fools to protools to make my agenda
I'm tofu, Im nasty like tofu
I wish a motherfucker would
Nigga, that's assault with a deadly weapon
I killed your favorite rapper
Favorite rapper last record
I fucked your favorite actress on the matress
What a blessing
Make that pussy ante up
I'm really not impressed with
That some of you niggas blessed with
The gift to carry the presence
I'm popping big shit with label investments
Fifteen minutes go for fifty seconds
Last night, I spent twelve hours inside a session
Came up with shit, writer's block
Niggas up in this dressing like
"Who the fuck cares? Who the fuck cares?"
Even when you Slumdog, you'll still be a millionaire
Nigga playing Santa Claus will make sure you hold deer
Have him first put that bitch in a hearse while Rock steer
Church to you pussies
You push me, get pap smeered
Burst out your cookie
I read it, my fortune is here
Look, this be that shit that make real niggas grab they dicks
And bitches rubbing on they tits
Monkey see what monkey do
Jump up a tree, shit on you
Shitting bricks that can build a castle
No hastle when breaking your picket fence
Know pterodactyls that still exist
And clap you if you resist
And you at risk
You wear a bracelet, we want your wrist
You can taste it from planet Pluto
Doggone it, you panic just like a poodle
Two Door regal, El Caminos, and two more
Cause I [???]
Wipe it off on my shoe, ho
Before you [???] your Menthol
Meant to get smoked then sent off
To Jamaica
No trace of a Laker with Toni Kukoc
Means ain't no hood
Hopping California JACO
Watching Snoop's latest prince get down
Bitch, start popping fireworks
*Lyrics from Snippets*
...always right
And love your mother, she's the reason why we're both alive
That's right, my little butterfly, butterfly, you got a long way to go
Darling, just take it slow
It's what's inside, that heart following love in those veins
I still see Johnny...
My little brotha, we evolve, we evolve like
Butterfly, butterfly, you got a long way to go
I wanna hit line drives…
Wanna lose weight and keep eating…
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
To a baby boy to be just like you, I-I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
Ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
That's ironic (Y-Yeah!  Blow!)
Ironic (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
Salt all in my wounds
Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Y-Yeah! Blow!)
Liberation… Leader…
Popular pie plant pictured here…
Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!
Reminisce when I had the morning appetite
Apple Jacks and after that I hit the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I’m a maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
Tell a story that I'll never grow to 25
Not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
Ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
Nobody gon' abide by your rule
Nobody holding your gun
How come your tongue say, "killa" then kill my mood
Light speed living in the world you know
Little old me, feeling like a live wire
'Til I wreck into a pole, like a right to vote
I'm from the bottom of the jungle
When you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we wanna earn soon
All y'all can suck my dick
All them days at the county building
I'm 'bout to make my mama rich
Cartoons and (Cereal!) I ain't felt this (Good since!)
Scrooge McDuck (Here we go!), elementary hood shit
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
To a baby boy to be just like you, I wonder what's that worth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
Ironic (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
That's ironic (Y-Yeah!  Blow!)
Ironic (Yeah! Blow! Yeah!)
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Just for you, mothafucka, hope y'all amused
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Blow! Blow! Blow! Blow!)
And I run it (Y-Yeah! Blow!)
And I run it (Yeah! Blow!)
That's ironic
This shit make a nigga just wanna shit on everybody
I'ma aim sloppy at a loud mouth, discharge
Dismiss any business of yours
That ya ass couldn't cash when the shit bounce
Everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
AKs for the whole hood
House lick went down perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved it
I overheard it hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mama said I'd better duck, she's nervous
I mean don't intervene with no gun machine
This block stay jerking, the feds stay lurkin'
How did I make it (Past yours)
Well let me tell you like this
Cartoons and cereal
Now I was raised in a sandbox, next to you and her
You was holding the handgun, she was giving birth
I-I wonder if you ever knew that you was a role model to me first
The next day I-I woke up in the morning, seen you on the news
Looked in the mirror, then realized that I-I-I had something to prove
You told me, "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is funny now cause all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I run it
Salt all in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my tunes
Let my life loose in this booth, just for you
Muhfucka, hope y'all amused!
I did wrong, karma came
Crackers gave me ball and chain
State, fed, both can hang
Nobody can't mute me
But I never said nobody can't shoot me
Just another stat to the white folks
Still whip work to the white yolk, absolutely!
Everyday feel like the one before
Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always done
Then you get what you always got
You dumb buffoons!
I ain't seen the back of my eyelids
For about the past 72 hours
Hand on my heart, face to the hood
I pledge every word you ever heard was honest
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mama, how much trauma can I sustain?
Dirty money come with lots of stains
Road to riches come with lots of lanes
Never had shit, got lots to gain…
Just another player with lots of game
Never had shit, got lots to gain
(To be continued)
I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too, and that's random, but so what? Ha-ha
Gimme that beat fool, this a full time jack
I came back with a full time swag
And the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from living large
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one
From the blood niggas fucking with me, crip niggas tryna kill me
It's a legitimate reason why
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Y'all married to the game well I'm 'bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you going through something, this the shit you recite
This is bigger than life, this is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour, bonjour, I mean war like that!
Yeah, straight like that
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate, shall stay anonymous
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies... homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga, my nigga Tony said
"Just do you, nigga!" Show and prove, nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure
'til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!"
Back in the city and tipping on four hoes
That boy got a cold cold, he's sick con, slick on
Dropin red jewels like a school bar mitzvah, ooh
Straight like that
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
Why y'all complain about OG's?
Not Snoop, not Dre, not Ice Cube
I look in the mirror and do it myself
Do I need a co-sign from Dre or Jigga?
But do I need 'em though?, I just need a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost
"Me Against The World" on you mothafuckas
Uhh, tryna record my steelo
Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talking 'bout? I look at your Audemars
Just salute, grab a flute, and pull the wine out, ooh
Just like that
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)
She got me going, I'm all in
Fifty stories, I'm falling
Where you been? Is it planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you a Martian?
You're unfamiliar but still, I feel ya
Energy sending me towards the ceiling
I'm high now, are you up there?
If you was, I would climb every other stair
And I'm wowed, no one compares
Every pageant in America when you was young
Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop...
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)
So now we on, so now we going
We do it sweet, they look bitter
Look at her get up, I hear 'em say
But why him? I hear 'em hate
I laugh at it rather than jab at it
Then continue eternal life as a crack addict
'Cause I'm addicted, and you the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
You definitely know, probably I gotta give it up
Lips, hips, hair drips down her back
(Crazy) Body frame (Crazy) Insane (Crazy)
The only girl that can make time
Then make me, stop...
She looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where's she from? No I.D. (That girl's an alien)
And if I die before I wake, I pray that I'm in outer space
UFO fly away (So let's go-go, go-go, let's go-go, go-go)
You something different, I'm glad I found you
So pretty, I'll never do anything to hurt you
I'd like to thank everybody for coming out tonight
I'd like to share with you, my celebrity scenarios
I promise I won't tell baby girl
I can hold water, I promise
I got this girl named Meagan Good
Well, you could say that Meagan was bad
She made her boy feel good even curled my feet
Now please don't go back to Jay-Z
It's a rap, I used to fuck with Christina a while back
Which one, Aguilera or Milian, both of em
They did this little trick with their tongue
Brandi like to suck it she said she needed some practice
Brooke Valentine like to take it from behind
Face down, ass up, shit I love it when she climb
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
Psych
And about Vivica
I had her way before 50 Cent start dissing her
One thing I know, shit I hope he wasn't kissing her
Man she could blow like a torch
And dick without using a fork
She introduced me to Gabrielle of course
Union, had her on my backyard porch
Legs up film rolling, action, cut
She looking at me like "what happened, get up"
Shit I felt that I lucked up
Gave her my last name, Trina moved on
She fucking with Lil Wayne now
It's OK, I ain't crying about my hand-me-downs
But for now I'm free, "can you please lift up your skirt?"
We can do lunch, later on be dessert
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin'
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, I swear I won't say nothin' else
Psych
And Bow Wow wants to see my cars out the house
He seen the burner on the draw and walked right out
Will Smith knows exactly what I'm talkin' bout
I had the same altercations when dealing with Jada
Baby momma drama I start fucking Fantasia
Nothing serious, she thought of it as a favour
And Lindsay Lohan, made my shit stand up
The Pussycat Dolls want the fantasy of all
Like, I'ma need some help trying to fuck all of y'all
Hour later, that's when Amerie called
OK ma, "you don't have to fiend for the ding-a-ling"
I'll be over there, make sure Eve over there
I wanna see y'all mingling together
Remember that time at my house
Remember that time on the bed
Remember that time on the couch
Remember that time on the chair
Didn't we all have fun
As celebrities can we?
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
Now we can all be celebrity cousins
And if I fuck I swear I won't say nothin' else
I promise, I won't tell nobody else
I promise, just take off your clothes, nobody'll know
Psych
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Oh, ho ho ho, ho ho ho
I'm glad we were able to talk about her vice and her evils. There is an even more important topic I'd like to discuss: the dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan Era. Young men that learned to do everything spiteful. This is your generation. Live fast and die young. Who's willing to explain this story?
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one)
Oh, ho ho ho, ho ho ho
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one...
Genç, vahşi ve umursamaz, hayatı böyle yaşıyoruz
21'imize ulaşalım
Kızlar ve erkekler ile takılıyoruz ve kafamız iyi
Genç, vahşi ve umursamaz, hayatı böyle yaşıyoruz
Dua et 21'imize ulaşalım
21'imize ulaşalım
Onun kötülükleri ve günahları hakkında konuşabildiğimiz için memnunum
Tartışmak istediğim daha önemli bir konu var
Ronald Reagan çağının işlevsiz piçleri
Bu senin nesilin
Hızlı yaşa ve genç öl
Kim bu hikayeyi açıklamak ister?
İstediğimiz tek şey iyi zaman geçirmek
Genç, vahşi ve umursamaz, hayatı böyle yaşıyoruz
Dua et 21'imize ulaşalım

In time you'll learn this is about you
In time you'll learn this is about you
Babies from 80's don't know—know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance
Some of them masculine, some of them feminine
'member the universe used to be innocent
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Everyday that I wake up, I'mma sin again
I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section.80
Show of hands, how many been taking notes? Good. Leave everything on the table now. Vulnerability, this is your generation. Show, show your pain
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
We ain't been keeping in touch
Fell into lust, where is the love?
My independency got tendencies of lack of trust
I look at the street corners as my new woman
Seductive as she want to be, hands all on my garments
And luckily, being in denial ain't the case
Instead I'm grabbing her waist
And every part of her is tasteful
I know you're feelings hating
In fact, you think I'm ungrateful.. I know
I get the vibe you might need some time to grow
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
A freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
Two time, baby tell me ya love me
And every time that I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
I'm going like a thief inside the wind
I know she want me more, but I fiend for benjamins
And lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young boy from Compton
That never knew love because love was never promised
I know.. selfish as I wanna be
Need time to grow..
When the sun fall out the sky
All I have is me in the land of do or die
Now, that's the ultimate high
To the cloud I go, cloud I go
One time, baby tell me ya need me
Cloud I go, cloud I go
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Tryna reach you every day, collect calls
Say who told you that I wanted this door
To slam shut, I just wanted to vent or
A attorney, I can pay you back more
Soon as I get out, yeah, every rack is yours
Commissary running low, I need help
Not too much, I hustle up the rest myself
If you knew me, then you know how bad I feel
Quisha prove me wrong, and never came to visit
And I heard she fucking on some other nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama just get back at me this last time
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Mama, take this mothafuckin' block off
Please believe me, this ain't easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
'Member when you put me in that relay run
All I need is you to give me same support
Investigation saying that the same report
From a witness just might testify in court
DA say I take a deal, or take a loss
I ain't built for all them goddamn numbers
If you can't, then open up the phone lines
Mama just get back at me this last time
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
That's the day the state had take them locks off
I could only help but do so much
Bettering yourself, your own crutch
Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
Your fate and what its gon' be
Thinkin' that my only son just died
Peeking through the window, kickin' through the door
It's you they looking for, raid outside
Rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son, let me say this
Men lie, wo—women
Men lie, wo—women lie
Men lie, wo—women
Look at all the bullshit I been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Shout to my nigga Shellcase for doin' this beat for me too
That nigga look like a praying mantis
Drunk off a hard liquor, pourin' bottles over bitches
Feelin' like the old Jigga, old Nas
Bombin' everything from the streets to the internet
Get the instrumental wet
Shoot who? Shot what?
You ain't popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump
Who you motherfuckers want?
Leave a motherfucker slump, from the fuckin' pump
He's a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in the trunk
Lean in my pimp cup
Ridin' 84's, throw like a [?] pot
Hoes on my jock like I'm from the ATL
Flip a nigga like he was a NBA mascott
Strip a nigga from his wavecap to his [?]
Got it from my grandpop, was raised on them Compton blocks
Every day caught the fade, like we on the barbershop
Goons in the parkin' lot
Ooh you's a fool if you bark a lot, with no bite
Like [?] kill right
In front of your momma
Hold tight [?]
Summertime, perfect for duck hunting
And your women wanna be in my house
With her ass out, she climax then pass out
Like promotional flyers, K Dot be the flyest
Eat ten rappers a day, now that's a hell of a diet
Your girlfriend she all on me
Say she wanna clean my dirty laundry
Bitch I'm K Dot and I'm keepin' it friendly
Pumpin' like a fist [?]
From the pro black, this is automatic rap
Have a seat, grab a snack, we gon' be here for a second
Armageddon might be here, when I finish pray the Heaven has a home
I'm alone in my own galaxy
You'll never have a headstart with a dead battery
And they screamin' agony, when I write shit
Visions of a nigga making mills with a strikin'
Impact for ten years, I've been here before
See this is all premature
I start the war like an instigator
Chopper, they some cream gaters
On a thursday, mix the Vodka with the Sprite
Better yet, roll the dice, watch me come up
He want to [?] with me, he cool, put your gun up
On Macklemore winning best rap album
It’s well deserved; he did what he did, man. He went out there and hustled and grinded. Everything happens for a reason; the universe comes back around, that’s how it go.
On the Grammys snubbing him entirely
I definitely feel like they should always have more of the culture up in there, for sure, because we definitely stand out just like any other genre. We part of the world. We part of the movement. So I think any awards, including the Grammys, should always push for more hip-hop because it’s music as a whole, it’s not just splitting different regions. Everything moves as far as sound and vibrations, and that’s how it goes. And we are a part of that.
I'm with this
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Oh, Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)
Dark as the midnight hour, or bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak me through the back window, I’m a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit' told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Oh, Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!)
Let me talk my Stu Scott, ‘scuse me on my 2Pac
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That’s the real blues, baby, like you met Jay’s baby
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don’t mean you smart, bein' dark don’t make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain’t talkin' “Woo-hah!”
If you don’t see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain’t complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, that’s the context
Yeah, baby, I’m conscious, ain’t no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain’t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I’m talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self-esteem
The new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it’s all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain’t a thing
I don’t see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that’s on earth
Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
Ay, Dre what's happening wit' it my nigga
Still I'm at it, peel the plastic off it, you can feel the magic
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a batch of them banging Dre Beats with me, look where I'm at
It's a wrap when I'm done and I come a long way from a hundred dollars a month
To a hundred mil' in a day, bitch I'm from
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans nigga
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats
Will swarm on me like a beehive
Hop in the G ride
From the West to the East side
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche then you report that you see me in Benzes
I blow up every time we throw up a record
Depending on what you expecting, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
Roll it up in a blunt, I'mma take you on the next high
I did exactly what I wanted that's what made them checks fly
In my direction, you never questioned when I said I
Would be a mogul before I visit 2Pac and Left-eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we gon' test drive
A Lambo in heaven but for now I'm on the redeye
Compton, Compton, ain't no city quite like mine
We can all harvest the rap artists of NWA
America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
"Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
Ayo Just Blaze, good looking homie
Ain't no city quite like mine, yeah
In the city of Compton
Ain't no city quite like mine
Mom, I finna use the van real quick!
Be back, 15 minutes!
I'm so appalled, Louis Vuitton draws
The shit, a booth for me is a bathroom stall
If you're not fond of me, you're comedy, Little Duval
I have a lot of flaws, I'm human before all
I wake up in the morning smell some coffee, then tell your bitch to get off me
Man that boy bad, man that boy spaz
'Til he crash like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the ave
He changed his name, he a conscious rapper
Naw mutha'fucka I'm just Compton's rapper
I might spit some intricate shit for retards not to get
Is that a contradiction? He contradicting himself again?
We not like like Christ is
We all want ices and devices to make the bitches say I like this
People don't understand why I went southpaw
I can't be like Game, I can't be like Eazy
To get in this rap game, I know it won't be easy
Cause my shit different
I know
He from Compton, where he from, have he killed before?
Truth is, I ain't the most ruthless, but I'm not cupid
Before she had two kids my momma worked two gigs
To get out Chicago
To move right back to another ghetto, on Sante Fe playing the lotto
I used to want a champagne two door Tahoe
Until I seen that same truck shot by five-o
Dead with his eyes closed, y'all should've seen him
Off a gallon of cough syrup, but rifles had leaned him
That's why these tough rappers man I don't believe 'em
Y'all wanna be 'em, I wanna grab bats and beat 'em
So they can feel the pain of the blocks I'm from
Where my heart turned numb
Come up off your chain, or come up off your life and have a fatherless son
It's the syllabus for the ignorant militant mind
You sure, you sure
The Kendrick Lamar LP I been promotin' for 'bout a month
Don't worry its comin' soon, like a fast nut
I never be gassed up, some labels they passed up
Now the industry crashin', I guess they got bad luck
Your bad, you don't write neither? There goes another fad
Shit I write ether
I get it in like the Vanna on Wheel of Fortune forcin' your forfeit
With the strength of the prime forces of four fork lifts
This extra scary, this is Amityville
This the Exorcist on ecstasy pills
And if I can't do it my integrity will
Head dog wishes, every Compton bitch is
I mean this shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
They all got a fat ass but lower case titties
Now I gotta mix and match, jungle fever, white and black
Double D, Brittney, Becky get your mouth intact
Man these hoes pitiful
You know how long I took to chop this fuckin' beat?
All y'all do is hate shit
And if I don't say shit y'all still say I ain't shit
And that's ridiculous
I mean that shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Yeah, see I know I can make a lot of money doing this man
It's just the whole process that uh...
That I'm having trouble with know what I mean
I know you just pretty much, you know
Put it in the jar and just watch it you know bubble up and all that
Shame on him! (what?)
And my scrubs on
I'm the chemist that's whippin' it in the kitchen
This here is not for the children
You need parental advision
First you bargain shop
Jorge a visit
Got it wrapped in saran
This is LA man
Unless it be a drought
Then it is somewhere else
Flip your hustle down south
Back to the lesson
Hope you're takin' down your footnotes
Class is in session
Get your instruments
Grab some baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
And a hanger you can stir it with
Split nine Os four ways in that 36
Place it on the triple beam
As hard as it may seem, it's not that tricky
Say you'll get it baby just bear with me
Confidence before compliments
Now let's get busy
This is the procedure
Place it in the beaker
Your water should be boiling by then
Grab a small cup and pour it in
Twist the hanger until it's paper thin
Place the hanger in the beaker then give your wrist a circular spin
But hold on it gets tricky again!
As your hand rotate
You're probably thinkin' it's safe
The muscle inside your arm is makin' your joints ache
You're strugglin' on the job, but don't lose faith
Wait...you got it back soft (good)
Now pour some hot water inside the beaker jar
Then pour some cold water on that
That's when the dope should drop
Snatch the cookie out the jar, grab a razor from the cabinet
Place it on the cardboard, then chop
You're excited that the chemistry worked
This the fiend's appetite
This bigger than life
You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night
You should thank me twice
Though you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
Like most of you rappers
Aw I don't believe that man
There's no way you've never done it before, know what I mean
That was too descriptive
Uh, it's that Compton -ish
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, (yeah)
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, (right)
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, (ad lib)
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
I'm back at it again
My city back at it with ‘em
Back against the wall, K Dot, they tryna pin
But they can fuck with that pen
The shit I write is brighter than blue gems
You better stay in that gym
Exercise your mind till it's strong enough
Stick to my roots like Black Thought and 'em
I'm black with thoughts of Einstein
One word describing him, genius
What you know about the city I'm living
With the souls of the dead is livin'
You don't know about our living conditions
But it's more than just weed and women, gangsters, husslers
Bullet collisions, players , pimps
Who can envision the place where I reside
NWA had mention, Quik had the turn tables mixin'
The first ones to say fuck the system
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Geah, his own street like concrete
Would best describe fit his gutter
But see I'm what's underneath
I'm from the land of organized crime
Disorderly peace
‘Cause nowadays niggas hustle when they order their piece
And worship their gun the same as their religious beliefs
The Compton shares can't forget the police
‘Cause in the hood tellin pigs no more
It be the mark of the beast
And their main aim is just the talk of the streets
That they go , watch em!?
Had you for road kill just like a possum
Niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas
Hoping one day they blossom
‘Cause Compton raised niggas and bitches we barely got ‘em
Unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem
We back that's for my people it's official
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
I don't know if he new around here
Ye it's good to know somebody if you're new around here
‘Cause it ain't too safe for you to cruise around here
Niggas stick to your ass like glue around here
Take New Jersey and fit it shit whatever you don't care
It ain't no magic trick if they make your shit disappear
The outcome is severe, and some of this casket will last a day
But I'm amazed cause the young boy been here for years
I seen niggas shed blood blood tears
Hope you not try to plan for the future niggas will mute you
Introduce you to rugers
Clock you in like Tap Judah
Minus the actress and the producers
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin' nights, homie that's Compton life
Rollin' dice, gangsta rights
Hood advice, homie that's Compton life
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar
This for the town, nigga
Caught a murder when his homie died, judge caught feelings
I'm on Rosecrans, chilling right inside Best Outlest
Elementary McNair, say what's up to Vanguard
Centennial High, had me swimming with a pool of sharks
Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it neutral
But I'm well aware that a square can get shot too
Most Crip and some Piru, that's just how the game go
Bitches with fat asses, burning in the stashes
Murders in July, call that summer time madness
Swear to God, when I make it big, your voice'll be heard
Me, I'm just a good kid, tryna keep it positive
Compton, concrete jungle
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in Compton
These streets will make you or break you
Expire or inspire you
Let's hear it for Compton
Earl had got disciplined for not catching a fade that week
Shit had made him stronger though, yeah those were the good old days
Eating Tam's burger while my Juvenile CD had played
21 outside maybe sideline pop
Yellow tape on sidewalk damn somebody got popped
Hoping that I live a lot, I don't want to die young
Please don't come shoot up my party, I just want to have fun
Sheriffs in my rear view, mother fuck the police
Since the Compton swap meet, black and red LA gears
Pac was on Rosecrans nigga I was right there
Free my nigga J-Dub and both of the J-Mans
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
I'm talking bout Westside Piru, N.H.P., Campanella, Carver Park
Front Hood, Nutty Blocc, Lantana, 151, Park Village
Cedar Block, Santana
Burgundy and Blue bandanas
Peace! Peace!
Fruit Town, Kelly Park, Southside, Elm Street
Poccet Hood, ATF, MOB, LPP, 135, VTP
Atlantic Drive, Limehood, NHC, PBC
Peace! Peace!
Tragniew, Compton Raymonds, Tree-Top, Mona Park, T Flats, 7 Os, 155
Compton Swamps, Holly hood, T Zones
All a nigga really want for us to keep
Peace! Peace!
But shit that a take some time and more time
But I'm pushing to get us there in no time
Me, I'm just a good kid hoping I can spread love
(Outro)
E-S-T 1987, Dominguez Hospital that bitch was on Bullis Road]
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me
Hey lil pretty lil, pretty lil, bish you
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me
That pussy got a spell on me
Greeting boys and girls (Greetings boys and girls)
My name is Petey P (My name is Petey P)
Kendrick's childhood imaginary friend (That’s right, that's right, that's right)
Your pop guns and fireworks (And sing)
And sing along (Along)
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Kendrick, you remember that one time when we was...
I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burger stand at '95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, chicken from Kentucky Fried
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the move
When nothing else to lose but a burger flipping job
Close my eyes inside the swap meet and imagine it's a mansion
Howling at the moon, what’s a pack of hungry babies?
Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit, if better days was on its way
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn
Oh yeah, I remember that, it- it was the ravioli with the hot sauce in it, right?
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Am I right?
Oh!
Blow it like Coltrane, blow it like Coltrane, yeah
Don't forget to sing along by the way, sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
And all the ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
All the ghetto girls say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
When we grow up, when we grow up (Aye, oh)
Ghetto children in the world say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
All the ghetto boys say, “that’s my car” (Aye, oh)
When we grow up, when we grow up (Aye, oh)
Nigga you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and shit?
Played the passenger I think it’s five years after eighty (Yeah, yeah that)
Seven, do the math, ‘92, don’t you be lazy (I won't)
Like a flame from a trick candle, everybody got dental
Insurance ‘cause we ‘bout to floss, you get that couch I sent you?
Of a scholar but, shit, not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it
Say that you got me, if not, I’ll dig in your drawer for it
The swap meet was the bulls' eye like Tauruses
"Papa, you really telling me we can just get some more of it
If we run out?" He said, "Lil' nigga, today the poor is rich
Don’t tell your mom that you seen a Molotov bomb
If she ask just know you have to lie and son don’t forget
Bitches ain’t shit, hoes ain’t neither
Niggas gon' snitch, watch the company you keeping
And one day you’ll put money in the ghetto when you got it
Rather than having to hustle off these Rodney King riots"
That- that’s right the mothafuckin’ Rodney King...
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
That's crazy
Don't forget, still sing along kids, still sing along
When we grow up we gon go and get us a million
Please sing
Spend it all in front of the county building
Yeah, Kendrick Lamar, tone what up,check it out
As the day go I let the beat rock
Then put my thoughts inside the cradle, hip hops
God Father plant the seed, you should be my son
And if you niggas hot, I guess I am the sun
I'm a degree away from global warming, this a warning
I hear an Instrumental then I turn to Norman
I’m always performing
Like it’s my last morning
Before I sit with the Lord and see my mother mourning
Ground level never been important when I walk the earth
Told me that he need a verse, I blessed him with a couple of lines
Bear hugged a few bears, wrestle with a couple of lions
Fuck off, Kendrick Lamar
My town I rep it till im off this map
Chillin in the bricks with bricks looking for fifty
It’s still in my blood, nigga it’s all natural
Welcome to L.A gangbang Capital, Still rocking my colours I wasn't sworn in it
I ain't a millennium baby,look I was born in it
Bless the beat when I speak everytime, cocaine bars that tweakin off every line
Flow bolder than a cold on a polar bear, shhh im the one that this rap niggas fear
Lil Watts lil Compton in the dash of the East
A natural beat
Got me like a savage and beast
The rap game start to look like an immaculate feast
So listen when the package complete
Got me spittin' accurately
So the realest MC is what I happen to be
You can vibe wit it or move back
These new jacks gettin blue black
With boom bap I proved that
Know my Golden State affiliates can prove that
On my menace shit Long Beach Venice shit
Primitive the way I crafted this all the penmanship
It's intricate now go and start the sirens
My microphone's on the flow is sparking violence
We the best duo out since Bo and Marcus Allen
You boo-boo, you T'd
You turned down, you thirsty
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
And by the way I'ma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I'ma cut you off
'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Shut the fuck up... hoe
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say...
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
Or at least inquire similar desires
I'm talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed 'em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God
Every time you come around
Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art... now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I'd never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Dang, and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep
Y'all be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say, oh my God, shut the fuck up
Keep it running, Ali
Every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah
He say, she say
So tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Tell 'em, "Shut the fuck up!"
Yeah, bitch, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you thirsty
Tell 'em "Shut the fuck up!"
Yeah, nigga, you boo-boo, you T'd
You turnt down, you thirsty
You thirsty, you boo-boo
You T, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you T'd
You boo-boo, you turnt down
You thirsty, you T'd
You boo-boo, you turnt down
You boo-boo, you T'd
You weak, yo’ bitch weak
Yo- (laughs)
You boo-boo, you T (laughs)
Keep all that
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
See it’s known today that the human race is nothing
No morals, no standards
No, you don’t have to have a lot of money
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it’s as big as a crew, some say it’s as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand for it as if it’s as big as a religion
Yeah, follow me, uh
Picture Kendrick, one of the greatest emcees
Roamin' the coast like cellphones on airplane mode
I been at bat for so many years
Now I'm out swingin' like open marriages
Carry this terrorist flow, say that I'm arrogant
Stop playin', thinkin' back to rhymin' over computer mics
Knew I was tight the moment the speakers had broke
I dipped and dabbled in chronic, but never knew I was dope
You see, my uncles is killers, but never knew I could smoke
A rapper like a .357, do worse enemies
Let it rip through your briefs, till it bite through your culo
I'm Cujo, (you) sumo actor, (me) sumo rapper
Heavy in the game, follow my name, K-Dizzle
A twenty-two-year-old dream, got now
Like a person place or thing hands down like 6:30
Give me respect, I hold it down for DJBooth.net
And they tell 'em K-Dot got necked
From your baby momma
On my momma, brain like a genius
I'm travelin' to Venus
Where aliens got pistols 'round they V-necks
Snub-nose, Kleenex
I suppose I done drove artists to a place
Where the daily deceased sleep at
Competition comin' up short like a dwarf
Mano e mano, you ain't ready, I'm deadly as plec disease
God-given, you trippin', I've walked the Seven Seas
Moses, cold as they heart, cloned as art
Foamin' at the mouth, wildebeest slaughter opponents
'Bout business when I kicks this, ridiculous symphony
Central and Rosecrans, Compton don't raise killers
They raise Conans with survival tactics
You love drama? Well, welcome to the land of theatrics
Even a preacher be packin' like role managers damage your goods
Cameras roll through the hood, tryin' to get that footage
Even newscasters come to your block when you wouldn't
This the city at it's best, have a seat, hold your breath
Kendrick Lamar, K-Dot, that is, ha-ha-ha, ha, yeah
Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best?
Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress?
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of Buffy
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy awards as best dressed
With an address next to a beautiful actress
Ear hustle on a nigga that's constantly braggin'
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop 5 bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area or carry the birds to VA
Let the Clipse distribute the work all day
Every three weeks flip three to six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a trump
Donald that is
In time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
(And when I do I do it again
Then I go back
When I do I do it again
Then I go back
Thug it out)
Go out and get it
(But for now I'mma go head and doug it out
I gotta rhyme, rhyme)
Go out and get it
So welcome to the story of my life
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and my wife
But as you listening to K-D-O-T
Man, me and my girl split the bucket of KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say is "Damn
These niggas that much better than me, baby?"
I don't think this is meant to be
Cause I'm always losing self esteem
She paused the iPhone then said, "Huh?"
I repeated what I said then she replied, "Shut up."
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success, I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
I got, I got, I got, I got—
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And Nazareth gon' plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA
Yeah, I like it
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? (Haunt)
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
I know the feeling haunt you (Haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Motivation realization in my DNA
I got
Devotion and emotion in my DNA
Yeah we only want the prize
Woman arrested for gettin' naked
Barrel straight through the peephole
Tell your parents that we home
Propaganda that we own
Crime infested, not contested
Block conventions and street zones
My redemption won't be long (woman)
My religion, fear no man (arrested)
Warrior, Conan, oh man (for gettin')
Horror stories and romance (naked)
Kettles burnin' with sin in them
Children don't wanna hold hands
Tourists don't wanna visit and purists die in the maulin'
Fire burnin' through skylines
Follow fortune through guidelines
Stolen Porsches and baby abortions at an all-time high
More divorces and child support lawyers, callin' you, "Dada"
Feds tap on your wifi (skrrt)
Meds makin' you crazy, you dip your head in some agua
Hit the dip while you're drinkin' it
Fuck it, flip on the stop sign
Duck a clip in that drive-by
Fuck a bitch in the Honda
Sell a brick to a minor
Makin' wishes for Jannah
Pump your fist up far higher
Welcome to America's future, the great ruler (woman)
Public Enemy's first born, ready to shoot you
I hate when people at me
His eyes bloodshot red
Reminiscin' on them playing Sega with each other
He was hurtin', I could see it, plenty tears, no Kleenex
I stood by his side because that was my homie
Gave him a hug, some of his brother's blood got on me
Stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hangin' with
I wasn't sure, so I gave him no answer
But I was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
Revenge, what do you say to a good friend
That just lost it and grabbin' choppers out of the closet?
But he was like, "My nig, this feelin' is more than personal"
I stood down
He hopped in a four-door Honda Accord
Before he bent the block, he said, "K-Dot...
"...You wouldn't understand"
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
Or, at least, try to understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
Candles on the pavement, postcard read
See, this wasn't in our plans
Put that Malcom X book down, then raise that K
Look the devil in the face, from a sane eye
Cast the spell on you like Akeelah and the Bee
Every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted mind
Substance, time, is no longer an issue
We don't have it, so pass the tissue
Then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can
And tell her you understand, but you don't understand
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
And, hopefully, you'll understand
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s
The Desert Eagle shotty and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh woe)
He said, "Dot, I went on one, do me this favor
Dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you
This as critical as it gets, my nigga, I need you"
I said, "Alright, so what happened?"
I didn't care who I was hittin'"
That's wild shit, but anyway, I got you
I woke up the next mornin' with a cold
Allergies got me sneezin' and wipin' my nose when it was leaking
Checked the medicine cabinet, lookin' for some DayQuil
But all I seen was some Aspirin, s'just my luck
Walked to the parking lot, that's when I seen the faces of death
Said they was lookin' for my man, with a chopper in they hand
Prayin' it would jam, but you don't understand
(These streets can turn a kid to killer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a menace
Can someone just pray for me, oh woe)
I'm tellin' you, do you understand?
(The city pressure
The AK-47, twin MAC-11s)
Huh? Do you understand?
It's like
That I've been a part of
Nah, what you get outta, outta not writing your stuff down on paper, you get the more-you know the...expression, the feeling yourself. You know what you want to say; instead of reading a paper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you wanna do it narrated...
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to, die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway
When my childhood friends get sent away to prison on their first offense
It's fucked up but listen, we study God but don't know him
Criticize people that work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their kids
Cus' we ain't gonna win
(shit)
Don't mind me I'm just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Cus' I'm disappointed at my self sometimes
Self-esteem gets lower than night strippers
Hard to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by true crimes
Turn it off then come back the next day, it's here to stay
Struggle that is
I'm so infatuated with knowing something that's waiting after this life
Know he see me spillin' my heart, hope for it soon
Wait a minute K. Dot! you said turn it back on, bring it back
If it was cool for you to be a casualty
Say that I'm weird but obviously you didn't get it when I said it the first time
You're listening too far if you hear this part
I fast forward to common thoughts of a human
Stick heroin needles inside politics, this is crack music
O-pi-um, inside the veins of them, I don't abuse it
Capture each moment like film, photo-shooting all my enemies moving
Direct them to a casket
Give it to 'em only if they ask for it, if they want...
If they wanna see reality [haha]
I'm losing you again ain't I?
Ain't I, the perfect candidate to represent the fifty states?
Black President, they don't wanna see that
It's evident...pain is pain
I swear to God that we live in a Matrix
Kanye, west-coast niggas do it the best
We learn to live with it I guess
I mean die with it, since we're already dead
Trying to cross over to heaven, that's what I said the first time
Get it? Now little boy I gotta sit you down
Teach you about the things that we live around
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...
When the dreams was reality and money was love
What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity
Chasing the wind, striving after this vanity
American dream or Scarface fantasy
Kilos of coke and the arms of black families
We use to it, our hearts draped in stone
A mother's dreams for her baby boy to come back home
Cus' he out pushin' that chrome, pursuing that cash
End another niggas dreams when the fo-fifth blast
Now another mother screams picking out his casket
Harsh reality, it seems like it's simple mathematics, it's not
It's trigonometry (trigganometry) divided by some real life
And he'll do it again just to get a mill' twice
It's not a dream it's reality, look where it's at [ugh]
No nickel and dime, one shot pettiness
World trade happened on the world stage
On video stations women gyrating
Parading around, mind-raping the youth
Fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out, fade me out...
And as complicated as it seems, if things we imagined actually happened?
And real life situations was artificial
They say we only living to, die
Imagine if we're already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross over to heaven we're confusing ourselves
Planet earth's like Oceans 11, we're plottin' for the getaway
I'm the man up in this piece! You'll never see the light of da..
Who the fuck d'ya think you fuckin' with? I'm the police!

Trick on a dumb bitch is nothin' I might do

That means dough, gettin' my pesos
Gecko or Geico, whatever it stand for
Red and blue flags, yours are like a rainbow
Pants hang low
Born with the best flow since LL was rockin' a kangol
87, one man, eighty weapons
I go hard without usin' protection
When I pull out, make like R. Kelly, get to steppin'
I'm the best at this profession

A sexy bachelor, hit 'em in your strokes
Never bust a nigga, goin' down your throat
The Phantom, not rich enough to cop yet
But picture [?] for the niggas outta pocket
I can exercise you, you can get a [?]
When I lean back, don't dance, give me [?]
Killa got that heat, we know killas in the street
With the heat that make you feel like a fat boy at the beach
So don't try to run up on [?] talkin' all that [?] and shit

So swiftly, come get me
If I had every bitch in the world, boy, you still ain't fuckin' with me
I'm 'bout my money strictly, as long as I stack my banks up
I'll have enough Young Bucks to fuck with 50
So where I move, it's comin' with me
You down right, play with me, think I won't take your life
The scope'll have more dots on you than a website
I'm 'bout my head right and yours left
That's K-Dot, oh you ain't heard? Shit, that boy hot

Add up faster than cell phones on speed dial

(Work out for me, work out for me)
Feeling like a mother fucking animal
Hannibal Lecter of 2012
Elected to execute every rapper that has excelled
If music is your calling
You're falling, pick up yourself
If a nigga said he could see me
Bet he told you in Braille, fucker
Put you in front of the street then buy you some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, should've worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldn't bare my triumph
I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Watch they face drop when the beat drop
Me and curtains ballin' like peewee kirkland callin' 'em kirk franklin
Stomp 'em, leave 'em hurting
They tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as O.D.B
That's March 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it like sweet chin
Music on Chuck Norris
Look, look, look
Hm, story of this eastside nigga
Where across the tracks, opposites attract
Niggas go hard for the color of they flag
Dope man money, welfare recipients
Unfit mothers never heard of obedience
Ho's so devious, niggas all talk
Right around the corner, deja vu
Same old shit, something like re-runs
Gotta stay sharp, if you slip then you bleed ?
Guns in the Levis, 501s
Uh, that's how it is on these L.A. streets
Look, catch me sitting in my truck
Remy in this cup
No tags on this bitch, but I don't give a fuck
I ride until the wheels fall off
That's some real shit
Never let them get in your mind, never reveal shit
Let a nigga know your feelings, business and all
He's the type of nigga riffing and wishing on you to fall
Fake niggas try and impersonate your character
That's why I got my mother's fucking eyes on them scavengers
Watch 'em!
Pray for late Charles, why he have to pass away?
Thinking about my pops, then the stress starts to kick in
Roll me up a fat ass blunt and start drinking
Damn!
I stop selling dope because niggas started telling
Sex, money, and weed: the life we start living
Stay on your job
Keep your eyes open on every corner
The blink of an eye, and you're a goner
No wronger, tell 'em about the pains of this hunger
And the ? going bonkers
Just living my life up on some cool shit
So, nigga just miss me with all that bull shit
It was always me vs the world
Until I found it's me vs me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We gon' put it in reverse
And I am telling you once again
That my—
Oh, Lamar
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny mothafucka
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mil twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin'
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
They didn't kill him; in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

Ali, mix it
Ha ha ha, Bad Love, Whaddup?
Ha ha ha, ha...
I spaz out 'til I pass out
There’s clarity in my vulgarity for a sass-mouth
Your parody’s not funny
As long as the lord love me, I’m good
I could: be the best rapper but I’d rather be the answer that capture the violence that coincides in my hood
I should: stick a fork in this music business
But I’m too deep in it like pussy on my penis
Devil’s kitchen in Phoenix; that’s the heat that I’m bringing where the shade at?
I’m L.A. radio and good music, boy, I don’t play that
Ugh, Walking a thin line from thinking like Einstein
Like a man 99 years old locked in prison
Get exposed like an R&B ho with a sex tape hidden
I’m always for the business, forever you can feel it
Whether you Crip blue or a nigga that hemorrhage
My penmanship is like me and Langston combined to the hip
Now understand that I’m all that you’ve got
Give me chance, give me ears, give me hearts, give me props
Oh, you spit? Well the retarded drool is back
See, I’m the author of the authors, the father of the Austin Power fajja
Who can bust like a charter, why bother?
I know a jealous serpent is a burden to my life
But still I carry on like luggage on a flight
I can give you insight only if you’re in sight
And I ain't even tryna give it my all - yikes!
You couldn’t see my pedestal, because you’re afraid of heights
Cloud 9, where you can find
Me in my dime like Roosevelt in his prime
Wait 'til I’m in my prime
The moon and the stars will align on my Louis V. belt like Orion
It’s not all about punchlines, I don’t do that
Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success
I can never digress, ‘less I get demoted to death
Even then I’ll be the best still, like a petty theft
I will: conquer my biggest dreams
Once you open the cage, I bet that I’ll spread my wings
And all I got is bad credit, big ears and big head
But still they’ll feel me, cause we all ate cereal
Humped our momma's friend's daughter while they bump the stereo
Backflips on shopping carts, free lunch at the park
Watched Power Rangers after school; here we go
I’m so Comptonized, I will never compromise
For no faulty ass A&R or CEO
But we’ve been here for decades, and I vouch for that
Open your mouth for that, speak well like a great debater over iChat
Get your other eye cracked
I don’t rap, I-Iraq and declare war
I enjoy watching enemies' blood pour
I came up lower middle class, not poor
So don’t feel sorry for me, I don’t need y’all to love me
And if you feeling froggy to leap, then feel free
My feeling’s all aside, my pride is deprived
By the ultimate prize I'mma get when I see your suicide
New Kung Fu Kenny
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a fuck
I'm willin' to die for this shit
I done cried for this shit, might take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go eye for an eye for this shit
D-O-T my enemy, won't catch a vibe for this shit, ayy
I been stomped out in front of my mama
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch, all my grandmas dead
Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my Telegram like, "Be cautious!"
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga
We ain't goin' back to broke, family sellin' dope
That's why you maney-ass rap niggas better know
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
Seven figures ho, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin' digital and physical on all y'all, ayy
Bunch of criminals and money in my phone calls, ayy
They never been ready, yeah, I know, yeah, know, yeah
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option
If I gotta slap a pussy-ass nigga, I'ma make it look sexy
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element
Nah, take me out my element
Damned if I do, if I don't (Yuh)
Damn, damn, damn, it's a goddamn shame
You ain't front in line, get out the goddamn way
Niggas thought they wasn't gonna see me, huh?
Niggas thought that K-Dot real life
Was the same life they see on TV, huh?
Niggas wanna flex on me and be in L.A. for free, huh?
Next time they hit the 10 freeway, we need a receipt, huh?
'Cause most of y'all ain't real, most of y'all gon' squeal
Most of y'all just envy, but jealousy get you killed
Most of y'all throw rocks and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise that you'll see Candyman
Last LP I tried to lift the black artists
But it's a difference 'tween black artists and wack artists
If I gotta go hard on a bitch, I'ma make it look sexy
I pull up, hop out, air out, made it look sexy
They won't take me out my element

Hard times like, "Yah!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma come in heaven
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
So I went runnin' for answers
It's over, it's really over
Kobe really retired, it's crazy!
It's just a trip to even be doing this right now
Call in marks, Kendrick take one
What can I say?
I mean really, what can we say?
Day by day, season by season, twenty, to be exact
Growing up watching him paint murals
Using this building as his first studio
Using L.A. as his canvas
Restoring crowns back to where they belong
Under royal banners, purple and gold
The color of royalty
My one man L.A. king
Kobe
All season has been his goodbye
Him to us, us to him, to the whole world
Still got magic, but he made it magical
From Compton to Crenshaw
We were all witnesses
To all things that was him
I mean, we shared with him the world
Kobe, inside the three point arc...
Kobe Bryant has hit a shot at the buzzer!
WOO!
Soon enough, he became our identity
If you wasn't born and raised here
Or never lived here
You probably would never understand
I'm talking about the 81 points
I'm talking about the afro
I'm talking about the alleyoop to Shaq
The game four overtime takeover in the Finals
Kobe
I'm talking about the posterizing of Steve Nash
I'm talking about Dwight Howard's rookie year when he got baptized
You remember that
Kobe bodied him
The five parades
Kobe
So I ask, how do empires last when there's no longer an emperor?
I mean, we got you
But at the same time, we got you
I'm talking about your blood, your sweat, your tears
And nothing would ever replace that or erase that
Forever great in our hearts
So with that being said
It's simply respect due
Our due, forever
Kobe
I take a sip of Hennessy and then get pissy drunk
I ain't a drinker, I'm a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
To witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
I found myself losing focus at a Sunday service
Embarrassed so I start questioning God, "What is my purpose?"
He said to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
Spread the word and witness, he rose on the first Sunday
I said alright, enthused that my Lord gave a listen
I opened my Bible in search to be a better Christian
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give in
I'm giving testimonies to strangers I never met
Hopped on the pulpit and told them how I was truly blessed
Felt like I'm free from all my sins when the service was over
Then lost my faith again
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
Single black parent from Compton raising children of four
That's four innocent bastards 'cause, papa, they don't know
Her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
Can't find no one to watch her kids, so she pay her sister
Her baby daddy ain't 'bout shit, that nigga ain't 'bout shit
Spilt his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
She pray to God every night, hoping that he'll mature
And maybe one day his kids something that he'll live for
Baby wanna go back to school, but she need some help
Because it's hard trying to pay the bills when you're by yourself
She thought about credit card scams, 'til she heard a voice
That said, "The Devil is a lie, make a better choice"
And so it's back to McDonald's and every month dealing
With those crazy ass people at the county building
Looked to the heavens and asked Him to make a better way
Then got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then lost her faith again
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
I had dreams of holding a 9 milla to Ray's killa
Ask him why as my eyes fill up
Each day it gets more realer, orangutans bang like gorillas
The rats lurking, vultures circling the serpents
I flirted with the ideal of caressing the steel
To make karma come faster than she normally will
But it never rain in California unless the pistols out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience till my faith start responding
And if I get no answer, just know I tried
I should have never looked into his son's eyes
Rayshawn Boyce
What am I gonna do
Gotta have faith
Life is too much
I'm just through
Where is your faith?
(Don't you give up dont you give in...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed
This for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
Your mind's slipping, wondering, "Is there really a God?"
Knowing you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But whenever there's pain, that feeling forever remains
We can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
And your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel that no one cares
Searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
Just know when you feeling that way His Spirit's in the room
And wonder why I ain't ever caught that feeling before
Maybe they know Him better, or I don't know no better
But what I do know, is that He's real and He lives forever
So the next time you feel like your world's about to end
I hope you studied because He's testing your faith again
I'd rather not live like there isn't a God
Than die and find out there really is
Think about it
Yeah
Mhm
Woo woo woo (she got some good head)
Woo woo woo  (K-Dot Valentino)
When I get up all in ya

So I can get some fame, about my pipe game
And slang my wee wee wee

Now they know who I are
Met this little bad bitch
She had all the Jordan shoes
Hair in a ponytail
I said no disrespect
Girl I want a sample
She said, “You don’t know me yet”
I said, “What that got to do with it”
One week or nine months I’m still gon’ hit it
Now admit it, you’re tempted, temptation is a motherfucker
Now let your guard down
I just wanna fuck you
I’m hard right now
She giggled and said, “I’m full of curiosity"
Walked in, put the rubber on, then I killed that
Hm hm
Her friend on the other end thinking how she gonna get a piece of him
Preach
When I get up all in ya
Tell your girlfriend I beat it up
So she can tell her friend I beat it up
And slang my wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Like a pornstar
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Now they know who I are
Yeah, it’s Ab-Soul
Used to fuck on my momma’s sofa
Them were the good old days but now a nigga older
Like a horny dog, nigga wet dreams and all
Waking up in cold sweat thinking bout them hoes, y’all
No holds barred I would go so hard
Sending bitches notes in class so much I hardly passed
Hoping she give me the mule yeah throw me that ass
I made her laugh
Maybe walk her home
Like Super Bowl Sunday
Call her on the phone
This was before text
Carson High we was on them chicks”
That’s a flip if you didn’t know
Let the homie hit though
Then she tell her girlfriend, then we let her join in
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
A nigga so goddamn stressed out
I feel like fuck everything right now
See I've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
See my pride is one thing I will not put aside
What? Uh
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
It seems like, you can't win for losing
Whatever you're doing turns out to be "what-are-you-doing?"
Nobody knows the position that you in
But it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
That feeling, hard to explain
When you just, just want to get away
Something like
You ever feel like nobody never understands you but you?
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
Nobody, nobody but you
So it feels like, like it's only you
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
Away from it all
Take me out of Hell where only Heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers, they won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the studio couch now, thinking bout my daughter
Times is getting harder, another beat is slaughtered
Just press record or, seems like I need a mill' to keep my shit in order
From my hat to my shoes, spirit laced with pride
Set some shit aside to help me wipe my teary eyes
Nothingness surrounding me, living my life
Though it's better to write
So how you feel? My nigga, I keep it real
So I'm feeling like I want to, I want to
I want to, I want to go so far from here
I need to, I need to
I need to, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
Poverty's paradise
(I've been hungry all my life)
Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart"
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
Akcuf’hum siht nrub uoy t'now ,erom on si htraE

I beat yo’ ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
Verse 2 says, "You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities."
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chastise you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
Shalom
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
(Ain't nobody prayin' for me)
(Ain't nobody prayin' for me)
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
(Nobody prayin' for me)
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
(Ain't nobody prayin' for me)
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin'
Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga, you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway
You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it
Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pit bull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
More divorce courts and portion
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
I'ma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king
Lyrics from Snippet 1
Hope my daughter isn't born with a piece of my heartbreak
And...
Lyrics from Snippet 2
...like Prince Rogers
I feel liberation is free, I feel I should diss the Oscars
...games
And I admit that I’m bad at talking myself out of shame
But who's to blame when the crowd start cheering and they passing dirty looks?
I now understand that I'll never be understood
Isolation didn’t work for me
Socializing didn't work for me
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
(Breathing)
What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (want you)
(I want you more than you know)
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, "You crazy?"
Roses are red, violets are blue
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
I said, "Where's Ricardo?"
You said, "Oh, no, not the show"
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible"
Get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (want you)
Registration is out of service
'Cause I (want you)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
When Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible"
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
Jesus take the wheel [inaudible]
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
Alls my life I has to fight, hittas
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "Yeah!"
Bad trips like, "Yeah!"
Nazareth, I'm on one
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty uh, uh is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say?
We been hurt, been down before
Hitta, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo' sho'
Hitta, I'm at the preacher's door
But we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
What you want, you a house, you a car?
A piano, a guitar?
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
I right my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Hitta, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Hitta, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo' sho'
Hitta, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Get back
Look I started from the bottom, at the very bottom
I was jibbing for a bottom, putting quarter pieces in the black caprice and make it holla (Alright)
No releasing me, I got the piece in me, I gotta
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
Inner-city bullet fly 'til that thing on auto pilot (Alright)
I don't really care about the care abouts
All I care about is wearing out your upper body
When I catch ya, when I catch ya, walking out your parents house
(Alright)
Fourteen years old sound so raw making plays home boy
Big K's and my big dogs
Never, ever, went straight home, boy
(Alright)
Abazaba
You know we get in the studio and do what we do best
Beautiful shit
But this time around I wanna do something different homeboy
You feel me my nig
Hop on them keys real quick my nig
(Hook)
Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
Yea hahaha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
(Verse 1: Kendrick)
Check me out
She tell me Kendrick put it down like this
When I listen I wanna close my eyes
And feel your lips
Let your lyrics wrap around me and grab my hips
So enticing
On point like the helmet of a Viking
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I could get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard
Composing myself, tryna remain content
Now she could talk about her boss and I can give advice
Or she could take the panties off and I could eat the (PIE PIE)
Fuck that, option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this tune
You know why?
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Hahaha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Aba, this shit my girlfriend'll like my nigga
Look
(Verse 2: Kendrick)
We be in the car, bumpin' my latest jam
I recorded at the studio around 10 p.m
It's a club banger
Catchy hooks and 808's
The first 8 bars, she's lovin' the track
Even rewinding it back
Soon as the beat drop
The way she react she like "That's Hot"
'Til I start talkin' bout how many hoes I got
How many I've misled just to get a nut
Like a squirrel, in pursuit of lunch
Uh
Though I'm on some cliché rapper shit
I know she thinking are my lyrics that accurate
She's so cool doe
Don't downplay her just to fuck up the mood yo
She'll still play it even though I sound rude yo
And disregards to the provocative records
One thing that I do know
This something my girlfriend'll like
Other hoes tonight
Soul
This something my girlfriend'll like too
This a great idea
This'll be my girlfriend's joint right here
So I'mma kick the shit she like
It seem right
Like a pair of jeans that fit tight
Around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
At the movies
Her body language gets read
Like a ruby
Cause she a work-a-art
No help from Julie
I'mma beast and she such a beauty
I love her, she know that, I place no one above her
Far from an arc, but best undercover
Like a iPod plugged to a USB
It's just you and me
I mean me and her
I mean her and I
It's plain to see, affirmative
So if you ever need me
You know where Herbert is
On her mind
Like she on mine
Uh
Play some shit my girlfriend'll like
Cause I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
She do music too, this shit my girlfriend'll write
If she was me talking bout her
DJ
Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
Now I'm sho' to get some cuddy
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, I'm tryna get blown
I'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my Cadillac Brougham
Looking for E.T. to phone home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminisce the good days
Thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the Rollie chains
Pro Club t-shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
That's fashion if you come where I'm from
Compton California, One love to the murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
But I don't trip, I still dip like salsa to a chip
Rolling down Rosecrans to scoop up my man, A-Mack
He talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
And so I scooped him round 3:30, Telling me it's all good
Tiger Woods, Now we looking for the birdy birdies
Stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
Pulled up on the breezies, Well what do you know? I think they love us
And this is for the homies
I'm talking bout the swap meets, Rollie
Chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
Baby tell the truth, yeah you know we got it going on
And if you feel good (hey)
Raise your hands high and throw up your hood (hey)
Represent the city like you know you should (hey)
I want to make sure that you understood we got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
(Is that right? Is that right?) We got it going on
As I continue my day, quite copacetic
Headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell
Had the right grub, I bail, need some gas
We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited we got 'em
Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy was two of my favorites
But anyway I'm steady coasting, smoking on that Hiroshima
Ashtray got a million roaches, I'm focussed but feeling good
The homies hanging on {?} and Monte Carlos
Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something nigga, break that fifty
I'm grabbing the city like I'm supposed to
Making my presence felt like Christmas day, what can I say?
Every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a G
If you can't relate then please have a seat
So, wherever you located, won't you let it be known
And put on for the soil of which you was grown
I put on like brand new Chuck Taylors
While giving you cuts like fresh tapers
I'm such a fool with it, go nuts
You bullshitting like Tuck, the bounce then untuck
Take 'em to school I must, this for the cool in us
Got me breathing with dragons
I crack the egg on you bastard
Why you step to the master
Like you sick with this
I really do this shit
You not equivalent to the Kdot the almighty
Watch this, I will body
Anybody in the crowd
You want me john gotti, couldn't see me
You peeping this is freestyle off top of the dome
I'll let you know why every other rapper need to go home
This a new verse, I put rappers in new hearse
I take rappers to new church
Who wanna see me, you first
Then him second, then you third
Nouns, my verbs
Battle these words
Nigga that shit is absurd
Troi Breeze:
OK if I'm 2nd or I'm 3rd
Whatever he just said you heard
But I'm coming through and I think that I got a new verse
I'm really tryna change the way that I've been livin' at home
I'm really doin' it
Nigga I be doin' this
Nigga I come through with this
Nigga I will do it and I swear I am so studious
Nigga I'm a student and I peeped the way you did it
Now I'm bout to do it off of the top of the fuckin' tip
If you bout to do off of the top, then fucking did it
If you say that you the best, then nigga won't you admit it
I see you got the waves in your hair i been there
Back in 8th grade, when the pussy i was scared
But now im seeing all kinds of woman in peripheral
This is individual, this here is a ritual
This here is spiritual
This is not rap , this is god body
Nigga this ain't nothing close to lyrical
Shit all I'm sayin now is I agree with you
Now I'm tryna do it like I was a seed and I grew up
And now I'm blessed like I just sneezed; hachew
I really appreciate it
I really appreciate you callin me up cause I'm out here and I'm ballin' it up
Taking the biggest shots, and now I been getting' it tryna spend the biggest knots
Cause I'm really out here tryna grind for my family
My brotha was from Piru
My pops was from what's he was raised out on Grape Street
Kendrick:
Well if ya brother was from Piru and your partna was from Watts
Then you should already know about them Compton blocks
All my niggas that's with me is from the city
All my niggas hold choppas and they be with me
And this is TDE this is stri-stri- strictly for my niggas and bitches tell me you with me
(crowd roar)
You see that scream right there, thats that scream that every other rapper scared
Thats that scream that every other clapper scared
If they did they would get bitch slapped like my nigga Snoop Dogg back in '94
This is Kurupt flow
This is the LBC shit
This the Compton DPGTDE shit
FUCK WITH ME SHIT
Troi Breeze:
My name is Troi Breeze
Kendrick:
Come on
And hopefully I found her
My nigga tells me 'bout this girl that he knows, oh
Said she the type of girl that I'm looking for, oh
Got straight to the point when she picked up the phone
When she picked up the phone she said hello and I said
A friend of mine said that you were the one for me
A friend of mine said that you was with everything
A friend of mine said that you are good company
Got good pussy baby
I want it baby
Gotta have it baby
Now girl I don't mean to come off so strong
But I heard that you got the love that I want
Can you promise me that it's true what they say?
Before you tell me your name? Is you with it?
A friend of mine said that you were the one for me
A friend of mine said that you was with everything
A friend of mine said that you got good pussy baby
Got good pussy baby
Can I sample baby? Cause I'm curious, curious
I want it baby
Said I need it baby cause I'm so curious, curious
{Bridge}
Tell me is you with it?
Is you with it? (4 times)
Tell me are you with it?
Are you with it? (4 more times)
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
That coochie, that twat, that pussy stuff
Whatever you wanna call it, I can't get enough
Be your number one or your ten
Baby yell dress, and just like UPS or FedEx girl we can both send
Then pray in the morning, then after we pray more play in the morning
I promise if we do it, I'll remain serene
I truly understand
Nobody gotta know like a group of yes men
So momma don't trip
So what it's gon' be miss lady my clock is tickin'
Are you gonna tell me now?
Or you need more time if you do that's fine
As long as it goes down, girl make up your mind
Quicker than a porno star, jump on my dick y'all
And get fucked by the millisecond
Duck when I pull the weapon from out of my mouth (Buh!)
Shots at you like a sawed-off
Aiming for your grill like I'm Paul Wall
Then peal 'til I not y'all
My cerebral cortex is like a war vet
Straight bananas, I never gave a fuck
'Bout anything but my momma, my daddy, siblings, and grandma
And if you neither one of them, then I gotta answer
Every question with a bullet hole in my hammer
Like VH1, that's far beyond your comprehension
Like a deaf person showing up to court for a hearing
Who they fearing? K. Dot
Tickle the nipples of women
Make your bitch grab her crotch when she hear my shit, bitch!
K. Dot got the unorthodox flow
Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals
Compton on my back like the titties of my masseuse
Pity, here you fool who?
Go against me, I rebuke thee
And wake thee up, six in the morning
Jump shot, coroners catch them on the rebound
Pans, pots, plates, bowls
I'm in your kitchen eating your stove
I'm hungry and hibernated
I'm cold as Miles Davis
It only gets more heinous, nigga I'm brainless
Like a blind bitch who don't suck dick
Dinosaur manure, big shit
Smell me or die quick, fucka!
(jab, jab, jab, left right)
I can stand in a pool of gasoline lighting a blunt and never catch on fire
(How come?) Silly motherfucker, I'm fire
Smack the devil over the cheek, gave him a third degree burn
Iced it down when he was asleep, and said you'll be okay
A lot of rappers are desperate to be a star by the day
I'm just saying, I feel I'm the one
Like a magician with a stick inside his hand, or the name of a mexican
I gets ignorant with ya
Snap me a picture, bitch, I'm famous
I came in this world nuts in my palm and drinking Paul Masson
Locked him in a basement and amputated his shooting arm
Like a fifty mile strip when I'm pimping these hoes
(ee)
(K. Dot got the unorthodox flow
On fire, make a rapper burn his soul
Murder for hire, acquire choirs for funerals)
(Look, ee)
I remember, being young, dumb, looking for the next thrill
Angry adolescents, three things on our minds
Money, murder and you
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem)
Bring yo' girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it
Picture perfect, uh huh
And I paint a perfect picture, my intention's to get richer
But I ain't tryna split the profit with ya
Every pocket on me bleeds, I'm a selfish ass nigga
Mmm, deuces up, black coupes is us (Uh, huh)
Head all in the bathroom
Beg for it, I'll be back soon
Fuckin' problem, fuck your problems
I got five phones for five different reasons
London, Tasha, Mya, Keisha
Courtney, blue-eyed devils with no Visas
Overseas, high heels, wine and pizza
Overdosed on bad bitches, I swear
One on both arm but need two pair, I beast
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem)
Bring yo' girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it
Yeah ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz-is-to-Me-Just-a-Car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya, beast
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And, yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
(If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem)
Bring yo' girls to the crib, maybe we could solve it
Gather around. I'm glad everybody came out tonight. As we stand on our neighborhood corner, know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have. Listen, Keisha, Tammy, come up front. I recognize all of you. Every creed and color. With that being said... fuck your ethnicity. You understand that? We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you. All of you...
Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
Everybody can't drive Benz's, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut! Man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God cause I got my sins up
Matter of fact, don't mistake me for no fucking rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind the fucking cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it, I'm out of my mind
So don't you mind how much the cost is, penny for my thoughts
Yeah man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Going postal, never freeze up, when I approach you
HiiiPower
Reporting live from Planet Terminator X
I saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47
Now I don't give a fuck if you
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
I'm tired of y'all, cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I was kicking that math, dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I be kicking that ass, lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate my dreams, get it right
Get a life, I got two, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man I'm fly, put wings on my back
That a plane or an angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa... gross
I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you
And the power in the people and if they don't believe us
They'll die
Wizard
Now I don't give a fuck if you
Black, White, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
Heard a conversation with my father talking to his favorite partner
At the domino table, Tony had told him that he saw a
Young nigga hopping out busting like four charters
Popping pills, mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Mix a gallon of sherm and some holy water
Sell it to a priest he probably can get it off by tomorrow
It's wicked when my favorite uncle kick it
Phantoms ain't the only thing that suicidal
Open the doorway to his soul
Hit the hallway then hit the closet you see a rifle
Aim it at your arteries, pardon me, parts of me is pyscho
In retrospect my respect was a power ranger high note
Tumbling backwards into a karate kicking high note
Surrenduring Ninja Turtles, pizza and Sega Genesis
Something my papa said that caught my attention
He said I'm seven going on sixty-seven
The day I turned seventeen is the day that a lesson inside my lifetime
Come across a clothes line, every stick is a co-sign
Everything in the streets got the power to make me go blind
Even if he sat me down in the sun and gave me those eyes
Comprehend it well and I could smell the soberness evaporating by itself
He said, "Tony my biggest fear is to hear Kendrick disappeared in the fire out here and I didn't help
So if I can give him the game to hydroplane his decisions in life so he can go
Sacrifice my life even if that shit, my mama though
Til the day he carried by the big six, domino
Don't get your cap peeled by the black menace
K Dot Thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier
On point like a pyramid, force to be reckoned with
With the best shit
Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are
This is it
I'm in the lab cooking up all day, eff em up all day
Like a nympho, I been dope since s curl waves
Trying to convince hoes I got good hair
Knowing damn well there's chemicals there
I'm in the hood with the 17 year olds that's on hood patrol
Any moment you can lose your life so kiss your kids or hug your wife or whatnot yo
I spawned with a dragon
Came out the battle laughing
I smack em 'til their nose is running
You know the hoes is coming if I'm there
And the hoes is cumming once we hit that hotel
That's no assumption, cool out before I move out
Hop on the 105 and do about 105 before your ass get threw out
The back seat
There's a dead guy on the freeway, oh it's not Dot
Tell the medics it's okay, a beast when the beat break
But to me it's a throw away
Nice enough, I throw a spear at Nas, a jab at Jay
Matter fact, no, I take that back
See I don't play with real legends of rap like you do
And I'm crucial, concealed by real Crips and Soowoos
And they shoot, they photography students when beef get to brewing Compton!
When I jumped off the porch
I was forced into last resorts of a temper gone short
I was hoarse from yelling out
Demons that fought inside of me taught society how to rejoice
A good kid in a mad city, slightly annoyed
Pellets that's tumblin' straight at my melon, apparent reason
Probably was because of my cousin cuzzin’ a blood
That was bloodin' in public
And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't no kin to me, 'stead of Kendrick, I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, sure that's your remedy
Fair enough, I got enemies but I don't bang
But that's the repercussions like
When your cousin is cuzzin’ a blood
Then you’re by yourself at the Compton parade, he said:
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (Pump, pump)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I do my stuff (Pump)
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Like on the ground, you know the sound
Sympathetic 'cause they like seeing you
Tryna fight back at a pack of piranhas
I promised three of ’em, beat the black off my back
And pajamas was almost needed
I should've went to sleep and seen some sheep
When I greeted the pavement
Got up and seen the shock on their faces
My luck in the palm of a cherry bomb
And they waitin' to blow up on me
Then I heard someone's firearm
Make a sound like it waved around my direction
Expected to drop in a second, look at the faults
I've made in the shortest amount of time
And in back of my mind I'm like "this the loss I'ma take"
My fate was distraught
I'm probably pushing up daisies
Before I can make my way to the car
Cross cancel and right before I seen
The black glove raisin' the handle, he said:
Aye, look, homie, I gang-bang (Pump, pump)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, tho (Pump, pump)
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Bitch, I'm bustin' back, I'ma borrow my uncle's strap in a minute
Jump in a Civic then wear that bitch on my lap
I was timid but now I'm tempted
And tenants alert me on where you at
I'm a menace when I'm offended, relentless, I will react
Then somebody said the dispatch
That's a fact when you're black and undeveloped
You're profiled as a felon
I'm bellin' down Boulevards with my basketball and a backpack
Gym shoes and my nap sack
Hair nappy, my ball cap backwards
And then I look back, strobe lights on my tail pipe
Turned left then I turned right
Turned deaf 'cause the sirens is loud
Pray to God I don't get sniped
Pray to God that the sunlight stay shining for 30 more minutes
Hope that a witness around when I'm 'bout to cut off the engine
Even though being a criminal ain't my memo
But this is what he said when I dropped the window:
And if you is or ain't, I still need to know
Where you from, where you stay or where your grandma stay
Can I pay my past a visit?
Centennial Compton School District
And video campus shut the fuck up your premises
King Drew and Westchester had the baddest bitches
And my nigga L Wood had a white Toyota, and we got pulled over
And everybody had know that
My nigga Yan Yan had all the red P Hat
Which was really dumb because where we was at
Was the other side and more than likely
The other side really didn't like that
Didn't have no burner so if they shot us we could never really shoot back
That the black car didn't pull up and ask where yall niggas from
I know some, nigga less fortunate was fucking with the enemies' bitch
She had a fat ass and a brown Camaro but it wasn't that fast it was like a V6
But anyways she was one of those hoes in highschool with the cornrows
Well she's important, well she wasn't, she was just so and so so and so cousin
He was a red, so anytime she got into it, that who she would get
Now let me get back to the plan
Homie had ask, " Do ya got a man?"
Where do you stay?" She said, " Rosecrans"
He said, "What? you're a, you're a little freaky bitch huh?"
I can work that pussy and the tongue
If you come over I can make you cum
Because I like to get to drunk."
Notice that he was out of bounds
Oldies playing in the background
Let's get it on Marvin Gaye had bumped to the morning
Time to go, picked his pants up off the floor
When he walked out he seen a four four Bluh!
Didn't know that was the pussy he was dealing with
And that's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
That's how you get your ass killed bitch!
Fucking with them hoes, them hoes, them hoes, them hoes
Them hoes hoes will have you uh dead dead dead
Look. I guess we all can learn from mistakes
But your first mistake, might be your death date
And death doesn't wait, on no one
A million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one
If you not aware of the rules or maybe tryna fill someone else shoes
Like a square trying to be a gangster kind of remind of this one dude
He wasn't thirteen he was twenty two
When he went to first get put on the hood
But usually this type of person want to prove his s s s s self on purpose
Tell everybody quit working, but really he's worthless
His momma had money, his daddy had money, so he had money
The OG's that gave him a pistol, think that he was gonna be just another crash dummy
And the funny thing about it he thought he was bout it like P-Miller
But he wasn't no killa
Just a monkey hanging around a bunch of gorillas
Everybody wanna be tough guy so he did, approached this guy like, "Where are you from?" with his gun but didn't shoot it, rule number one
Even though the dude didn't banged the very next day he seen around the way blew his brains out while homeboy was cruising
Not knowing the scariest nigga will split your shit
And that's how he got his ass killed bitch!
That's how he got his ass killed bitch!
Fuck around and get your ass killed bitch! How?
Not knowing the G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, the codes the codes
The G codes, if you don't know then your already dead dead dead
Feel me?

So get adapt to the case loads of crack
The yayo, the smack
And turn that ho into tomatoes or plants
And yeah I smoke back to back to back
Like I’m on two tracks but you ain't feeling that
I got my dogs with me lookin out for silly cats
Weezy where the city at
And If I fall stay up
Cuz I’ma get it back
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Aye, Fresh, just hit me with that
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Play me in my head, play me in my head)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
(Cause I'ma kill 'em with the flow, I'ma kill 'em with the flow)
People always tell me I'm heavy I say believe that
But I don't get all full off the feedback
Kick door, hands high or get your knees blacked
If I don't take everything I'ma be back
And I'm stickin to my word like bees wax
He acts an asshole for these stacks
Few leaves left the sole tree standing
I’m in too deep, my roots go deeper than the spot
Where their bodies shouldn’t sleep
But it be like that
Never let a nigga with a knife see my back
I’m outta here
Let me see my hat
And I rock it so low I can’t see where I’m at
This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Aye, Fresh, just hit me with that
(Play me in my head, play me in my head)
Fresh just hit me with that (He hit me in my face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But can you bless me with that (Bless me in my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Take that shit off at the front
Gudda! Lord
Uh-oh
No one's defiant as me
I know my worth, so when you pay me
Just know that I am not cheap (I am not cheap)
On the road to riches
Rippin' this shit to pieces
No, I will not look out for the beat
Started out on the block
Got on my feet and rose to the top
I'm the cleanup man with the mop
50 shots disfigured his top, yes (disfigured)
I walk around in the city like God (God)
Somebody, please tell me, what are the odds?
On this mic I am a wizard, but this is not Oz
Cold but hot, I can turn the summer to fall
I'm sicker than y'all
I'm buyin' some acres, no time for a neighbor
I'm from New Orleans, yes, I am a gator
I’ll do you a favor, and not do you a favor
'Cause if I do you a favor
I'ma have to lay hands on you
Like I'm givin' you prayer
Eastside, we ain't playin' it fair
You ever heard of the tortoise and hare?
I'm switchin' the gear
Nigga, I'm here
Gudda!
(Blows smoke)
I got my married hoes on single drugs
Got my fattest hoes gettin' finger fucked
And my trashiest hoes is clean as fuck
Take your shoes off before you walk inside
Take your shoes off before you cross the line
I snoozed off on Father Time
Got my goons to go kidnap Daughter Time
Got one gun that shoot for seven minutes
I'm done shitting, niggas never spit it
I'm high class, niggas' elementary
I'm a Hot Boy under air conditionin'
Shoot the gun with the left arm limpin'
George Jefferson in all seven minutes
Got a hot girl off television
With a very sticky unhairy kitty
In the right position, screamin' "You're consistent"
I sit there and listen like we talkin' business
I don't need her out here filmin' niggas
I'd really rather have her steal from niggas
Kush loud as Fred screamin' "Wilma!", nigga
I've been takin' time out to count the bands
Break a promise in the promised land
From the middleman to the Macho Man
I've been talkin' shit up in Diddy house
Went to Disneyland, talked to Mickey Mouse
Then I figured out how to figure out
What I was figurin' out, you figure it out
Got a trigger man with an extra hand
Sky is the limit, head in the clouds
While you runnin' round, I'ma run it up
You dumb it down, I ain't dumb enough
I hit the courtroom and stunk it up
High comin' down, plug comin' up
You gon' hold me down, you gon' hold me up
You don't know me, but you know what's up
And the coke was cut with some extra coke
She don't know it's love, it's not important love
As long as we can keep extortin' the plug
Just let him be and ignore the buzz
Pour it up, catch a sugar rush
Chopper full of rust, but it still bust
Like a hundred holes, got a hole-in-one
Safe full as fuck, money full of dust
And I'm pulling up in that "What the fuck?"
If you look enough, you a mussel, punk
That's a Bugatti on steroids
Bugatti on Chevron
All-white like an Altoid
From the Teflon to the Kevlar
Don't mean shit when your head off
Make the top dog jump dead off
Then we keep his head for a memoir
I sped off with the head off
Goin' big Bruno on Mars
Sippin' Lone Star, turn a pornstar
To a known star with a phone call
Purple, purple rivers, yeah
I've been poppin' 10s, yeah
'Cause my bitch pop all the 20s, damn
I met Satan, he was chillin', hold up
Murky, murky water
Floatin' purple ribbons
I'm cursed but still religious
Take your clothes off bitch
Call your road dog, bitch
I feel like O-Dog, bitch
Boyz 2 Menace

Yeah, uh-huh
Come on, yep
Mmmhmm, bells

Let's go
Riding 'round the city
With some brand new heat
Brand new car
Brand new seats
Brand new smell
Put out the roach
Light a brand new L
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new
My shirt brand new
Fuck you bitch
My shoes brand new
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new
Yeah
I'm cold like a midnight
I am the President
And the assassin
Cameras on
Welcome to the show
I am the main attraction
Money in the attic
Money on my mind
Money is my habit
Stay on the grind
Until money's automatic
Bitch, I love money
I'm a fucking fanatic
Always strapped, gripped-tight, graspin'
Say what? Who, me? (Click-clack) Blast 'em
Chrome 24's, tires thin like napkins
Got to ride big 'cause I am like a captain
Probably in my office, doing my taxes
And I don't even have time to practice
Riding 'round the city
With some brand new heat
Brand new car
Brand new feet
Brand new seats
Brand new smell
Put out the roach
Fuck you bitch
Fuck you bitch
My shirt brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch
My shoes brand new (them too)
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new (yeah)
Ice
Ridiculous price
Hm, I'm fishin', and the bitches will bite
Right
And if she doesn't wear panties then I fuck her on sight
I'm nasty like spice
I know what she likes
I can make a black woman
Scream like she white
I can make a white woman
Scream like Mike
But before she starts singin'
She got to check my mic
Niggas just hatin'
And I done lost sight
It's like I don't see 'em
I only see the light
Talking that shit
But you boys just hype
Louis V tennis shoes
Big brown stripe
Shit, nigga – I'm ripe
Riding 'round the city
With some brand new heat
Brand new car
Brand new seats
Light a brand new L
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new (brand new)
My shirt brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch
My shoes brand new (them too)
Fuck you bitch
OK
Brand new coupe
Driving crazy than a mother
With the burner sittin' under
Got my tank top, top down
It probably ain't summer
Damn, there's no keeping up with the brother man
I could spell my name in burnt rubber
I'm gone!  Leave me alone
Now the dog is at supper
You could wash my plate and put it back in the cupboard
Ahem, I'm so far ahead of them suckers
I'mma have to start rappin' in numbers
They come rapid like thunder
Riding 'round the city
With some brand new heat
Brand new seats
Brand new smell
Light a brand new L
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch
My shirt brand new (brand new)
Fuck you bitch
My shoes brand new (them too)
Fuck you bitch
I'm actin' brand new (yeah)
We had them bitches addicted like it was some drug
Weezy, Fresh, and Unplugged
Give me a big fine bitch in a dress, one who put them lips in effect
Suck the dick until the shit in her chest
You can piss on her breast, I like that shit
Project hoes like that dick, don't bite that dick
Really don't care how (?) shorty
Give me head, don't care, swallow cum, don't spit
White girls I video tape 'em and they enjoy it
They love it when everybody saw it, it's off the chain
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brains
But watch them hoes that want the change, it's not a game
Or a short cuban ho, with a fat ass though
Bet I'll treat the bitch just like Fidel Castro
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
Listen, listen, it's Weezy the hottest, drinkin Barcadis
I stream through the scene in a Lincoln on Robbers
Later on I'm tryin to climb behind ya spine
Hold up lil mama, slow ya ass down
Pick ya up, dick up in ya, throw ya ass down
Now throw ya ass around, and scream my name
I can't hear you say it louder what (Wayne, Wayne)
A damn shame, better watch that boy he nasty
I strap on de plastic, make ya bounce like elastic
I like a short thick broad, fat ass and shit
Matter of fact when I see her, +Pull+ her +Over+ like a cop
Juvey coulda "Backed It Up" and I'da "Dropped it Like It's Hot"
Ya heard me?! (What, haha)
Haha, Unplugged
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
I like them big and round, pretty and brown
A bitch that take it from the back and make the (Ugh Ugh) sound
Now you can bounce slide drop, giddy up, giddy up
Now you can ride til you feel it get a nut, get a nut
Shake for ya hood, bounce for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that nigga got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the KY, hold up, pause
My bitch got thongs, yo' bitch got drawers
My chick like to swallow, yo' chick like to spit
If yo' chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch
My ginseng, viagra, and a strawberry pop
From vagina to the asshole do it again
I want a yucky down misses bout delta
Yo mama loved a Tymer but now you welcome
You ok lil mama and I love that chick
But deep down inside I just love my dick
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
(Bangladesh)
No Ceilings, motherfucker
Nice tires on the 'Ghini, you should wanna king me
Brain dead flow, vegetable, zucchini
I live on the beach, she walk around in her bikini
I’m here to distinguish the bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap, get some money in between it
This beat getting totalled, Pam, Keisha, Kima
Sitting on the world, thinking 'bout a girl
Pistol on my side, paint you like a mural
Digged in my pocket, pulled out a party
Be cool 'fore you get stomped and pulled out the party
Hollygrove shit, I'm on my Hollygrove shit
Looking for a bad bitch, I give her dinosaur dick
Big, bad flow Weezy, fuck the polices
Elevator in my crib 'cause it's five floors
I'm not expecting you to have one inside yours
Vince Young, suicide doors
Life’s a bitch, now die for her
I have the type of flow niggas don’t have to like
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don’t have to write
(Oh you ain't know?)
The way I’m eating niggas wish they had my appetite
Straight up out of Texas and I’m major like Applewhite
I pour four then I hit the exit door ('Bout to)
Take a trip to Macy’s cop the whole second floor (Gimme that)
Whores smell the scent of money coming out my pores (Smell it?)
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue, boy (Haha)
I made it from a flyer to the Forbes (See me?)
Young Elvis Freshley, yes he flyer than the stork (Damn)
Dropping babies off in your chick's cheek (Ugh), kicks neat (Fresh)
Got your son looking up to me like I’m 6 feet (Haha)
Your daughter need someone to save her (What?), not me (Nah)
I’m knocking hoes down like Laila (Who?) Ali (Yeah)
Yeah, it’s No Ceilings, like a coliseum (No Ceilings)
Flow harder than an anvil, Short
OK, it's Gudda, ho! All about my Bills like Buffalo
Purple got me moving slow, like I’m in a snail race
Pop-pop-pop, 3 shots to the head then I pick up my shell case
Leave 'em with a pale face, yes, I am a young money goon
I do her somethin' rude, I pop her like balloons
I pass her off to Millz, then drop her off to Tune
This is No Ceilings bitch, roofless like a stadium
We shut down every fucking spot these bitches see us in
You want us in your club? Well, nigga, pay us then
All-grey BM, I’m getting it for my Baby M
She told me get the money and count it for me when I rake it in
G-U-D-D-A, propane flow
*Lyrics from Snippets*
Yeah, bricks on the knee, huh
Tryna shoot up [?]
Put a nigga six underneath
Put-
Cats, snakes, chickens, ducks, elderly people, and twerkers
I presents to you
Fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh, fre, fre, fresh
DJ Mannie Fresh, fresh, fre, fresh
Mannie Fresh, fre, fresh
DJ Mannie Fre, fre, fresh, young ladies
Put ya hands on ya knees and bend ya rump
Put ya back in, back out, do the hump
Well, I'm fly as a son of gun, son of a stunna
Yeah, high as a 757 going to heaven
I'm the god, 1-7, Apple and E
I'm the Cash Money Makaveli, y'all ain't ready
Quick, fast like Tom Petty, y'all just petty
'82, I was born ready, I'm too ready
Y'all Betty Crocker baller blockers, I'm too heavy
Meatball, Lamborghini, top spaghetti
I don't need no pool, I'm swimming in you
In the Beamer, eight hundred forty, mama, shake something for me
And it don't make sense if it don't make that money
I'mma take that money, I'm straight Cash Money
Whodi, I bring it back, whodettes, to the bottom of the maps
I take off my brim
Moment of silence for the homeboy Soulja Slim
Fronting 'round here will get ya back chopped off
We do our own thing, we don't act like y'all
I say, black white walls with the back swiped off
Y'all lil bustas just a tax write-off
I'm a stand up guy, not the type that fall
We don't breed them kind, but they bleed just fine
If ya can't, boy, read my nine
I'm going hard in the paint like Diesel time
Either I'm the illest cat doing it or these cats is losing it
I be easy, fall back and be cool with it
Pallbearer is moving his dead flow, I'm through with it
I'm the sh--naw, naw, I'm sewer-rich
Weezy F Baby, I do's this
An old school gangsta, mack like the 80s
I look like Cita and act like Baby
You play with me, I react like the navy
Yeah, and your head is a bleeping target
You don't want me to see you with my peeping Tommys
Wizzle Fizzle, I keep in New Orleans
A country boy in something foreign
'Bout a hundred thousand more than what you're in
You're not 'bout it, you freeze up like popsicles
Pop up on bicycles, pop y'all like spot pimples
Wizzle Fizzle, original Hot Bizzle
Still Lil Wayne, but the dividend's not little
Don't be surprised how the crown fit him
All brown paper bag (Uh-Oh)
All brown paper bag -Fill it up wit' ones (Like Father, Like Son biatch!)
All brown paper bag - Fill it up wit' ones (Angel on the beat)
Fill it - Fill it up wit' ones (I tell 'em I tell 'em)
Big choppa I can hit you from a hundred foots
Wha's happenin' Wardy? How you want it, buddy?
I am the president, you just play your position
And I hope that door don't hit ya, get up outta my office crawfish
Don't let them sharkys get ya, this beat's a car collision
Mercedes wit' them kidneys, naw that's a Benzo
I don't pop them pills no, but I pop them rubber bands
Man I can get like fifty thousand in that brown bag
Yea, nigga
Cook a whole, make it out a whole and a half bitch!
Yea, Birdman in a Benz wit' the duffel stuffed
Them people hot around my way but we don't give a fuck
We on the grind for the shine tryin' to come up
A black MAC, black 6, and a black Hummer
Them thirteen hundreds, fourteen hundreds, we be gettin' money
Drop it off, get to work nigga keep it runnin'
Garbage bag full of cash nigga keep it comin'
In my hood Red Phantom nigga we be stuntin'
Got the block blocked off nigga we be hustlin'
Brown duffel bag filled up with cash
Get it up, in the air
Now money cars clothes hoes, all a nigga know so
All brown paper bag, I could fill it up with ones
Nigga fill it up with ones, hey, fill it up with ones
I think that she's a stripper, dancer, dancer, dancer
Dancer, hey hey stuff it in the thang dog
Damn right I be poppin' my collar
In a all black Impala makin' fiends wanna holla
Got the suade on my headrest, gold on my damn bracelet
Hey, triple gold nigga, sucka, I ain't ridin' thin
You want me come and get me
I'm in 360 (Ferrari, man) Cash Money's with me
Microphone check, I still don't hear my...
Oh yeah I do, yeah I do
Who the fuck is Stevie J?
Don't be lookin' for no donations
I get pussy then hibernation
I start humpin' soon as I wake up
He woke up bleedin' like "who shot me?"
I kept shootin'; Boo said "you got 'em"
Now, all we gotta do is get rid of the body
But anyway I woke up in some new punani
I was drunk as a bitch, drunk as a bitch
But not drunk as that bitch
I got in that shit acted donkey in it
Junk in her trunk, hope my trunk key can fit
Then she jumped on my dick like a monkey and shit
Monkey see monkey do, banana clips
Shoot at them niggas, no camera glitch
Wax that ass, no candle stick
And I run with some killers I eat with the mob
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high
Look dead in my eyes, see death in my eyes
The TEC on my thigh and my aim so good
I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye
A nigga almost died but I'm outchea
Fuck around with a real nigga get murked
I been paid my dues will I get reimbursed?
Love it when she make faces
Pussy feel like vacation
Eat it like I'm dyin' of starvation
Give her to Fuke if she Caucasian
My niggas wild as Jumanji
You can call me an S.O.B
Cause its skateboards over bugattis
I used to be at them Heat games
With better seats than Pat Riley
Pop that Ollie, Tunechi
Met her tonight, fuck her today
You tuck her away, I'm fuckin' her face
Wine head, she's guzzling grapes
Back shots, I'm holding her waist
You know Tune my bro, but he ain't tryna meet ya
Just bring your friend, both of us'll eat her
Hater niggas be hungry
Got a hundred shots to feed 'em
Her panties are down, her legs is up
We finally fucked, she starved for months
Don't give a fuck, still I'll hit
Never no feelings, no love for these hoes
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls
No flowers, we're simple, we fucked in the Rolls
Royce - trick!
Now they mad, I told they was
Bitches'll be lying, I did the same
Far from a square, don't mistake me for lame
She tell me keep goin', I'm doin' my thing
I'm giving her hundreds, she's keeping my change
Most women front, but who do you blame?
I gave you dick, you gave me pussy
Bitch!
You know niggas still on probation
I get higher than expectations
You know this is the Dedication
I'm on that kush she on that molly
Shout out my nigga Luca Brasi
I don't know this ho
So I must dash, no disguises
Tunechi, I had to Dedication 5 it
Tunechi
Barbie
I been smokin' gas, killin' bitches
Cover up my face like a ninja
In this Alexander Wang scarf
I'ma drop a bag, they gon' pull up
And then they gon' let them things off
I ain't switchin' up my hairstyle
But my niggas let it bang off
Me and Weezy in LIV
You was tryin' too hard
Me and Tunechi winnin' though
I am on my pivot though, I am just so pivotal
Bands, I go get it though, Weezy on his pedestal
A lot of gang shit, a whole lot of gang shit
All these plaques is pilin' up, it's nowhere to hang shit
These bitches pussy though
Pushed them out my pussy though
Niggas want my cookie though
'Cause it taste like cookie dough
Smoke, I got a free pack; flow sick, get a Z-pak
Niggas don't mean my race when they say "She blacked"
Bitch get on your kneecap, I don't mean C. Kaep'
I'll get you checked, pussy; I'll get you a free pap
You bitches don't ball out, you get your QB sacked
I'm OBJ, hoes; break records like ankles
Tell 'em carry on, they gon' miss me when I'm gone
I'm gone
Got 'em feelin' like they five star, yeah
Your hoes throwin' fits, my bitches patient
Man, I feel just like a doctor, yeah
She start cryin' and said her job hard, yeah
Switch her whip out, put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest In Peace to Honda
Cocaine on her navel, lick it so my tongue can go HAM
Put my face up in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Make her do the jumpman, ayy
A fly yellow bone to me, I told her to come get a tan
Now she butter pecan
A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga
And I wake up, smell the Folgers, I don't know how I woke up
'Cause I was in a coma, but now I'm in the moment
Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'
The plug ain't charge me nothin' for it
I cried tears of fuckin' joy
LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Ne-Yo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And the Nina came, and her sister came
And what's her name, it’ll go Buka Bang
You don't even know where to put the blame, that's cold
I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
Got 'em feelin' like they five star
Your hoes throwin' fits, my bitches patient
Man, I feel just like a doctor
She start cryin' and said her job hard
Switch her whip out, put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Honda
Switch her whip out put her in a Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Mazda
Put her ass up in a dumb Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Smart Car
Switch her, put her in Mercedes
Now she screamin' Rest in Peace to Kia
Microphone check, I still don't hear my...
Oh yeah I do, yeah I do
Who the fuck is Stevie J?
You get dick, then reservations
I get pussy then hibernation
I woke up in some new punani
He woke up bleedin' like "who shot me?"
I kept shootin' Boo said "you got 'em"
Now all we gotta do is get rid of the body
But anyway I woke up in some new punani
I was drunk as a bitch, drunk as a bitch
But not drunk as that bitch
I got in that shit acted donkey in it
Then she jumped on my dick like a monkey and shit
Monkey see monkey do, banana clips
Shoot at them niggas, no camera glitch
Wax that ass, no candles lit
And I run with some killers I eat with the mob
Got some shit built up I keep it inside
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high
Look dead in my eyes, see death in my eyes
I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye
Hold up, all bullshit aside
A nigga almost died but I'm outchea
I been paid my dues will I get reimbursed?
Love it when she make faces
I'm at the finish line, her heart racin'
Give her to Fuke, if she caucasion
My niggas wild as Jumanji
You can call me an S.O.B
Cause its skateboards over bugattis
Don't stop, pop that don't stop
Sippin' on dumb, puffin' a J
Met her tonight, fuck her today
You tuck her away, I'm fuckin' her face
Back shots, I'm holding her waist
Freaky, I always freak...
You know Tune my bro, but he ain't tryna meet ya
Just bring your friend, both of us'll eat her
Got a hundred shots to feed 'em
Her panties are down, her legs is up
We finally fucked, she starved for months
Don't give a fuck, still I'll hit
Never no feelings, no love for these hoes
No flowers, were sent, but we fucked in the Rolls
Bitches'll be lying, I did the same
Far from a square, don't mistake me for lame
She's suckin' me off, I'm pokin' her brain
She tell me keep goin', I'm doin' my thing
That pussy so wet, I'm calling it rain
I'm giving her hundreds, she's keeping my change
I keep it a hundred, you do the same
I gave you dick, you gave me pussy
It's safe to say it's an even exchange... bitch!
Don't be givin' out information
You know niggas still on probation

I turn that pussy to Dasani
Shout out my nigga Luca Brasi
I don't know this ho
So I must dash, no disguises
Tunechi, I had to Dedication 5 it
Hammer on the dresser, work on the stove
I'm sitting on the counter blowing purp out my nose
Red bone naked, in the bed flexin'
I say bitch I ain't impressed you must've got the wrong impression
Man, we living in hell like a deep breath
Real niggas with real money, real bitches with fake asses
If she don't wanna fuck I get on my skateboard and I skate passed her
Money on the table, guns on the table
Bitch I'm on that syrup tell that ho leggo my Eggo
And my girlfriend is a choppa, I finger fuck that ho
Hello I am Tunechi: you had me at hello

In that boxing ring

Niggas done fled from-a...
If him wan' play, busta,...
...come make me dead, busta
Beanie'-a half-way out my nappy head
But I don't care - I just grab my clip, slap and spray
Anywhere - it don't matter where a nigga stay
Just believe me when I say, "Guerrilla warfare"
I swear, it be some more drama about these bags
Niggas in black drive Jags - camouflage rags
Niggas' domes get bust wide open with blood and sweat
Niggas ridin' off in Hummers - laughin', drinkin' Moette
You know me: Corlleon, standin' four feet
I'm to-tin' cannons, wearin' Rolies
See, these lil' boys, they ain't really up on my game
But once I run into that nigga playin' with Wayne, man
See, when I spin-a you bend then I be on you block
But when me jump out with the chop-chop, my nogga, you drop
Now where your niggas at, comradie? They not with you now
I guess they heard that when I'm ridin' I make the crew stop
Now, is you 'bout what I'm 'bout?
If you 'bout what I'm 'bout, you 'bout drama
Thuggin' in broad day with four Glocks, a knife, and a chopper
I'm runnin' away, don't get in my way
Caller callin' me killer!
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My niggy, when I'm out late call me what you want
Full of blunts
Them callin' me killer
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My niggy, when I'm out late call me what you want
Full of blunts
Now as the heat flame up
Them lookin'-a down the street, them think they see Wayne truck
Him whole block don't scare me cause me get me thing and bust
Now U.P.T. come down - chopper city in the ghetto, my man
Now who that be in the car with the chopper? Oh, it's Lil' Wayne
Give me that rag, you ain't no soldier - wipe the blood off my chain
Gettin' blisty...
...off in a black F-150
'Bout to do the old usual - hit your block, just spittin'
Heads spinnin' like a set of seventeens or somethin'
Because-them
(-Hook [Lil Wayne])
Original Hot Boy - land-cruisin' with guns
I shall be the one who burn the block up
Never miss when I distribute anger up out my Cali'
Hundred shots automatic
Leave ya hopeless in the alley
If the nigga love his life he would have his guns up
...and got boys that got toys to stop noise
See, when me ride off in the Hummer, leave him set empty
Now him catch three cause him want beef
Now, me tried to tell the stupid boy, "Don't mess-a with me."
Now look at him - open up his casket and see
Click-clack my mack, twist my Philly cap to the back
Jump in the black and scream "war", and just "pow! pow!"
How you love me now?  With five barrels to your eye
What the dillio? Fill a four-four clip
You'll get flipped for runnin' off at the lip
Who behind the gun flame?...
It's Mis-ter Wayne
-Me!

Huh?

What?

Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga

Killer!
Howdy do motherfuckas, it's Weezy Baby
I leave you missing like the fucking O'bannons
That's the AK-47, make his neighborhood love me
Don't make that bird shit, he got a weak stomach
Niggas know I'm sick, I don't spit, I vomit, got it?
Simon says: "shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg"
These other niggas dope, I'm wet crack baby
Yes, get back, get back boy, this a setback
Clumsy ass niggas slip and fall into a debt trap
Them boys pussy, born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet em up, I hope he got his towel on
I aim at your moon and get my howl on
And when it come to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet or put some money on ya head
Life ain't cheap, you better off dead if you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga Fee
See every motherfucka at the door don't get a key
You're outside looking in, so tell me what you see
It's about money, it's bigger than me
I tell my homies: "don't kill him, bring the nigga to me"
Yeah, don't miss, you fucking with the hitman
Kidnap a nigga, make him feel like a kid again
Straight up, I ain't got no conversation for you

From Philly to where I'm landing I'm a (Cannon)
And I'm on that Philly fighting shit and I come fully equipped
You trolley, get bodied, keep nina and shotty in the whip
If a nigga try to stick me I'mma blam him
Sing along now, di-di-dadi, I'm Free, got the butters
Got the green, he got the tan, got the whole enchilada
Owe me dough, I'm inside of ya house, tie up ya brother
Make the prick call up ya mother, she might know where to find you
I am on top of my job, the heavyweight champ of the flowers
Flow like the ocean, open water, ya drowning, I will
Sharks surround him and eat him, nice to know him, I will
Roll over your squad like I'm "One Punch" Carr
Take control of your soldiers, you won't miss 'em
I make it hard for rap niggas, I'm peer pressure
Matter of fact I'm motivation to rap better
I showed niggas how to act, how to dress better
I stay fresh, more fitted caps than bad catchers
I'm the crack, the smack, the gun, the rule
The gat, the strap, the gun, the tool
The motherfucking (Cannon)
Other words, I'm the real, for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill
The deal is sealed, niggas ain't real as Will, 'cause I'm a (Cannon)
And I handle well, pedal like Cannondale
And I got the 50-cal mag, its a handheld (Cannon)
I'm telling you niggas, I pop, put a shell in you niggas
I got whores in the Canon camcorder bendin' over
Blowing 'ghan by the quarter, weed odor in the Rover, nigga
Detroit Red gettin' change like them white folks
Pain like a bitch like the first day of a cycle
You better scurry when I pull the (Cannon)
I love head and caressing a voluptuous ass
I ask ya baby mama is she up to the task
She like "Damn Red, it's bigger than (Cannon)"
Get caught slipping with ya mans and you die
Where I'm from niggas be quick to squeeze the (Cannon)
Detroit Red always got some shit for ya ear
Show me love but keep it moving man, cause if you get near
I'll say, get off my dick and tell ya bitch to come here
'Cause you sweating me and my DJ Don (Cannon)
Legs spread far out, you know how I'm standing
I got niggas who don't like rap lovin' our shit
These niggas can't see me like I ain't been around lately
Niggas salty, I'm pepper, no Spinderella
Yeah, Vic found that lick now we not smoking no more regular
Keep ya mid-grade, I don't think you know no better
They love "In Da Trunk", now they wanna hear more shit
I play it modest like "nigga that's some of our old shit,"
Got niggas I ain't never met wanting to fight me
Got hoes that's in love asking "why you don't like me"?
Bitch I'm married to the game and I love my wifey
Steppin' over competition, man I love these Nikes
Yeah, I'm hot, they fanning
Niggas try to copy my style like the Canon
Don't try to compare I'm in a league of my own
All the data is off, ya info ain't valid
Artist of the century the competition ain't balanced
True like Master P and his two brothers
Don't call it incest, but Juice the motherfucker, like
Chyeah

You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen
And all of the curtains, they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken
They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornado's too
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you
(errr!)
You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen (Yeah)
When all of the lights, they get low (Low)
And all of the curtains, they close (They close)
You cannot break down (You can't) what can't be broken
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes
G-code (Can't be broken)
I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You hear me late, I'm laughing in your face
Now fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil a day
For like a million days
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break
You cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close
G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (Can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes, G-code
I can't help but wait
I can't help but wait, check it out
I see you, you wit him, he ain't right but you don't trip
I can't take, to see your face wit those tears running down yo cheeks
But what can I do, I gotta stay true, because deep down I'm still a G
And I don't wanna come between you and your man
Even tho I know I'll treat you better than he can
Girl I can't help but wait
Till you, see you, for what you really are (Baby girl you are a star)
And I can't help but wait
It ain't fresh, to just let him call the shots
Your a queen, you should be, getting all that someones got
You're worth much more than an occasional "I love you", "I'm thinking of you"
Even tho I know I'll treat you better than he can
Girl I can't help but wait
Seeing is believing, and I see what you need so
I'm gonna play my position, let you catch what you been missing
I'm calling out! Girl because I can't help but wait
Can't help but wait, can't help but wait, can't help but wait, no, no, no
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Ahem, excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch
Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to, I'm shootin' when the funeral outside
I'm uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard? Gunna

I'm a bad mother ooh
Just doin' what I do
So smooth, I'm a hustler baby
I just want you to know
Anywhere I've been
Or where I'm about to go
Good afternoon New Orleans
Goodnight America
This is Young Money... Nicki Minaj
They don't make us to break us, no, I'm with the bakers
It's them young stunnas, Nick and Lil Weezy (Weez!)
Nic, I'm the chick, that go getta like Jeezy (Go-getter)
Fall back, cause I do this here
Step ya bars up or you're through this year
Yup it's only right that the whole block stare
Hopped out the air in the blue and white layer
I'm here, I'm with Long-Hair-Don't-Care
Steady starin at my ear, cause my ear on glare
Now it's not hard to find me, top behind me
You be Harry Potter, and I'll be Hermione
I be early, I'm the girl they
Call The One like on my first birthday
I'm in that Range Rov, rocking that Kangol
That pussy real good, it tastes like mango
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money, and we
We get down, and we, we get down, and we...
Boys, they, boys, they love me
(Chromed out eleven hundred)
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money, and we
We get down, and we, we get down, and we...
Ya dig? (Go!) So I guess it's my turn
And I'mma go at niggas' heads like sideburns
Big Phantom on the road, make a wide turn
Big light-green buds, is what I burn
If it ain't about money, me no concern
A paper chaser 'til my thigh burn
And never give a bitch what I've earned
Fuck I look like?
I'm lookin for a bitch that can fuck right, cook right
And if not; then, left foot, right
Foot, get to steppin, yeah bitch, walk light
And my hoes talk like "Hsshswash", and I just say "Right."
We don't fuss fight
She is just... just... just right
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money, and we
We get down, and we, we get down, and we...
Boys, they, boys, they love me
(Chromed out eleven hundred)
Can't stop, won't stop reppin' Young Money, and we
We get down, and we, we get down, and we...
I'm on tour, till my money's like the bus height
Ice looking bright, see me coming like bus lights
Weezy, Nicki Minaj, Young Money
Oh my goodness
Uh
I turned my mansion to a juug house
I did a TV show with Jesse off of Full House
Oh lord, I turned my mansion to a ho house
I did a show way in Haiti, bought the Zoes out
I rolls out in the car with the head missing, the hoes out
Closed mouth, don't get fed shit in the cold drought
I left the court house with a stroll, bounce and no doubt
I know I'm no slouch if Hov vouch, my doors sprout
I help my bro out and get him out the dope house
I never sold loud since that old couch that fold out
Like the pronounce that I am on a whole ounce
Stank so loud like old trout and toes out
Make these hoes crouch, then roll, bounce, then roll out
And kick rocks, I started with six rocks, oh lord (Woo)
Let it breathe
I started off with six rocks
Made 30 dollars, thank god for hip hop
And hit the block with my palms itching like chicken pox
Bop jiggy bop, my niggas hot, my bitch a fox
All you niggas mock, you bit my swag like little crocks
Don't give diddly squat 'bout any man or city cops
Pistol in my sock, no lollipops, we lickin' shots
He was whippin' rock around the clock, oh, how I watched
Then I got shot and then I dropped, then went in shock
Laid up in that hospital room, soon as the doctor knock
You know I hopped up, bounced back like boom shakala
Got rich at 15 and moved momma out
Started off with six rocks, it's a mountain now
I never been a fan of common grounds
I been gettin' green since Bobby Brown
And when you visit, I'm not around
I hope your view isn't from out of bounds
I come to do business, so for your new niggas disguising frowns
Ooh, but my mansion still a ho house
Did a show at home, bought my bros and no foes out
I rolls out in the coupe with the doors out, the whores out
I knows how to move with my nose down
Keep my nose out of people business, news and hoes' mouth 'cause these hoes foul
My pops from the goose, I'm from Eagle Street, Hollygrove child
I used to have the Nissan with Bose sound, I drove around
Chrome 44 with the gold snout, take your crown
Yeah, I guess I'm hoin' now
I been gettin' green, I mean more than cows
Been meaning to settle down, but I be jugglin' hoes like a clown
And if she gullible, I like her style
If she bisexual, I dyke her out
And if she flexible, if she flexible, I'll wrap her 'round
Get head and pussy, call it cap and gown
Oh lord
No ceilings
No feelings
You all in your feelings
I'm like fuck your feelings
Mannie Fresh on the beat
So you made it this far
We upstairs
I let you up here
You special
Marley, don't shoot 'em
You know what this is
It's still Tha Carter II, people
It's still Tha Carter II, people
Yeah, you're still in Tha Carter II, people
Hey! Yeah
A fistful of dollars
A list full of problems
I address 'em like P.O. boxes
The Creole cockpit
We so out of it
Gangsta gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it
I'm wealthy, still fucking with that block shit
Wet your ass up, head to feet, 'til your socks drip
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass
That's Cash Money honey pie
We ain't running, we don't hide
Screaming "Fuck the other side"
Don't get caught on it
This the deadliest grinds
I put your heart on it
And walk on it
How they trace ya
After I erase ya?
Look around
We at war
And you still in preparation
No patience
Slow paper
Fast money don't last too long
You got to know that paper
If you got it from a caper
Feds walls with my pictures on 'em
I don't do too much posing, got a cool killer look
Career crook
Get your career took
I'm back, like a brassiere hook
Bitch, cheer
Camouflage gear
The hunter's here
You ain't nothing but a deer
Around here
And this here is Tha Carter
Serve it while it's hot
Out the pot to your mama
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter
But get your boy some dipping sauce
I got 'em by the collar
Watch me drop 'em
On the head, at the bottom
And you ain't got to shoot 'em
'Cause I already shot 'em
'Cause I already got 'em
Get 'em

She say “what’s happening?”
I say “wassup wassup”
She ask “whats up with me”
I say “whats up with us”
I say “what’s really good?”
I put my love down
She say “it’s really good”
She say “it’s feeling good”
I say “I’m feeling better”
I’m a nasty guy
Dont ask me why
Just ask me how and I’ll show you proud
Her head is gone, she’s in the clouds
And when she rains, man she pours down
And I be the fella without an umbrella
Ma, you finer than a wine cellar
Fuck nigga, them fuck niggas
My blunt bigger than these lil niggas
Keep stuntin' with your bitch ass
You'll get jacked and Jilled, nigga
Fuck wrong with these sissy niggas?
I'm spendin money, spendin money
Ben Franklin dizzy nigga!
Your bitch on my dick, I told her I was busy
She say "Wayne on me, Wayne on me" cause yo ass be drizzlin'
That pussy came gift-wrapped: bow and a ribbon
And if she bounce that ass then I'm dribblin
There's only one me, ain't no equivalent
She give me brain, brain like trivia
I got a black bitch and a red bitch
I call them hoes Aunt Vivian
Chopper knock your face off
Black shades, Ray Charles
I got your ho up in my graveyard
I ain't working with a full deck
But I pull out that Ace card
Clips hanging, no curfew
I'm shining like church shoes
Birdman Jr.: y'all birdfood
I'm bout it.. I said I'm about to cum
Bitch, I'm drowsy
Man, I'm so high I don't know what I'm laughing about
I got bars, nigga and it's happy hour!
Ridin' round with them choppas, not them ninas
Ridin' with a bitch named Molly and she on Molly - ha!
Man these niggas can't see me like a diary
I close one eye, I look like a pirate, fuck it!
TRUKFIT my bitch up, Tunechi leave big nuts
I'm getting my dick sucked
I blow weed like it's dust!
Spacehead: love pussy, hate feds
Told her drive it like it got 8 legs
That Mack-11: necessary
I'm a hard head: I pop the cherry
No pussy no rats, no Tom and Jerry
They say your friends are your enemies?
Well, my friends are imaginary
My ride cold and my bitch hot
I don't gas no bitch, no pit-stop
Smoke Barney and Baby Bop!
Y'all niggas act like lady cops
My niggas smoke like coffee shops
That's syrup gang, wafflehouse
Gunfight, I'll knock you out
My bitch titties is poppin out
We poppin up and we get it poppin
Mask on, gloves on
Like Mickey Mouse, clips stickin out
Like Nicki's ass
Weezy F: I'm big and bad
Small feet, but I kick your ass
I'm the trigger man, and that shooting star
Eat that pussy like caviar
She treat that dick just like a straw
How you like them apples, Microsoft?
Now wipe it off..
I do Liv on Sundays: church!
I got the ball, playing keepaway
Kidnap your ass, kill your ass
Then hide your ass like an Easter Egg!
It's Hollygrove to my deathbed
Hit a nigga with a million shots

And when they hear that new weezy it remind them of that old baby

I'm the Birdman Jr
Yeah, jumped in the game as a youngin' no sisters no brothers
All i had was some money (yea)

The pot runnin over wit hot water
Throw a 8 ball in it watch it come back harder (harder)
That's what they screamin' loud as Aretha
And for them Franklins we pop at the ceaser
Ridin round with the whole block with the speakers (yea)
Have a cigar and a shot of tequila (patron)
I use to wear two socks with my sneakers (hey)
Back when i was puttin all my rocks in my sneakers
Yea but now i'm rockin ya speakers
I'm all grown up now i'm rockin with divas yea

Never filled out a application got plenty work
I'm lookin at 24 bricks on the counter
I'll make them dissapear in 24 hours (gone)

We might hook a nigga up on consignment
And for the rest his life we keep an eye on 'em
Bussiness bad, fuck you pay me
Oh you had a fire, fuck u pay me
I'm might run through 80 in a week
But i can make a quarter million dollars off 1 street
Top in the game off one feet
Then i landed on two and i walked on through
What can you do when you living like me
Get fly in the house leave the pimpin in the street
As quiet as a mouse when you dippin through the street
If you lookin for some work you probably run into me
And on the humble the number still cheap
But the judge got numbers for a nigga to steep
Yea from a youngin to a g
Weezy baby from bundle to a key
And watch the dough boys go crazy

Verse 1 (Lil Wayne)
Fresher than a mothafuckin cocaine pusher
Got work under the stairs, got the gun in the bushes
Anybody want beef, come and meet the butcher
Bring the punk out of a nigga like Ashton Kutcher
Fuck you pay me! like nasty hookers
I got that recipe they tell me pass the cook book
Fuckin wit lil weezy baby thats a good look
So hop your ass on the good book and sha mon'
I ain't really that nigga that you would want to front on
I put ya whole life on ya front lawn .. come on
Son on that shit that none on, gun on
I can drive the whip and work the tooly while with one arm
I tell her dont trip, I'm runnin this bitch, a nigga just gettin his stunt on
Chorus (Rick Ross)
I got a bird in the bag, and the bag on my back
Clear the scene!
Clear the scene!
Clear the scene
Let the g's do they thing X2
Verse 2 Ransom
You fuckers will get it from me
You pop your lip and get ya man shot boy!
I make 'em lean and rock like Dem Franchise Boyz!
You couldn't joust wit me, nigga there ain't no doubt wit me
They got it out for me, dont gotta spell it out for me
Jersey boy, got the whole city that could vouch for me
Dont try to play homie ill pull the eighty out, fade ya out
Put what you was thinkin on ya lady blouse
This a great rookie, ransom, pray for me
Servin raw, till im thirty four, thats a jersey boy
Thats weezy f, ransom, grease yes!
Verse 3 Rick Ross
I'ma whip that dope like a nigga 'posed to do
Hundred thousand dollar whips when the boat roll through
Triple c's, my people we triple g's, while you looking all crooked, my niggas they quick to squeeze!
Slap you with the four five, bitch who you rapping bout
When it come to weight, when I rick ross max it out
I'm the one that they askin bout, in the aston martin, weed sparkin, flickin ashes out
Rick Ross will never ask you out
When I get your number I'ma come and hunt your fuckin mouth
?? 3 5 7 can't touch this

You straight!? I hope ya ass is
I'll leave ya ass as is
Chorus
(Juice 808)
Look what you made me do
Me! That's who
I'm sorry for the wait, I'm sorry for the wait (Tell 'em, tell 'em!)
Tha Carter gon' be late so I cooked up a tape (Tell 'em!)
The garden's full of snakes so I had to escape
Lil homie gon' be straight, lil homie gon' be straight!
Woo! OW!
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
I told myself to save yourself
'Cause I can't save you (I can't save you)
I send my goons to kill somebody
I need head proof (I need head proof)
Fuck it (fuck it!) This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
I ain't trippin', I got Barbie, I got Drake too (I ain't trippin'!)
I send my goons to kill somebody, I need head proof (Mula!)
Then they come through and sit it on my coffee table
Who kept this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who (nigga, me!)
Who was there when niggas left us? Nigga, me, that's who
And if them niggas comin' for me, I'm goin' out like Tony
(Bap-bap-bap-bap)
I just want my money (want my money)
Ain't gotta hold no conversation
Nor my luggage (nor my luggage)
Woo, Birdman Junior – more like Ugly Duckling
Takin' over, now I'm takin' over, yeah (now I'm takin' over)
Think it over? Bitch, I'm thinkin' forward, ta
All I got is Young Money – no more Cash, nigga, ayy!
And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
No more am I my brother's keeper – Cain and Abel
Young Money sharp, I'm still eatin'
I just chipped my tooth (Mula!)
Tell them niggas – no love lost, 'cause I ain't got shit to lose
'Cause I can't save you (I can't save you)
I send my goons to kill somebody
Lord, I must got blurry vision, a nigga's got two faces (amen)
Blood, you gotta protect your neck
It'll suck you dry like raisins, Lord
But fuck that, nigga, got it drawn out
The day you met me is the day Hell froze
On the day I left is when it thawed out (ayy!)
I just had to knock a couple walls down, had to kick y'all out (ayy)
Life is a movie, but sometimes a nigga get too tired of watchin'
And walk out

Carter Treys
But me, me, oh me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I, I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah (haha!)
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn
Uhh, I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
He say he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue
I, I see you with your palms in your pants (haha!)
I make it spin on my finger (yeah) I'm a critical thinker (yeah)
I'm a hell of a smoker (yeah) and a bit of a drinker (hey!)
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn
Uhh, down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
Uh, smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
Yeah I know your name (hey!) yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah (listen mayne)
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a rollercoaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there
And I, see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
As it is, shawty

KL, Fee Fee in the buildin Rome, DI, Ceeti...
I remember then, back in December, it was winter like '89
And I ain't talkin bout speakers
I saw my daddy in there I would stare, but I wouldn't touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Shit, I just knew too much
And I learned how to create it
So come see, or come eat
And I hope that she is having da ride of her life
No red lights in sight
Just a bare room with green lights
Come on now
Who did you, where did you, why did you what did you think she was
That's your ho
But I think you are more crazier than her
Cuz she is no daisy
Shit she jus pottery
My heroes had the broads and the cars with big ol' rims
And I could remember slangin', thinkin'
I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little
When da 5-0 come
Cause I ain't dumb
And that shit I hated
Like early 90's late 80's
I was hustlin' as a baby
You can ask Eagle Street, about me
I'm a G
Cause it made no sense where I was from
To walk around wit none
Shit, nigga you would be crazy
And I'm a 80's baby
Cause in them streets
I'm hot like da 80's
I'm at 100 I'm blazin'
Please, pretty please
You can call me wizzle, or you can call me Wayne, man either one
But it's Weezy Baby for your slut
I told her Weezy Baby, I told her more than once
She just screams out "Baby!" when she's on top of me
And the sheets be stickin' like pages
And the bed is so stanky
If she say that is my baby, shit it is possibly not for me
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all
I've been having these nightmares of losing time, with no reward
Momma would call the Lord, before she call the law
Then I went and found time in a Audemars
Behind the money, get that rhyme report, fuck it
Uh, I don't cut the work, droptop on 20's
Soon as I learned how to talk I talked business
Nigga's ain't safe, all 9 innings
And to you it's just change, I want every JC Penney
And I walk up in your funeral late, suit rented
Lift a mini skirt, get behind her like Benny
Goin' at your neck, get the rope, tie a noose
I'm dirty like ENT, shout out to Murphy Lee
Gotta cut up the credit cards, plastic surgery
I'm a God, mercy me, I'm higher than Mercury
Smokin' on that strong, full of that Hercules
Bartender, hurry up, hurry up with my drink
Niggas pullin capers like they come with a string
I'm standing over the stove with my gun in the sink
Cause I don't know what niggas thinkin, but I know how they think
Uh, catch a skateboard to the jaw
I'm in that pussy, she in awe
And this here is my homeboy, Quick Draw McGraw
I'm even on both sides of the seesaw
Kill you and your right-hand man, southpaw
Money over bitches, and above the law, money
Uh, pocket full of money, with a posse full of hitters
Black and white Porsches, like a Nazi with a nigga
Money make the world, 360
We throw them dollars up, them bitches better be Frisbees
Pounds in the freezer, 50 rounds in the sweeper
Counter full of coke, naked bitch baggin' up
I love this shit so much, I got on a tux
Man, it's been a minute since I seen my nigga Bubba
Some niggas fade away, some niggas hit the jumper
Kidnap your niece, don't cry, call your uncle
We don't wanna hurt ya, baby, we just want your uncle
I ain't hearin' that bullshit, I'm deafer than Leppard
Somewhere out wherever, they find your body severed
You know they findin' niggas guilty like they finding treasure
But get your money on occasions, I get too wasted
It's an occasion
I heard a nurse say, "Thank you for being so patient"
I know my nigga's got me, we good forever
Get the cheese nigga, please, avoid the shredder
Turning good to better, gotta pull it together
I wish that blood on the floor, was rose petals
Real gangstas die of old age
And old money, get paid, my nigga, Tunechi
(Intro, Paul Wall & [Juelz Santana])
Swisha House baby
Fuck 'em
(Hook, Paul Wall & [Juelz Santana])
We don't give a fuck about you

Nope, coke in the trunk

You don't want my niggas leavin wit'cha gooooods (Gooods)
So don't play like that (Don't)
Don't act like that (Don't)
(Hook)
I got them windows tinted, five-percent
Presidential limo tint
I can see you, but'chu can't see me
Two-twenty-three with extended clip
Them fifty shots gon' set it off
So fire drill, bitch drop and roll
Gimme that watch, gimme that chain
Empty them pockets and pay the toll
I hang with killas out on parole
Evacuate, murder-for-hire
Kinda like Omar from the wire
We'll chop ya up like garlic cloves
And cook ya ass, like Elmer the chef
Take ya last breath, put on ya vest
But I'm aimin at'cha head boy, not'cha chest
Now pack the iron, I'll start'cha dyin
That'll slob a knob and piece me up
And when ya wake up, in the morning
To the sounds of them choppers roaring
We'll leave ya whole family in mourning
I'm in the hood like wig shops
I'm on the grind, on the block
Posted up like Yao Ming
We'll chop ya up like a Screw tape
And have ya hollerin like the Opera
But with my side-kick goin off
I ain't talkin about no T-Mobile partna
(Hook)
That girl got you too too excited
That money had you too too excited
Them cars had you way out your character
That jewelry got you way out your character
Them girls got you way out your character
This fame got you way out of character
I showed you love now you way out of character
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known
Because I'm on and I'm saucy
And I'm gone and you salty
Steam coming from your head like a coffee
My reality is better than your dreams nigga
My ho pussy hole is wetter than your dreams nigga
Put your head in a microwave, DING! nigga
You out of character, slime, you out of character
And me I'm out of patience, sick and tired like Malaria
These hoes like mosquitoes
Supa where the cup at
I'm working on my comeback
The girl I'm with got much class
But she got a dumb ass
I keep a money bag, a drug bag, and a gun bag
These niggas ain't even shining, making the sun mad
Rappers in my lunch bag
Bedroom full of new dykes
Old green and new white
That's old money, that's new coke
That's Young Money, that's 24/7, 3-6-5
That's Cash Money; I'm like "Who ho" Who ho, who ho!?
I should've known you would cross me (I'm on my patio)
I should've known you would cross me
(Thinking about Hollygrove)
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me (I tell 'em adios)
I was looking in your eyes you ain't built like that
You ain't built like that (I should've know)
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I be with the robbers and the killers and the kidnappers
Still fuck a bitch, fuck the ring, motherfuck a pastor
I got this money and I ain't turning down
This money'll turn your life up but bring your family down
Cause some of the closest niggas to me, I'll gun 'em down
For real
I should've known you'd cross me
I'm from the hood, that's where they taught me
Go hard until they off me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I should've known you would cross me
I got some niggas that was there
That ain't no longer there
I don't care
I should've known you would cross me
(I,I,I, dont want you to see me cry)
Rest In Peace Lil Naughty
Fuck you bitches, Coppers
Yea, You laughing
(I,I,I, dont want you to see me cry)
This here's real man
Harsh but hard
You damn sure can't take the weight
Momma had to hustle cause my pop was jive
Momma had 1 son 2 jobs
What a woman! Come from where the women gotta work like men
So we ain't need dad we got money like him
No school clothes no child support
And next year I'll probably be up in a Robb Report
I'm important so is my clique I'm riding for them
God lead us not into dividing waters
Guide my daughter see that she walk a straight one
I live positive stay away from snitches, haters and broke niggas with they face hung
All the folks are ready for whenever that day come
Got a cool two million hiding until that case comes see me just a a riding to the bass drum
So if you feel me put ya blunts in the air
And blaze one and don't cry
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid baby I'm just a man
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
I'm on the grind like all the time
I got money but murder don't cost a dime
All sorts and kinds of car jewels clothing
I'm looking like a porcupine
But me I'm so bright I keep walking by
Keep barking hater yeah ya talk a lot but me I'm at the top and I ain't talking down
Man they acting like they don't know I'm from Apple & Eagle
But the eagle will bust ya apple fo sho

And light the weed up
Fix ya G up and don't cry!
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head

(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
And if you happen to see a tear that don't mean I'm afraid baby I'm just a man and
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
I remember the look on your face momma when them doctors told you I made it your son is gonna be aight he made it
I remembered then they come in there and they asked me did I wanna see you
I told them no
I was only scared
This some crazy shit
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
I got shot when I was 12
Shot again at 20 will I shake these old dreams
Lord wake me up to holy water on my face and 3 blood drops dried on the side of my eyes
Why we gotta kill our own kind when we rise
Got me looking down the ladder now when I climb
And they don't wanna drive
They wanna learn how to work the tool
And who am I not to do the duty
Just think if pops advice get sent from black ink
And that stinks but homie that's real
And in the hood even steaks smell bad on the grill
I remember when if you was a hustler you was a winner
Now that's like raking up leaves in the winter
And that ain't even cool to miss a few summers
I'll take a bite out the onion like
Fuck it!
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
And won't cry
(Hook)
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
Pass the weed lemme take it to the head
Hope the smoke turn my eyes red, my eyes red cause
(I,I,I, don't want you to see me cry)
And straight level vodka's the potion, makes me spill my emotion and
Keep on coming with that gangsta music young Weezy got that mother fucking gangsta music

And I hope you know you ain't never too live to die
I grew up where them people called them people on us
Think we slangin, but we just got beepers on us
Grindin' all day like we got sleep insomnia
Livin' like the videos write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they put cement on us
Ghetto birds still shittin on us, government still quittin' on us
So we got the names writtin on us
White folks still spittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
Beezy ain't here... where's Beezy at?... Beezy got killed
And that was my nigga, I go way back wit my nigga
But I know thats how it happened my nigga
Shit is much deeper than this rappin my nigga
So I'mma play the captain, sail boat flappin my nigga
No fingas I'm snappin', happy for my nigga Lil' Tiggas
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Found his body like a month later, Rest in Peace boy
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'mma keep goin, and I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin the flow
My nigga Lil' Derrick is quick to cop a key
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that he's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family and his mama fine
I think about it all the time
I drink about it all the time
Cause if my thoughts got to me I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can, thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yea
Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The five o killed naughty good boy dead
Shot 'em up face down on the lawn
Not to mention with his handcuffs on
Not to mention they had plain clothes on
But don't nobody do nothin' bout it
The jailhouse and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And haters at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin iPod
Shit and they tried to burn my phantom up
But I got my gun license, I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a camera
Stay still mothafucka I'mma have to write my will this summer
Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yea
And you can put that on my late father
Or my grandfather Larry Bosock
And all I know 'bout my real pops is that he had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag money
Yea he might hit me off wit a little brag money
But thats why when I see him I acts mad funny -
Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama how it's suppose to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope for me
And I don't ever want to see her mope for me
Hopefully, but truthfully there is a day that's due for me
But we gone pray it's as far as the future sees
Amen
I know 'round the world I be gettin' to the money
She crazy for the dick and I'm addicted to the money
It's a dirty world and my cup too, it's so muddy

My lady talkin' crazy, I done listened to the money
She crazy bout this dick and I'm addicted to the money

And took the bitch straight to the fuckin' mall
I get higher than cholesterol

Get her own page in the black book

If it's that good, I put a stamp to her
Double-edged sword and a bubble, boy
I just won a war in a Hummer 'fore I'm 'bout to come to yours
Lookin' for a war, I am nothin' more than somethin' more

As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’
The sky is fallin’, fallin' down
I turn into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin’ on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I'll be waiting, I’ll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactic, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you (for you, for you)
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you

The reaper's comin' slow
Shhh...
I can hear the reaper comin'
But I ain't scared, oh, no, no, I ain't runnin'
Angels on my shoulders are usin' me for a battle
Spiritual warfare, good versus evil
I even fought the demons as a semen
Yes I was brought there, cursed ever since my day of birth
Got a Heaven-sent flow, though it's Hell on Earth
So, with that in mind, I don't live for Prada
I'm trying to stack and mack, and got stigmata
Tryin'a get the same fan base as Big Poppa
Sometimes, when I flow, they say the southern Big's popped up
But I'm from Holly Grove, I can't give the block up (Holly Grove)
You already know
(Bring it home mang)
You might see me on the side of the road
(Who knew this nigga could sing?)
I asked the Lord to be my coat and umbrella
'Cause outside it's rainin' cold
It's so cold
It's so cold (America)
It's so cold
I say, Miss America, Land of the Free
Then you turn that half-a-acre that I had into a pool

We making house calls, I'm an outlaw, in the south ward
Knock your ass out if you talk stupid
Got a big dick so I walk stupid
Hold on, bad hoes need to get a raise, lame niggas tryna get away
But all ya diamonds need to get appraised, you in the way
Too many nights I was out lurking, mind in a daze, nowadays
I'm on Ocean Drive with a bad bitch lyin' in the shades
Sipping Minute Maid, gotta penetrate, let me demonstrate
Got a backwood with the dank in it
Go Blake Griffin, might flex on 'em
That's too much sauce, I bet them hoes know who I are
They treat a nigga like a superstar and that's what I am
I got your bitch but that's my bitch
So that's our bitch and that's all cool
When you trip out, wan' dip out, she just call me and I fall through
And that's bad news, hold these nuts, cashews
Vroom, I flew past you, new whips here, what the bags do
Past cool, young Jones
My enemies should get a good breakfast and a cup of coffee
I know refugees that don't rush things, they kill 'em softly
My closet still got Nike boxes and a couple corpses
Look, even though I'll never sell my soul, I got a couple offers
Don't think about it, I smoke about it, I drink about it
They wrap the body, then rap about it
Sink the body, then sing about it, zip the body, then sip about it
Fuck the world, I'ma still get some cool things up out it
If a CEO wanna dance all in my videos, I need a big deposit
Swerve, swerve, I'm back on 'em
My bad, I'm turning my back on 'em
Real shit, I've seen good girls go to airports with that pack on 'em
Trill shit, I've seen bad bitches with good genes but I slack on 'em
I ain't focused there, Gotham City, got Batmans and Jokers there
So I had to "abracadabra," "voila," just to make hope appear
Young!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Told momma, nana, I'm doing my count
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mula! Voila!
Mama, nana, I'm doing my count
Don't ruin my count, bust two, and I'm out, voila!
Magic dust, yeah that's a rush
Got her cracking up, crying all at once, man, that was fun
Satanical like Skeletor, you greener than a salad bar
I leave from here to Africa to read some Maya Angelou
Impractical, you acting all DiCaprio; we trap and go for casserole
That magic snow, it's always cold and my freak on that molly water
I met this bitch on Collins but she out the hood, her mama cook
I'm on the way, I'm on a stage, the Magic show, I feel like Dave
I pop up out of nowhere, bop-bop at your doorbell
Disappear in thin air, all we leave is smoke there
Smoking roadkill, she on coke here
Stash is sticking to her nosehair
I'm a magician in the motel, moving tricks for wholesale
We rata-ta-ta-ta over the chatter, we got mo ammo than grammar
Hammers and hammers, pull up in Lambos
Shoot up the cameras, die in pajamas
Find you with Sam and your wife and your mamas
All in your family, I'm balling like Magic, voila!
Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
You don't believe in magic, but you know that I'm for real
Don't ruin my count, bust two and I'm out
Voila! Abracadabra, abracadabra!
We rata-ta-ta-ta, then disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just popped a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know I'm too real
Voila! Voila! OVO shorts, high socks
Time out, na-na, I got sauce, you dried out
I'm big boss, you big mouth, magic show, don't miss out, voila!
What haven't I done yet?
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeño
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat
I go tape worm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big headed my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes
Lil Tunechi
I might book me for a show
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class pictures
I like math, all I did was add bitches
Swagga galore, got your girl on all fours
It's not doggystyle, I call it froggystyle
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it
Everything authentic, plus I named my pistols
Last name "Fuck," first name "I Don't Give A"
Pockets look pregnant, they 'bout to deliver
So when I start pimpin', you know the procedure
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss....I'ma need some more S's
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
Cuz I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered
These niggas think they hard, these niggas just nipples
I pop a nigga like a 'sicle, drop a nigga like a missle
Mo' money mo' issues, I size you up then fit you
Tunechi
I got Spitta hot Spitta in the building with me mane
Who ever thought he'd be chilling with me mane
And since he make millions with me mane
Police try to stop but they can't
So fuck the law, nigga and fuck the po'
I thug vicious bitch I'm from Hollygrove
Who that is? Weezy F. Baby
Please, baby, please say the baby
Please say the baby
I'm a Hollygrove nigga got the 17th in me
Pussy ass niggas bring the 17th out me
Prolly leaping off a mountain
Turning the gun around and skeet-skeeting in your mouth and
South man, outstanding flow
Bada-bam-bing hoe
Weezy do his thing hoe
Checking in the Four Seasons gotta have a neat hoe
Mama a freaknik like 1993
And like she probably be the wife that you go to sleep with
I be like, I don't feel like fucking but I could do ya sweet lips
I'm running through my box of Sweets I need some more Tez
The gangstas, the hood, the fallen soldiers
To the down ass chicks that keep it in the slums
You smell that?
Big shouts to Hollygrove
Can't forget Magnolia Projects
Young Mula Baby
Money on my mind
(what the) fuck a nigga thought?
He ain't even thank
Walked up to him put the pistol to his tank
Pussy nigga faint
Where I'm from we see a fuckin dead body everyday [x3]
Hammer in the draws
Hammer in drawers
And ya'll ain't nothin but nails in the wall
Posters, holsters
Empty like a muthafucka
Hehe, ok simply I'm a bug- lover
It's fly carter, duckin the fly swatter
Simply, I'm a muhfucka
Pimpin' ain't dead, because I'm pimpin like a muhfucka
Now where ya ho at?
Wipe ya feet on the door mat
I'm a bring in, no back
Like em to go with no back
I'm a-go forward, the top can get lower, them hoes 'gon get cut
Like a sword, I know it
You ain't gotta tell me
You pussy niggas eatin' peanut butter and jellys
Ya los' like angeles
But you can find me in the white tan Ellis
Just like Van Halen
I'm a rock out bitch
I'm a wear that Glock like a fucking outfit
You ain't no nothin' 'bout this

And I’m like let me at em! Call me Scrappy Doo
Hazardous to scrap with you I ain't lookin stupid
You beat me? Too bad, bitch, I’m comin back shootin!
Fool I’m a fool, I do what I do
Tha Tech or the Uz, the Mac or the Rug
Catch you when it’s just you, You’re like “it wasn’t just you!”
I guess i’m just to real for niggas to adjust to
Fuck me? Naw bend over nigga, fuck you
Move you lose you move an inch and more ligaments that you could lose
I’ll put you on the 10 O'clock news
One, two, buckle ya shoes
Here come the Kid who
Ooo gloves Uz will fill up your old wounds
Dudes using more tools than Tim from Home Improve
Then I play it cool, smooth as James Brown shoes
Don’t play with him cuz shoot he’ll shoot
I’m loose as a goose on that goose with them hoes
I’m playin duck duck goose, boy I’m slick like mouse
I’m tha truth not a fluke I’m a murderer, Fuck you!
Put niggas on mute like
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Dear Anne, my number one fan
With my pen in my right hand and that's also my mic hand
Codeine in a Sprite can, ink on the white pad
And I'm thinking of life, Anne, and wrong and right, Anne
And sometimes I'm right and sometimes I might
Cannot find the light still my rhymes are bright
So I continue my plan and I'm sure like white sand
That they'll be price paying before my flight land
Adore so I can't ignore what I want anymore
So I just go you can call me the goer
And oh, yeah, I got a girl, she act like I owe her
And uhm, sometimes it seems like I just don't know her
But I really hope I'm not starting to bore, page one
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Dear Anne, my number one fan
I hope everyone's good, I hope everybody's praying
I hope, hold up baby, let me switch hands
See, lately I've been dealing with a lot of shit, Anne
It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan
And everytime I look there's a problem with this man
But your support held me up like kickstands
And I'm also being more careful in how I pick friends
But on another note, this ain't just another note
And I'm just hoping that you read this far, page two
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Dear Anne, my number one fan
By now, you probably think that I'm portraying who I'm saying
And it's people like you that make me proud of what I am
Hey, you are the shit, damn, pardon the gram'
And shit, when my life is like some sort of exam
It's a jungle out there, lions, horses and rams
Shit, as I sit and wait for the war to begin
I just think of you then I'm rewarded again, Anne
So with you is where a part of me stands, Anne
I hope I see you in the stands, Anne
Because you know I understand, Anne
And I'm sorry about Stan
So I wrote this to say that I'm your number one fan
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
Do we run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Livin' that life, livin' that life
But it ain't bright enough to show me where I'm going
Try me and your family don't sleep right
Didn't think I was tough enough to make it on my own
But I could get through anything if I done made it through the storm, and umm
I'm killing that night, killing that night
Life on that East Side
Leather on chrome, television with the phone
And the top is so gone
I do it so right, I do it so right
They want me to be like
I'm in the zone, bad to the bone
Times is hard as it is
And all I wanna do is handle my biz
And all I'm tryna do is whatever I did, Dear Lord
Everyday I've been praying to you
I hope You're hearing everything that I'm saying to You
I get money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm dying to get over
And once I get over, good Lord I know
That all my drama's over
And I thank you
They ride around with that rope, and they'll hang you
On that Holiday note
Damnnnn,Then they put a sign on the do'
Saying you don't know shit
You gotta know how it go
Or else you could end up in another bump in the road
You see
A prisoner of this war
We call America
And he already won, damn
And Armageddon and depressions already begun
But it's my aggression
Cause I'm gonna spread you some
I know my people tired
Of all the crying, all the dying
To get our mind off the crime and find somethin' to find
That my life is on the line
Give me rope, and I'mma climb
I'm hoping that the Gates'll be open when I arrive
Until then, I'm alive
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
Yeah, Suffix, people, yeah
You know
You, you, you already
Yeah, come on
Kickin rocks on the block, tellin all the OGs
"I be coming for your spot when you're not looking"
Hot cooking, momma got it on the kitchen table
I thank God we were always able to
Get the leather couch, big screen, cable too
Nintendo when them good grades came through
Then the cooked Ks came through
Thought I heard niggas coming, thought I saw the cop lights but
I was dreaming, then I woke
The junkies was still fiending, and I had coke, so
I had hope; you may say that it's wrong
But I ain't talking to your child, I'm talking to this song
I'm just doing a buck down memory lane
And yes, my niggas the same, but they quicker to bang
So I shoot first anyway, and I would do the honors any day
Show your ass how to take four and get eight
And it don't take four niggas to get straight
The only hot boy eating off this plate, Young...
Give her ass a location and a template
Show her how to work the interstate
Stop working with that thinner weight, get your brakes fixed
Stop playing, 'cause all we know is gunplay
Ain't nobody safe when it's for the kids' sake
Hurricane wipe the south like a earthquake
We tryna save face, but we ain't got a place
We on our way, pussies; relocate
Y'all know us when you see us, put your jewels up
Put your cars, put your clothes, put your shoes up
It's that serious, homie, pick the news up
It wasn't good, nigga, think about the hood, nigga
The people who ain't never had shit, ain't gon never have shit
Bullshit, 'cause they still gon try to manage
Niggas with nothing lost families
Lives lost in traffic
But a nigga got passion
Even though the bounce-back seeming like Magic
Shit, but call me Siegfried
Watch how I turn one key to a hundred Gs
Yeah, dear summer, summer breeze
Summer, please know I live for you
Throw on the wife-beater, let back the lid for you
A few years I'll prolly hear from you, but now I'm here for you
I know niggas that shed a tear for ya
Behind bars, tryna get to ya, they'll prol'ly never see you
It's that real talk if you ever heard it, homie
Shit hurt so much, might have to hurt you, homie
No commercial, no fronting, no curve on it
The drought's here, not only white slowed up
But that's the last thing, 'cause hustle is what we do
But hustle with what? How we getting on?
Where he sitting at? What he sitting on?
Stand up if you know it's true
Shit... And this is after disaster, this ain't rap, this a recap
Stepping off the G4, still strapped
Bust your head in the air, that's a sky-cap
Have my car pick me up where I arrive at
Drop the work off 'cause it don't go where I reside at
Garbage bags filled up with dollars
Dead presidents, gotta dump the bodies
Birdman, as long as we gon' eat
Then everybody eat off me
Feet off ground, fingers to the stars, reaching
When everything paused, I proceeded
Fuck the world, not the people, damn!
The people asking me ''Wayne, what's crackalacking''? I can't kid
I ain't smelling out my ass, mama, I ain't shit
But you can't tell my mama that I ain't the shit
And if you talk about my mama bet I'm all in your shit
All of the things go to my mama cause she brought me in this
And ever since I never miss her, never called in sick
I go to work, I don't quit, mama taught me this
''You go berserk for that crib, baby boy, don't slip''
I'll murk you for them chips and make Frito Lay
I'm trying to come up on the fortress, split it 3-4-ways
And you ain't gotta do nothing but be your age
But mama how can I? I will be so paid
She kept me with money, I keep her with money, she like
I got my weight up
Pops passed, I had to get off my ass
Had to put it in little bags and get off my grass
I used to carry off-white like cash
Now I tote handguns like bags
Ain't too much changed
Still pitch and give 'em a split or a change up
I never up and change, I just get my change up
I'm greasy with the game, Joe Casey gave me, I'm an animal
But niggas taste this and lick nuts like ladies
I get ape quick and hit up like I get
I deflate the game and insert my dick
That mean I fuck the game so fuck the game
I grind to the money, say fuck the game
Man, niggas wonder why I got out, I won the game
I'm a champion
And when I got paid I gave back what I owed
Making haters taste crack when I'm attacking the roads
You know what's under the seat, I got the Combat 4
Gave a nigga one, bet he don't come back no more
Nope - it's Weezy F and the 'F' is for flow
I get it sacking, act like I came back from coke
Not guilty or Jesus, let rabbit go
Wow, that's my daddy if ya'll ain't know
And I love him with every second my hard day go
Who you think got that blood up off that flo'?
How you think that young boy come off so old?
I miss you pops
You tatted your face
You screamed, "Suu whoop"
You bought a Bugatti, so you can flex
Most of the bad bitches your ex
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
New subject, new paper, new class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs
Much later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move
Two eyes to view but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you?
Two middle fingers that's up high to whom
It may consume, kaboom, goddamn
Who knew that I am the guru with voodoo
That sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan
Go over the diagram and get to the job, man
Sit back and watch and do not watch your watch hand
Give me some time, man
I am the bomb, man
I am gon' swim 'til I come out on dry land or on the fryin' pan
No, we did not land on Plymouth Rock
But it landed on our land, now I'm just buyin' land
Back to the block where they got more rock fans
We need Barack, man, I do what I can
To keep it solid as a you know what I'm sayin'
You tatted your face and changed the culture (You changed)
You bought a Bugatti so you could flex (So you can flex)
And most of the bad bitches your ex
I started this shit, you just part of this shit
I'm the heart of this shit, and the heart doesn't skip
Take the heart of yo' bitch, 'cause like Bart, you a simp
And your water don't drip so your garden ain't shit
You just countin' the money, I'm drownin' in money
Like, "Where the fuck is the lifeguard in this bitch?"
For the art of this shit, Andy Warhol and shit
I go tart on this shit, I'ma barf on this shit
I'm a martian and shit, you an orphan, lil' bitch
If I taught you some shit, that's like Harvard, lil' bitch
You ain't talkin' 'bout shit but you softer than shit
Walk it like you talk it, now you walkin' in shit
I go Marvel movie on some marvelous shit
This is Tha Carter, lil' bitch
You tatted your face and changed the culture (You changed)
You screamed, "Suu whoop," and them gangsters loved you (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You bought a Bugatti so you could flex (So you can flex)
And most of the bad bitches your ex
I started this shit, they borrowed this shit
I thought of this shit, they thought it was it
I'm doggin' this shit, they bark and they sit
Put a fork in that shit, which drawer to look in?
I brought in this shit, the starters get benched
The orders get sent, then targets get hit
Billion dollar smile
I sell myself short if I grin, I'm bargainin' then
Apartments and shit, I could park in this shit
In the foreign car that I could talk to and shit
With a cultural bitch I can talk to and shit
'Bout the culture and shit, how I altered this shit
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
All of that shit, just tha Carter lil' bitch
You changed, suu whoop (You tatted your face)
Bugatti, new boo (You screamed, "Suu whoop")
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tunechi

Murder the adults and let the kids get adopted
Sit it in the pot and watch me rise to power

That's my nigga Juelz, I been here since twelve
Ten shells, let 'em save themselves

But you should be afraid of me (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Young veteran, soon to be OG
Plus I spit like a crackhead with no teeth

You like a nigga with no guns, you gets no peace
And when it comes to money my shit is obese
More money, what the fuck these niggas telling me?
I'm young Lucifer, take em all to hell with me, yeah
If he testify like Common, see the fire bomb
If you know what's best, mothafucka, get your quiet on
These niggas starving out here getting they diet on
While I'm eating, nigga, gripping on my styrofoam
For now, I'm with your girl, getting my Rowdy Roddy Piper on
Willie the Kid, pull guns like a hamstring
Blow like a trombone, funny niggas, tambourine
No blood no foul, yeah, my heart cold as Moscow
We nap ya kin like a hot towel (Gangsta!)
All my hoes hostile, not me, never tell me "not now"
Roof-remover, we leave your brain with more air
Maneuver, I leave your bitch with a moist chair (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Seduce her, yeah, you rappers should be tired of lyin'
But I know it's hard like a tire iron
But yet it's complex, like it's Mayan science
Or Aztec math, I'm crazy as a mesc' tab
And yes, y'all, It's Willie, how I address y'all
Or like a stylist, nobody's fly as this

'Cause I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
Yeah, I'ma kill 'em, yes, I'ma kill 'em
And I'ma kill 'em, I'ma kill 'em
They say powder makes you hyper, reefer makes you calm
Cigarettes give you cancer, woo-woos make you dull
While I sip the purple harlot, thick as my Southern drawl
Put me on the ocean floor wit a mermaid wit no draws
They got bats up in the cave, upside-down
Blood rushing to they head, they reacting off sound
As I stand on the mound, pitching for the crown
Old-ass rappers complaining what the business is
'Bout the state of hip, soundin like some bitches
Hop your ass up off a rich nigga dick, it's ridiculous
The new school nigga, what you need to do is become a resident
Under conditions, get your ass up off your ass
Like Federer and Nadal, Young Money, nigga, we ball
Like Kobe or Chris Paul, forgiving a wack cracker
For no cash, like, "Bitch, gimme that ass"
Or pulling up to the lot like, "Gimme that Jag'"
No, pulling up to the lot like, "Gimme that Lam'"
They study me, yeah, they cram, like I'm a final exam
If I hit you in your back, tou'll need a spinal exam
I'm something like a rhino or ram, animal, beast
Irritating you pussies like chlamydia, yeast
Or be like this beat, R.I.P., deceased
Yeah, I'ma kill 'em, yes, I'm kill 'em
I'ma kill 'em (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Yeah, already, you better call every pallbear-ier in y'all area
The ball carrier gon' get popped, if I'm coming around the block The in-swing drive gets stopped, he gon' drop like a flop
On the court, I love sports, that's why I play my bitches
'Cause I got game, that's why you pay my bitches, yeah
I'm just hip-hopping like two bunnies (Gangsta!)
Who run it? Bitch nigga, moi
That was French, nigga, not a kiss, nigga, nah
Ha, no homo, rappers get ate like four and four
They say I fucked so-and-so
And I be like "So, so and so"
Nikes on they neck, they like, "Let me breathe"
I'm sorry, but I can't, this is how we feed (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
This is why we hot, this is how we freeze
Too fast to follow, this is why we lead
And the money in the pocket isn't why we Gs, see
This is how we shoot and this is how we leave (Gangsta!)
You know we tote steel, this is how we ease
You can get the steel if you try these thieves, now
Pass me the Swisher, let me climb these trees
And them haters say we couldn't, this is why we bes
Like gravity's pulling, putting it down
Like gravity's pulling, putting it down

Yeah, I know that water get cold but I dive in it bare
And swim through it alive and aware, I been through it
I gets to it like just do it, I miss doing it
A hundred shot drum, play 'em some clip music
All it takes is one signal you can get a cadence
You can get it catered, I'm at your service like a waiter

Cause my flow is for real like the Sahara in hell
Comparisons is irrelevant, I'm an arrogant male, yeah
I can handle it, I can graduate Yale, yeah
They featherweight, I sporadically ill
Peep the narrative of the New Orleans heritage
You can go get your evidence, I tell where and tell you when
I was getting my adolescence in
Lesser than God only, better than my last that's what strive for
Dwelling on my past I get high, so I light it up and smoke
Keep that Mary Poppins poppin' like a toaster
I'm Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Can't forget that purple potion, oh shit
So shit, I blow bigger in MASH and laugh
I'm the best, no shit
The song goes like:
Deeboa then bass.. dun dun dun dun dun its like a deepoa
Whats its called
No, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake
She got a pussy like the Garden of Eden
I tip-toe through the tulips
And I'ma do me, scratch me off my to-do list
Loose lips sink the cruise ship
Even gigabyte get their two chip
Havin' a pillow fight with a cute bitch
With a body like a belly dancer
She say you scared of this pussy cat, well if that's a panther
I hope it's pink, I read her mind, yeah I read every chapter
I ain't got time to play no games
Gimme mind, don't play no games
She say she'll slit me if I'm vain, I said "objection, sustained"
This shouldn't affect my affection
She say she sent from Heaven
That's why all flights were connected
I still use protection, if she's a blessing in disguise
But I swear it's a damn good disguise, because I can't tell
She wish she had me on lock
But there's so many other niggas doin' time
In her brain cells, damn, uh
No, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake
Uh, am I sleepin' with the devil?
How the hell should I know
My heart beat echoes 'cause my insides are hallow
If anyone have a towel, wipe the guilt off my face
My high's comin' down like my stilts about to break
And what goes around, comes around, out a swirly straw
Then she put that shit on me, I feel like some dirty draws
She say "just don't leave me Wayne, 'cause life is short"
I say "I'm touched but baby, pimpin' ain't a contact sport"
She dyed her hair, I asked her "when's the funeral?"
And Gisselle may leave her house without makeup and still be pretty
I pour champagne on her, she put cocaine on mine
And we forget everything and six-six-six nine, alright
No, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake
Hot pussy loosie, she be goin' at my neck
But I be shot, puttin' loosie, and I sweat when I'm around her
Regret when I'm around her
Ask me "would I die for her?" I say "dead before designer"
'Cause I see through her flames and she see through my snow
She gon' be singin' the blues, hope she could hit them high notes
And I swear that pussy taste like Devil's Food Cake
Give me a toothache, I feel like fool's gold on April Fool's Day
But I ain't a fool for love 'cause play with love, you get hurt
No, no, staying awake
Am I sleepin' with the devil? Hell if I know
No, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake
No, no, staying awake
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleepin' very gently so now they're startin' to enter it
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
She fucked thy niggas, see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
Brought the demon out her ass too
I'm a demon, I demand you
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon, I demand you
You brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out the man, ooh
You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands
A demon with demands, a demon with demands
I'm a demon with demands, I got demons on demand
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a demon by demand too
Yeah, brought the demon out the man, ooh
She agree to my demands too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Brought the demon out her ass too
Sleepin' with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
And now they're startin' to mentor me, geekin’ like Brittany
Tweakin' my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, come alive mentally
And love die physically, my love cry miserably
Hugs gettin' looser, her tongue tied kissin' me
She fucked thy niggas see now they both iggin' me
But demons got dignity, demons got memories
I had a lil' revenge in me, so now I'm at sentencin'
'Bout to stop gigglin' and dinner start sizzlin'
A demon, with demands
You done pulled the demon out the man, pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth then pulled it clean up out your ass
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her past
Brought the demon out her ass too
You done brought the demon out the man, ooh
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic, demonic
Demon with demands, demon with demands
I think I’m seeing things
When I don’t see a thing
I woke up and realized
All the nightmares that dreaming brings
Let my people go
Now load up choppers
Point it at the coppers
Let-let freedom ring
I like the sweeter things
So what bitch, no needle strings
I wake up, stretch my feet and wings
My life has no deleted scenes
I pop-pop-pop and leave the scene
Leave the scene Noxzema clean
Sippin on that lean cuisine
Incredible Hulk on creatine
Fuck the world
And may I mention, fuck the world again
Tune, you down to go around the world again?
I am
And you can trust in a nigga like fam
I’m hitting these licks with my niggas like stamps
Giving these hoes headaches like rams
Yes ma’am
And I
I just might call your girl a friend
But fuck her like she my girlfriend
Talk to her like she my girl
Like, oops you look like my girl’s twin
I sin, I'm bad, I meant "My bad"
I’m lost in future, present, past
All those drinks I had
I speed, I'm fast, I blink, I crash
They say it’s my time
I’m racing time, I think I’m last
And if Tune mentions lean again
The underdogs understand what I lay over tracks
New school, but all I listen to is older raps
Bitch I still
I still been drinking on the low
And pimpin haven't died and money getting old
And now the wrinkles starting to show
My rims twinkle like a toe
One thing led to another, and then the pencil broke
I got that; handgun on the table, shotgun in the closet
Police in disguises, I don’t like surprises
I don’t like tomatoes, I don’t like tamales
Shoutout to my plugs, I pray the rats don’t chew the wires
Straight ballin, you niggas just bald spots
When they tried to read my palms the pages were torn out
And you pussy niggas get hauled off
No cough drops
I’m tryna make the same cash off rap they made off pop
I killed more than I did with a gun with a skill
I’m no role model
I’m rollin' with models, rollin' off pills
I’m rollin' over
Whoever's not rollin' with us, then road kill
Tryna get Uncle Phil cake
In case I die tryin' I wrote Wills
'Til I can’t figure out the code
To get the motherfucking safe open
Who the fuck left the cage open
Stage of rage
I’m liable to blow your fucking face open
Every bone you could break, broken
If I go broke, every home I could break in, broke in
Pussy look like a steak smokin'
Niggas slippin' like the lake frozen
And I hate rodents
Off the straight potent
'Til it make no sense
Niggas talking shit
Nigga I can get you wacked
Nigga you can picture that
'Til you break your lens
Nigga take your ends
Nigga fuck your ho
Nigga cut your throat
Taking out your trash
Pull up on you slow
Going nowhere fast
Nigga hung 'em by a rope
Fuck 'em, adios
Fuck 'em, I don't care
Got a bad bitch naked
And she just asked
“What you gonna do to me that I ain't done to myself?”
I say “Ooh talk dirty, but don’t talk long"
You leave Wayne’s world it’s a long walk home
My pockets on that growth hormone
I call them shots, can I get a dialtone
Yeah
Mula, can I get a million
'Til the heads or tails
Full fledge, full house
And what are friends for
I’m still the boss, don’t get sent for
Roger that, 10-4
Nigga send me, point 'em out
Where he at, I got 'em
We don't wanna see you back in court
The weed so loud bitches get ignored
Cause I ain't got time to go back and forth
Bitch, if you do you asking for it
Feeling like A-rod after ‘roids
I'm from Prov city
And I’m from New Orleans
The part that’s destroyed
Go
She is a cutie
Somebody say they saw us kissin' in the movies

We saw Rush Hour 2
Then we went home and we made our own movie
Lights, camera, action, ya' dig?

Every single word your little ear wanna hear

And if your pussy stank, girl, you know you better douche it
You're nasty, girl, now wash that stanky, funky, funky pussy, bitch
And I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place 'cause you and your man be planning to hate
I'm so hood
And she likes it, and when we fuck, I'm keepin' on my Nikes
I'll tear that pussy up, I'll tear that pussy up

Di-diamonds and —
Get 'em

Slick Rick, no patch just frames on
Marc Jacobs Aviators and a V-neck
Ten bitches, ten pistols on the P-jet
In a drop top Madina with the top up
I'm in that bitch getting neck like a shot put
Hundred thousand for the grill, if I lie, I die
Flow sick, so sick, see the cyanide
And here's my most funniest joke: I'm broke
Don't worry 'bout me, the money got me
And I keep the burner on me like an I.D
And leave a bitch stuck like a kite in a tree
Weezy F.B., the money is the matter
Hailing from the bottom of the map
But standing at the top of the game
Kush got a nigga looking like I could really use a nap
But I'm still out wildin' with the gang
Got diamonds in my chain, more colors than the Northern Lights
Life is a traffic jam but I'm on a motor bike
Zig-zagging past these bastards, laughing at them
I got them suicidal like the doors on the Phantom
I don't try to lock them down cause I am not an officer
I just knock them down in groups of ten
As if I'm in the lane aiming for bowling pins
Then the style switch so quick
Have you thinking that the disc skipped
Make them bring it back like pass interferance
Speed boat, wife-beater
Ballin' like Derek Jeter for every reason
The same color as sesame-a, diarrhea
The watch nasty like gonorrhea
Money long like Nia, I appear-a via satellite
Whomever don't like the premiere, he a hermaphrodite
Vegetables up in my ear-a, get it clear
And if I ever jump off a pier I would probably fly
Young Weezy in this motherfucker handcuff her
She ain't nothin' but some stairs, I done ran up her
I feel player haters' stares, they ain't sayin' nothin'
They ain't makin' 'nough from jacks, they ain't takin' nothin'
I be wakin' up the ma, we just straight fuckin'
She get a date with the boy, bitch super lucky
And the money stills smell like the stuff
I've been countin' all day, got a hundred paper cuts
Got a, mouth of syrup and a white paper cup
I'm the personal trainer, take the key, shape it up
Got rocks on my neck, nigga get your nature up
Smokin' on that bubble gum got a nigga numb
90 G's each wrist make a bitch cum
I just spent a Maserati on my chain man
So when I'm movin' I just say I'm switchin' lanes man
Made a permanent stain, my name name-brand
I'm a rock star, niggas know the block part
Hard top cars, drop tops as well
Hard work, soft work, chop chop and sell
Cock block hand held, pop pop oh well
Diamonds on my whole chain, flamin' up the whole L
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my neck, dia-diamonds on my neck
I'm smokin' pounds of green, smokin' pounds of green
Smokin' pounds of green, smokin' pounds of green
Hot boy baby, hotter than them other boys
I'm the nigga that your baby mama lovin' on
Spend your child support on the dress and it's coming off

But shawty from Cuba, still workin' on her visa
How she don't suck dick, but expectin' me to eat her?
That ho crazy, man, you don't wanna meet her
But her homegirl Nita swallow cum by the liter
She look good in boy shorts and a beater
But this other girl Quita way sexier than Nita
But I'm a fuckin' freezer, yea, I'mma fuckin' leave her
Smoke like a Cohiba, your ho give me cerebral
Now get low and touch your toes for my people
And if you ain't fuckin' them, then you ain't fuckin' me either
You think your man hot? Well, fuck it, me ether
Heard I got guap, wanna kick it like FIFA
Every day Christmas, cause I'm smokin' that wreath-a (reefer)
Keep a lot of bitches like Queen Latifah
I am southern-land, not Kiefer
Y-M-E for Young Money Entertainment, ha
You want beef? Then my money will arrange it
I am not fuckin' finna aim it
Yeah, Hollygrove, biatch
Sloppy like Joe, you better go get G.I
All my guns knee high, M-O-N-E-Y
College institution, finals and confusion
Stop with your excuses, hip-hop, I am seducin'
Man I'll fuck your girl till her pussy got no juice
See, the problem I got with the game is
There are no gatekeepers in hip hop
I mean, can someone please put a combination lock on the door
And stop giving out the code?
I knew this freak named Tammy from around the way
She used to go to Catholic school back in the day
Now she strippin' in Sue's for a stack a day
I got bitch named Lola, true dick-smoker
Her cousin named Mocha, got a insane spine
But it's crazy 'cause I fucked 'em both at the same time
I even got a bitch in the bay named Jessica
I swear, she might give the best mouth in America
Vanessa got a attitude, but her ass meaner
She remind me of this ho I used to fuck named Sabrina
I only kept around 'cause her ass was amazing
When I cum, they touch tongues and share that nut
On my momma, her head golden like an Oscar
And I met her through Tasha
At the condo she let me fuck her on the washer
September nigga, so you know he nasty
Now, I tell a bitch like this
You gotta take 10 dicks before you meet the president
Young Money!
I know this one honey
I call her track star, cause when we fuck she run from me
My weed real plummy, and real gummy
And my flow is harder than an anvil, honey
Shoot these niggas with the handheld, honey
Niggas kill with me and kill for me
Best believe we ridin' if the fan belt runnin'
Leave a mothafucker just layin' there bloody
I'm from the dirty and I make it rain, damn, that's muddy
She just wanna be my cuddy buddy
And on these tracks I go nutty-butty
Baby?

That she did it before, she probablly didn't go low
So we did it some more and we did it some more
So we did it some more, yeah, we did it til' four

And I know they gon' laugh cause they did it before
Okay

But I wonder if they know that we did it before
If the other girl know that we did it before
That we did it before yeah we did it before
Shit I wonder if they know that we did it before
Okay, a lot of folks don't like to say they did it before
Or if they did it with more, than one, or did it for dough
And just rock with everybody, that done did it before
I know I did it before, you know you did it before
Oh, that's your best friend, yeah, ya'll kick it I know
Ya'll probablly did it before, she probably licked it before

The lost city of New Orleans
But umm, I wanna speak to my city
We can’t be lost for long
And we damn sure can’t be lost forever
So it's time we find ourselves
It’s time to find ourselves, New Orleans
Because memories are everything
And when I say memories are everything
I mean it’s important what you are remembered by
Don’t wanna be remembered as the lost city
I’d rather be remembered of the city that found glory after all that tragedy
Also I built that skate park down there and get them kids off the streets
You’re welcome
But umm, we gotta get up man
Rise above it
So a lot of people ask me
What you gonna do for your city?
I be like motherfucker, you ain’t hear what you just said?

Therefore I still got family members in that city mane
What the fuck I’mma do for them?
You know what I mean?
And I do my best, trust me
And that’s what the fuck I do for my city
That’s what the fuck I do for my city
I do me for my city
So therefore I am remembered by my city
Ya dig?

You broke niggas yea
Pause

And my city hot, ride with the itchy cock
Coupe with the titties pop, motherfuck a city cop
And I got the hater like, when will he stop?
Maybe a minute after never, set ya clocks
I'm a nut case, Uptown my birthplace
They feel me coming like the weekend on Thursday
And when I come up in the building, you already know bitch wet
Bitch wet, bitch wet, fuck now
Hahaha
Yes, um, gloves, draws, socks, tees
All made by Ralph Lauren
No shades, just my eyeballs watching them
Tattoos on top of them
Igloos for watches and champagne for breakfast
I eat rappers and call it pussy for dinner
Yea, ask the paparazzi, I'm in the Maserati
Ridin shotty, bad bitch, Clyde and Bonnie
I call her Kami, that short for kamikaze
She call me Daddy, and never short with Daddy money
I'm never broke, never have a cast on me
Always paid, always got cash on me
I gotta feed, the pockets in my pants hungry
I'mma Phantom hauler, a shooter, not a brawler
And your girlfriend's a determinded Carter caller
Control a bitch and let a nigga hold a bitch
I put her on the corner shit, I let her make a porno flick
She will play the role again, whenever she roll again
Yea, I work her, work her, tell her be my slave
Bitch I'm paid, out my cage, I just Can't Feel My Face

Gettin' swallowed by the Maybach, deep throat, nigga!
I'm about to go Planters
I’m still in my prime, Deion Sanders
We all gamblers, I will not lose
Flow precious as diamonds, I drop jewels
Give me mine or I'mma take mine
Smoking purple, I heard it through the grape vine
Weezy Baby, AKA Your Highness
I just killed this shit, moment of silence
I'm in the zone like a fastball
And I fuck the game up like a bad call
Let the money stack, don’t let the cash fall
Bars all day, no last call
Birdman Jr., wings spread on niggas
Dr. Carter got some lean in your IVs
Strong dry weed, make my eyes bleed
Strong arm rap, I rock an iron sleeve
I’m a dog on the beat, fuck the veterinary
I'm in the zone like college ball
Spit fire like I’m sipping on a Molotov
Loose bowels, this shit is so easy
(I might send this to The Mixtape Weezy)
Hey
I remember da way
We be together
Forever and a day
Well I guess dat day
Cus now
We're apart and away
And it feels so stray
N.G.E. wouldn't you say
Call u bay
And I just wish we could
"do it again" (X3)
Hey
But timing is an error
And I
To you like ever
Given another chance to
"do it again"
Like I died
And gone to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
Died inside of pleasure like
Wow
Your smile is but of essence
Your child is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message
But I'mma try to test it
And scream for a blessing
So loud
And I hope that you would catch it
And one day you would come fallin
Then ill be there to catch you
Ill be there to let you
Do da things
We didn't do before
Next time we have to stretch it
Do it never forget it
I never forgot
I wish dat we could
"do it again" (X3)
Hey
Im just trynna talk to you
If I could talk to you
Den I would talk
Forever and a day
Yes I remember
So vividly
How we would be
When we lay
And my then blue skies
Were no longer gray
She so brightened up my day
Put it on a scripture
If perfect had a face
I promise you homie
Dat u would be hungry like me
If you had a taste
Cus baby girl is a flower
A flower without a vase
No water needed at all
She continues to grow
More beautiful everyday
And I love her somethin vicious
And im just wishin
"do it again"(X3)
Well, alright, I can't feel my face, I'm going first
And my grill is ill
Did I do that?
Throwing up signs, like I'm in a frat
Eagle Street, bitch
And me I keep it funky like pubic aroma
Put em' in a coma
Now what that boy got? Umm, glaucoma (Haha)
My weed is stronger, I smell great
I like promethezine, I'm in a snail race
And my watch reminds me of '88
Because I got crack rocks in the watch face
Bitches stick to me like scotch tape
So icy like a motherfuckin' cupcake
Ya, these hoes feel my feng shui
And wanna eat me alive I'm like an entrée
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing
I does my motherfuckin' thing
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing
I does my motherfuckin' thing, ya dig
Santana bandana on tilt
Back seat with the heat, I'm warmer than a quilt
They lookin at me like they drink spoiled milk
Money tall: Jack and Jill
Like they sittin' on a hill
Ice on the neck of me, ice on the wrist of me
Ice in both hands bitch I'm lit like a Christmas tree
Different color stones you could call it a mystery
Big dookie rope, you would think they was lynchin' me
I pity the fool the day he try to get with me
Fresh Prince, got banks like Hilary
I make the girls run fast like Benny Hill
Rims go round and round you can call them my Ferris wheels
I don't play games I shoot it up like Halo
Got more paper than your job's got payroll
Still I'm ghetto like no frills
I clean the dirt out my nails 100 dollar bills
Cause
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing
Everytime I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my motherfuckin' thang
And everytime I do it, I do my thing
I does my motherfuckin' thing, ya dig
Maine, Raw Dizzy...
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Steppin in this motherfucker live-r than a concert
No these ain't converse
I done got behind a trick
I line em up I knock em down
Ambulance rack em up
Body bag pack em up
White sheets bloodied up
Mean mug your buddy up
Tellin niggas buddy up
I catch em while they huddle up
When the pistol go nuk uk uk
Run up in your girl crib
Now she all like but but but
I ain't tryna hit that shit
Ain't nobody innocent
I ain't wanna hear the shit
I got her with the pillow mint
Know who you dealin with, a full hand of aces, I
And this here, is where the bullshit
Cut off, you NAHMEAN
You couldn't see me with some high beams
Hey
(Chorus: x2)
Don't say it nigga don't do it
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Yea

Cause I does it in my head
Look how I tease the feds
Pink yellow blue diamonds got my PIECE
Mack maine tried to teach me how to count bars
I stack chains that's what keep me outta cop cars
My rap name carry weight like a fat broad
My gat game told you niggas in (? )
I'm so hood when I do it
It's the same mack maine I distribute the fluid
Let it rain in ya veins yea homie we could do it
Got a few up in the trunk and got a few in the muffler
Paranoid when I stare through so paranoid I might
Motherfuckin steal you so don't be in my rear view
Hey
(Chorus: x2)
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Yea
I'm not jokin I'm tryna score a hundred of them
Things just to bust my block open
Glock pokin outta my shirt to stop motion
Seen my cousin get popped and got focused
Plus sometimes it rains too hard so watch where the road is
I hear a lotta hoe shit
Gotta lil something but I'm tryna get some mo' shit
I'm a still thug it out I tell my body's so stiff
Ridin with my slugger I'm feelin kinda bogus with no motive
My main goal is to ball like Lamar Odom
And haul cocaine and use this rap shit as a token
Stress got me smokin a jo' totin a fo' fo' and
Scopin to kick somebody's no' in
Knowin I got a lil son to look after
But I'm a hustler fuck being a good rappa
Don't say it nigga don't do it
I don't do it cause I done it (I done it)
I hustle lotta bread
Cause I don't move it I just run it (I run it)
Don't say it nigga don't do it

Woah
She say, "I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
I saw some pictures of you boo'd up, it looks like you're starting to like 'em skinny"
I say "Girl, you a trip," she say "I might be a trip, but I ain't trippin'"
She say "Watch these hoes, 'cause they leeches like Robin" I say, "No, Robin Givens"
She was sittin' on my lap and you know a nigga strapped, I know she feel it
It's crazy out here, I'm just protecting myself, you know I'm winnin'
She say "I get it, and if anything was to happen to you, I'd be livid"
"You ain't gotta worry 'bout that, I'll kill a pussy nigga, put his head on exhibit"
Come up missing, think they caught a big fish 'til his body come up drippin'
I treat her legs like like a grand opening, smiling while I cut the ribbon
I took a pill, she took a pill, we was chilling, 20 minutes, now we feel it
I said, "It never gets old, thought I'd never say never, but I did it
I admit it, big booty, big titties; I admit it
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back
I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry
Then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble, too
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable
Saw a flick of you boo'd up, boy, you never liked em skinny
You tell me I'm a trip, well, I might be a trip, but I ain't trippin'
Stop actin' like you ain't got no type
Who you kiddin'?
I admit it, I admit it
But I got these guns on me right now
I got these drugs on me right now
I got two buyers, want it right now
She took her clothes off and I stopped
Looked at my watch, like "Fuck it, why not?"
Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out
Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord
She say, "I know you thought that you was about to get a quick fix, hit it, quit it
But you know you ain't been with a good, thick bitch in a minute"
I say, "You ain’t never lying; thought I’d never say never, but I did it"
She said "Speaking of a line, are you finished? All we need is a witness"
"Girl you trippin', young nigga still livin'"
She said, "Who you kidding, boy? you like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"
I admit it, I like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties; I admit it
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got something for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back
I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble, too
Booty on bubble, titties so fuckable

When the levees broke
When the planes hit
What's going on my nigga
You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster
When the levees broke
What's going on my nigga, the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster
They couldn't kill me holla if u feel me
911 survivor, yeah I feel you
Damn, burning buildings, flamed up
They couldn't take da heat so they jumped
A deck of cards with no aces: luck gone
Now everybody screwed like loose nails
I'm like what are we to do with a house with no roof
God, yeeup, now just look in your seat
Black people, white people, all covered in debris, yeaah
When the levees broke
When the planes hit
You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster
When the levees broke
When the planes hit
What's going on my nigga, the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster
Try to keep our head up, and not get fed up (nope)
But it seems like they won't let us live
Yea, and I was told that life ain't shit and this world ain't neither
This is why I scream fuck the world not the people (nope)
People get swallowed like meat, eat
And your president was lying while my people was dying
Help! SOS, somebody save us
Ten dead inside, where our savior
Hate being at my lowest so I choose to get high
High, so high, that my name should be sky
It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's I
I'm the father of New Orleans and I'm a family man
When the planes hit
What's going on my nigga
We holds our heads high after disaster
When the planes hit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster
Take care of Jew Jew and his mom (please)
Take care of little Jah (please)
Take care all the kids (please)
Yeah, lord please keep your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray my soul you keep
And I don't want this world to kill me, but I'm getting so weak
I can't take much more, I just want to be free
Free, they said they knew there was a problem with the levees, and they did nothing (nothing)
Clinton approved the money, and Bush did nothing (nothing)
I'm feeling like what the hell is really goin' on
Planes into buildings, what's next King Kong?
I wish we didn't even have a reason for this song (but we do) Moment of silence for the people that's gone (Shhhhh)
To those restin' in peace, those dead and deceased, soon again we meet (soon)
I'll meet you at the crossroads
Lord, please keep your eyes on me
I can't take much more, I just wanna be free
When the levees broke
When the planes hit
You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
We holds our heads high after disaster
When the levees broke
When the planes hit
What's going on my nigga, the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers
Rolling stocky, kinda brocky on the streets where niggas watch me
If you plotting I'mma prol'ly get to pop at your noggin
I'm a Hollygrove problem, like "Follow me yeah
That's why I'm here, I come to get that scratch
I done been to jail twice and tell them crackers I ain't never going back, huh?
Rode through the city with the metal on my back, huh?
Gave me a shot and I sent several of 'em back, huh?
Gave me some money, they won't ever get it back now
One million, two million, three million: I'm stacked now
No more crack now, it's in the back for now
Just in case she crack down
I never back down, shit bitch, I might react now
Where you at clown? I'm high in the sky

Real niggas know that vision
You motherfuckers know what I'm out here doing

Looking for the boy, the one in the back

Hip-hip, hoo-ray, 20 hard came today
And two large was the pay, and the Coast Guard said it was okay
Bring them barge to the bay

She put packs in her bra, and the keys in the case
If she ever try to skate with the cake, and relocate

Stripper attitude, only money make me move
Dapper dan status, I'm the stunner part two

I'm off the scrimmage line like Emmitt 2-2
I gotta hundred sacks, and a hundred women; French twist
And we don't even talk, we just French kiss, I could never get pinched
Momma only dated hustlers, so I could only commend them
And never roll with a dummy on your hip
Have the judge giving you a run-on sentence
Never that, I keep the gun on for that business
And when I'm not, I'm at business
See that's that, mad business, peep the simplistics
It's Cash Money, nigga, just live it
I'm the real, I'm the authentic, the fact and the truth
It's Jae Millz, brown skin, but I'm black in the booth
And for the green or that white, you'll see red
Then your ass dead, no need for a hospital room or a bed
Just tell his momma to get him some nice threads
So at least he'll be a bitch ass nigaa dyin' in style
He didn't want to look up to me now he gotta look down
Somebody better tell em on these beats I'm a beast
Half-man, half-animal like King on Tekken
I'll wreck him, hell yeah, Young Money is what I'm reppin'
With no speed limits so you can get there in a minute
It's Dedication 3, there's no replacin' we
That's like askin' a group of Muslims where that bacon be
And that amnesia is what my medication be
That's that Amsterdam grade A, I'm smokin' in the Netherlands

Rest in Peace Soulja Slim

Too many prayers for forgiveness
Too many smiles when you hurtin'
Too many thoughts on your mind
All the time, got you nervous

And all these promises, they all bluffing
Water the seed till the soils muddy
Uh, and every holiday you work
And when I have time you be at work
Damn, I guess you're looking for better
But I'm digging in that pussy like i'm lookin' for a treasure
And the feeling don't die if you don't let it, but you don't let it

And I hope you know
You ain't never too alive to die, heh
Listen, I grew up where the people call them people on us
Lost a few homies, and the grief's still sittin' on us
So we got their names written on us
White folks still spittin' on us
And them bitchass police K9's teeth still grittin' on us
But we smoke, ashes still gettin' on us
Older bitches still hittin' on us
I remember well, Beezy rolled a L
Beezy ain't here — Where's Beezy at? Beezy got killed

But now they all rappin', my niggas
So now I must make it happen
So I'mma play the captain, sailboat flappin', my nigga
Happy for my nigga Lil Tagus
'Cause even though we couldn't, the Lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Shit, found his body like a month later
Rest in peace, boy
He was a East boy, and so was Wessy West
He was a good nigga, so I know he blessed
And his daughter is a princess
And I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'mma keep on pumpin' the flow
So if I cry, don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped a beat
My nigga Lil Derek was quick to cop a ki
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
I pray his family and his momma's fine
I think about it all the time, I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
'Cause if my thoughts got to me, I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in the can
Thank God I had dreams of being the man
'Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
Shot him up, face down on the lawn
Not to mention, with his handcuffs on
And the complaint goes on
But nobody do nothing about it
The jail house and the morgue is too fuckin' crowded
And hate is at an all time high
Everybody gotta hate, it's like a fuckin' iPod
Shit, and they tried to burn my Phantom up
But I got my gun license, haha, I got my hammers up
'Cause if they don't kill me, I'mma kill this summer
Yeah, and you can put that on my late Father
Yeah, he might hit me off with a little brag money
But the nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out, I hope he glad for me
But that's why when I see him I acts mad funny
'Cause he's a joke to me
Don't message, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mama, how it's supposed to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope from me
And I don't ever wanna see her mope for me
There is a day that's due for me
But we gon' pray that it's as far as the future sees
You are listening to the future Weezy F. Baby

Yes I'd do anything
(Anything?)
Anything, for you
"It was never my intention to desecrate the flag of the United States of America. I was shooting a video for a song off my album entitled "God Bless Amerika". The clip that surfaced on the Internet was a camera trick clip that revealed that behind the American Flag was the Hoods of America. In the final edit of the video you will see the flag fall to reveal what is behind it but will never see it on the ground. In most people eyes including my own who were raised in that environment, the Hood is the only America they know and the only America I knew growing up. I was fortunate from my God given talents to escape the Hood and see the other beautiful places this country has to offer but most people who are born in that environment don't get that chance. That's their view of their America. That was Dwayne M Carter from Hollygrove New Orleans view of America. That's who I'm speaking for in this song".
Yeah yeah yeah, I got army guns

Yeah yeah yeah, I-I-I-I got army guns

Niggas ain't fuckin' with the boy them niggas softer than satin

Sometimes it feels so awkward
She said because you didn't ask me; I said, "Damn, I didn't think I had to"
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool
And if you like it I love it
If she like it I love it
See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking

And she say when she don't see me, she feels like Stevie Wonder
If you want that purse, skirt, shirt"
She made me cum 100 times
Man, she got that work, work, work
I say you my bitch now, I'm calling you first

See we ain't got much in common, so we don't do that much talking
She watch me take a shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
Then she take off my towel, and I-I take off her blouse
I tell her that that pussy for me, just in case she thought it was ours
And she say cool
Uh, I like that shit

"Pharrell, you a cool nigga. Let me shake your hand. You wear tight pants, you wear black bands, you wear long Vans, crib in the sky and
Nigga, yous a perjuror, you lie in court nigga
You prolly snitchhy snitchy and proly bitchy bitchy
Ridin' through Hileah, ride through Kendall
Ride through Carol City, ride through Overtown
Where they leave dat ass on the ground
But you say that they know you now
But the difference is when dey see ya, will they hold ya down
See P grew up with a heroine pedal?
They made fun of me cause I was a odd fellow
See I was half skate park I was half ghetto
But you cut me open then u seen my bones made of metal
Here's my DNA yes it was essential
Unlike your aftermarket Roley Presidential
Look at my Audemars, three hundred something
Barack inspired (why?) the black one comin'
Pu-Pull up in that new thang all mellow

It took a lil' time it was just a hill climb
And now we at the top so let's pose for the pictures
Cause our money longer than the nose of da bitches?
And, and for my shows do ya know what I'm gettin'?

*Lyrics from Snippets*
Hop on this thing and send me to the moon
You can just hate me, when you know just what to do
Whenever you see me, I be with them goons
We ain't gon' face 'em but we got 'em too
Yeah, water on me like a pool (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bah, in the back (Bah)
Gettin' tens and that bit Guwop (Bah)
'Cause you make it look so good
So easy
She said, "I love you Tunechi," I said I love me too
Bitch, come through, we through
And I'ma go plum dumb in it and we all need fruit
She said, "Babe, you so crazy and I'm your crazy glue"
Because you make it look good, make it look easy
I never come down, I'm too high to see me, hold on
I make it look good, I make it look easy, yeah
I never cool down, I'm too hot for TV, hold on
She make it look good, she make it look easy, yeah
She never come down, she never come easy, no
We make it look good, we make it look easy, yeah
We never cool down, we too hot for TV
Cut all my exes off, higher than cholesterol
Tried to play professor and the bitch take a semester off
Wishing on a superstar, trippy life is too bizarre
When she snort this Loius Vuitton and she keep the new ones on
Life in living color, she the one I spend them blue ones on
And it's right where you belong, girl, he make you Uber home
When he calls she threw the phone, I just cut the music on
Waiting for some Dominos, listenin' to some Commodores
She said, "I love you Tunechi"
I said I love me too
She said, "What you up to, Tunechi?"
I said, "That's up to you"
She said, "I don't want much Tunechi"
She said, "Babe, you so crazy and I'm your crazy glue"
Because you make it look good, make it look easy
I never come down, I'm too high to see me, hold on
I make it look good, I make it look easy, yeah
I never cool down, I'm too hot for TV, hold on
She make it look good, she make it look easy, yeah
She never come down, she never come easy, no
We make it look good, we make it look easy, yeah
Gas you with unleaded, I had to 211, yeah
Now you're too hot for TV, but I tell you don't sweat it
Don't wax or trim them edges, I treat that bush like Reggie, yeah
But I don't smoke no Reggie, I give her Coke, no Pepsi
And her best friend a lesbian and I want more affection, yeah
Been fucking on the legend, the Michael Jackson, Jesse
Lil Tunechi, Elvis Presley, Hendrix, Future, past or present, yeah
I'm too hot for TV, too high for my exes, I'm rated triple x's
Too much drugs, sex, and weapons, yeah
And I'm too high to see me, diamonds shine in 3D
I make it look good, I make it look easy
I get it from Weezy, been too hot for TV
Now bring that big ass over here and come do what we do
She pull up on the kid, she suck my dick and try to kiss it
I told her, "Hold it", call her friends
If they ain't fucking, can't get in
I fuck her on the kitchen counter, drop my kids off on that chin
I tell her face down, ass up, I wear it out like a new trend, oh shit
Fuckin' crack down on the Act
I'm sippin' slow, slow, slow, yeah
I'm a lil freak on my camera shit
I got that Hannah Montana, bitch
Pull out my dick, can you handle it?
Then
She said, "I love you, baby," I said I love me too
She said, "Can I come through, baby?"
Bitch, come through, we through
I'ma go bananas in it, you know we all need fruit
Because you make it look good, make it look easy, yeah
I never come down, I'm too hot to see me, hold on
Make it look good, make it look easy, yeah
She make it look good, yeah, she make it look easy, yeah
She never come down, she never come easy, no
We make it look good, we make it look easy, yeah
We never cool down
Don't I make it look easy?
I could never come down, no
Don't she make it look good?
Then she never come easy, no
We could never cool down
That's some sick shit
Skateboarding these days is going awesome. Umm, new tricks I've landed. Umm, y'all don't really know nothing about that shit. When I say "y'all", umm, I don't mean none of my fans, I don't mean people who don't skate, I don't mean people who do skate. It's just a lil, you know what I mean, it's a skate thing. You run into a skater, he, he or she, they'll run into ya and let you know what I mean. We always think that y'all don't know what the fuck we talking about. But uh, you see how I put myself in that "we", like I'm a real skater? It's all good though, shout out my skaters!
Dope man
Dope man, coke man
Yeah
I got a driver for my drop top limousine
Yeah, he like to talk
She like to talk
So when he drop her off
They have a heart to heart
Guess he got all the answers
And I got all the verses
My Benzo got no ceilings
But the windows came with curtains
Me and G swerve
Popping these Percs like I'm on injury reserve
And when the pockets full of lint, we want that lint to be fur
No baking soda, my nigga, we play it raw
Want you to know it's me nigga, my mask off
Cut out your tongue, put that bitch in a glass jar
Then drop it off to your kid's classroom
Dirt bags, we belong on a vacuum
Long hallways, my room is the last room
Long hard days, my schedule don't have room
You home all day, you stuck on your MacBook
I'm gone all day, I'm chasing that checkbook
And back in the day we was on section eight
Now we in our own section, motherfucker like "Ayy"
Public Enemy Number One like Flav
Fifteen with a mouth full of golds like Flav
Fifteen with a house full of hoes like Hef
Shots take off like a stealth
Letting human heads replace the Grammies on the shelf
Put a bitch head right below the belt 'til she belch
And she won't get a dollar; zero, zilch
Tunechi pass the blunt, I'm gon' need time to study
They don't know who got the gun
But they know who got the money
We don't wanna know what's up
What these bitches want from me?
Bitches claiming I'm a dog
But these bitches want puppies
My bitches bring others
My bitches bring rubbers
Your bitches burn rubbers
Your bitches burn supper
I'm still major and I made you niggas
You getting bodied by a skater nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that be Skypin' bitches
Shout out to all my bitches one nightin' niggas
Woah, make sure you hit 'em with the Slut Walk
And I pour up another one, another one
The cream soda tasting like bubble gum
Woah, straight swerving on these niggas
From Collins, to Highland, to Bourbon on these niggas
Them other niggas just wasn't deserving of me, niggas
No more Family Matters, no more Urkel on them niggas
I'm feeling like a born again virgin on them niggas
I'm running to the bank, quick as Herchel on them niggas
What's in your wallet?
I done went commercial on them niggas
On purpose on them niggas
When we see you, boy, them shots be coming back to back
Long hair, don't care, nigga; Cactus Jack
No Ceilings
I keep the blammer in the drawer with the pajamas
I keep the ammo in the bananas
I treat the randoms like some companions
I got more value than I got failure
I got more flings than I got flair
I don't dream if I do not have nothing to wear
I know you believe, I know you beware
I know she a fiend, and this an affair
If momma a queen, and poppa a bear
You run out of steam, you run out of stairs
I run in Supreme and get something rare
She run to the team, and now she a player
We live on the edge, we die in the air
We sick in the head, but pockets is well
We tiptoe on eggs, we out of our shell
Our vision is red, the eyes are as well
We can't pay attention, we got to pay bills
It doesn't make sense if it's not making mills
We do not take pictures, we're not taking L's
If y'all love to listen, then I hate to tell
If y'all scared to visit, then I take it there
If heaven is real, then y'all fake as hell
Cut off your heels and bounce on your tail
I'm on a mission, survival is real
Man, fuck how I fix it, admire the repairs
I'm talking six but my mind is on twelve
Poppin' prescriptions on top of the hill
I told that nigga, stay out of my hair
She just want to fuck in the throne
Shit get too deep and they dug up your bones
She sniffin' that King and she mix it with Kong
Her clit got a ring, and my dick got a horn
This is what I call a risk and reward
We cutting it close, give the ninja the sword
This shit is sick and it get in your pores
And then you a corpse, and then it's the morgue
Me, I'ma hustle until it's the Forbes
I swore, it was no more than a chore
The house by the water, condo by the shore
I'm sure, I'm all about that manure
Cooler than leather and hot as velour
I'm not the one, when it is war
And I got your tongue, stomp on it once
Then smile at your young, they see I'm having fun
Shit don't get brazy 'til I say go brazy
Run up on your haven and pop at your nasal
Your baby gon' take me straight down to the basement
Gun to the head, she get down to the basics
No dramatization, we popping these gauges
Behind desperation, it's just in our nature
So cold-hearted, perspiration turn to glaciers
Ovations, better be loud and bodacious
And then I'ma take me a bow and be gracious
Throw it in the crowd and then take a pow at the spacious
I'm out of my mazes, I'm out of my cages
I'm out of the labels, I'm kind of escapist
I profit, I praise it, I spend it, I save it
I buy me a nation, you renting on Avis
I'm in it, I sit it, I did it, you said it
You killing, you playing, I'm friendly, I'm faded
I get way too high to get through the hiatus
You look in my eyes and my pupils dilated
I'm true to my ratings, I'm glued to my statements
I just want to dive in the pool of my payments
You runnin' your mouth, seein' how quick you can chase it
The stick is malicious, equipped with a laser
The temperature blazin', the tension is raisin'
You smell the dead once, gotta live with the fragrance
Sickness is real, the meds is too tasty
Keeping it dirty like Sanford and Grady
The Young Mula Baby, I'm back from the 80s
Dedication, sick, shit
My favorite movie quote is "You got 14 bricks in that bag right there?" That's my favorite movie quote. That was Cam talking to, uh you know Mitch and all them, that was uh, damn I always forget the name of the movie and it's my fucking favorite quote but it ain't my favorite movie, but like that's my favorite movie quote. My favorite movie, if you wanted to know, if I ever said it, I never said it, it's Sixth Sense, so don't ask me why, I see dead people, you know what I mean, so I got the fuck away from them dead bitches
Yeah, Drought 3, yeah
Bitch I'm back on my grizzy, Young Money, where you at?
Two tables and a mic, tell the DJ run it back
Bitch I'm back on my grizzy, Young Money, where you at?
Two tables and a mic, tell the DJ run it back, bi- bi- bi-
Cut me up G, cut the music up baby
Bitch I'm back on my grizzy, Young Money where you at?
If you fuck with Young Money, Young Money where you at?
Boy that chopper keep drumming like brrrat-at-at-tat
But I'm a giant, like "Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum"
Just bought a new crib inside Sodom
Got some money put away in case the hurricane come
I'm a fucking shame, huh? Yeah I know, yeah I know
I go out the country to get all my clothes and my hoes
I go out my way just to get my dro and my dough
'Cause I love it more than I love my hoes, yes I does
I got gasoline coming out my pores, I'm a torch
I got glasses like that white boy Scott Storch, and a Porsche
I got license for the scorch, snipers at your porch

Ladies and gentlemen, yours truly DJ Drama. For the first time ever, a one-on-one cypher, a one-on-one battle, two MC's. One has sold over 80 million records, a thousand features, numerous Grammy's and BET Awards, and the other one, hasn't done a goddamn thing. Let's go
Watch your vocabulary, cause I go Conan Barbarian
My watch is like Halle Berry
Man I watched my dad get burried, man I watched my ex get married
I used to pop X with Paris, I made her lay next to Sarah
We used to have sex on camera, I used to pop X and viagra
And act it was natural stamina, double cupping like Pamela
Double up her like a gambler, streetsweeper, I'm a janitor
Y'all weak like a calendar, heh, beyond weak
Yeah, I'm getting close to a billion in arm reach
Yeah, all I could see from my building is palm trees
Heh, we dripping, and y'all weak
I leave your brains right there on your broad cheek
And bloodstains all over your offspring

Hold up, why you flinching slime? Call your henchmen slime
Fiend searching in a haystack for syringes slime
See em tweakin', see em crying, see em limping slime

Hold up, I go hard, like Kimbo, slime
You know my M.O. slime, spit that A-M-M-O, slime

Whoo, you did it to yourself people
Droppa back, 'bout to do it to you people
Uh, that anger's at an all-time high
Yeah, I eat my bread, I'm talking rye
Uh, money coming out of duffel bags
Got the trash bag, dark green
Coming back in different languages and I don't play
Uh, Droppa, Droppa, Droppa
I'm talking 'bout my car, the old one
Matter fact, take the gun, take your son, you better run
Switch my flow up, let me get real serious
Cause when Droppa come hard, I get delirious
I'm not playing, I'm taking it down, come back to my ground
Whoo, Drama, drop the beat twice
Matter fact tell everybody I hate mice, ow, uh
Rodents make me sick, they can kiss my ass
Come back one time, Droppa, first not last, let's go
(Bars)
187 bars in two minutes
It ain't never been done
I did a time, get your money or let your check get you
Disgusting
The Carter is the place

Ain't nobody like you in this bitch
Whoa, fuck them other niggas

Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
You ready?
Ridin' in a mothafuckin' brand new machine, comin' down like a missile
Machine gun to a nigga spine like "Listen"
Nigga listen, don't move motherfucker
And the world is mine like Twism
Its that Carter V, lemme get 'em
I know the whole New Orleans got my back
Get the dirt off my shoulders and clean up my act
This that C5, thank you Jesus, I'm back
'Cause there's only one I, don't remove that eye patch
Man, I got this whole fuckin' world on my back
It wasn't my hands but there's blood on my hands
Watch my fingers make a capital B
I throw gang signs up and don't care where they land
I know the whole 17 got my back
The backbone of my hood, I'm the spleen of my trap
There is death in the air, you might catch a contact
You may need to shorten the lean after that
Man, I swear I drunk so much of lean, I almost passed
Not tryna say I've been clean after that
No more Lil Tunechi, no more king of rap
Life can be gone in a blink of an eye
Oh but don't you judge me, judge the one in the mirror
In your bathroom found a sink full of glass
Just when they thought and they think I wouldn't last
I woke up and I just Carter Cinco'd they ass
We done came this far, I'm so proud of my niggas
I'm around for my niggas, I come...
I'ma just say this shit right here
The greatest mixtape series of all time
Uh-uh-uh-mmmm
Care to debate me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sick shit
I thought so
Keep that shit on Twitter, y'all ain't lit, y'all litter
Watchin' me do push-ups
She was playin' with herself and I looked up, damn
You're plottin' on me, my foot up, uh
Your squad ain't hard, that's cushion, uh
Tunechi across her bosom, damn
Don't name my pistol, I named the trigger
Benjamin Button, push him, bam!
Y'all just pussy, get buried together and let 'em play footsie
Y'all just wussy, I got some bullies gon' pull up in hoodies
And come take a look-see, better play hooky
I got some hookers hookin' up with politicans
And some athletes, and some college niggas
Send your missus on all kind of missions
I'm the sickest nigga skippin' doctors visits
But my pots is pissy, smokin' hockey sticky
Put a stockin' on my face and hit a lick and
When the shit get ugly, I go Pretty Ricky
I don't fuck with rats, neither Minnie, Mickey
I don't fuck with cops, that's the piggly-wiggly
Fuck my bitch's friends, and they friendly-friendly
While your bitch givin' me her twenty-twenty
Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, JC Penney's
I got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winnin', win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to bidness, and we laugh at sentencin'
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artists or starvin' artists
In the kitchen, restaurant, and cafeterias
Better pay the difference to the racketeers
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples
With a throat deep enough to land a missile?
If your nigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now we at his villa aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles
Throwin' pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neither of her friends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than the Simpsons
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrr!
These niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug's Sicilian
You gotta leave your la familia behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got their eyes wide but too blind to see it
With friends like those
Hallelujah, power intruders
Bitch walk around my house like Hooters
Towel user, power user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan
Niggas talkin' out their bowel movers
Turn their homies into flower choosers
Tell a doc that's tryna save your life
And runnin' wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let her partner shoot it, we put out the movie
Win awards, she got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty
These rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
En route to Houston with a contribution
Full of Monster juices, Mazda too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrr!
I got a Greek freak, she call me Antetokounmpo
I'm hotter than soup, she still swallow my soup bowl
I'm out of my loophole, you out of the loop though
Got all these niggas on silent and mute mode
Gettin' the mula by the minuto
Fuck with me, I go Lolapaloozo
Pull up, trigger finger, holler, and pull-o
Hittin' some new notes
And I am the maestro, and you just a typo
I got me a new ho, and now it's a duo
One went to college and one went to ju-co
I had to ask 'em, what's four plus two though? Rrr!
My ultimate basketball dream team
The starting five would most likely be umm
Of course I'ma have to start with Kobe Bryant, umm
This gone take a minute, umm, Chris Paul
Uhh, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James
You already know that's my starting five, I got money on them
Holla at ya boy
Little nigga, I done seen keys bigger than you
Cut off a nigga head, make him suck his own dick
How the game go
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Money over bitches and flowers over snitches
Mr., Mr. Scarface, pistol into yard fish

And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14, I told my mom we will see better days

'Cause if another girl could, she gon' fuck me good"
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it

Your hate don't impact us
Our bitches' dick-grabbers

You just a camera rapper
But we don't point cameras at you
We point them hammers at you
More bullets than hammer dancers
We take the pineapple

Still love 'em all
With a rubber off
Cause they husbands' dogs
And to top it off
All the tops is off
And it's winter season
But the seats is heated
I got a really big regime
Been part of some really big schemes
I just popped a really big bean
I just popped a really big bean
I rock some really big bling
I sleep on a really big king
With a really thick queen
I sleep with a really thick queen
On a really big king
She belt out really big screams
She say I got a really big ting
She say I'm doing really big things
I should be doing really big scenes
On a really big screen
You see, I got really big dreams
And what a grind...
I fuck a clit up on everything
I put some sip up in everything
I put some sip up in everything
No Ceilings
Skinny ass pants, fresh pair of Vans
If them niggas keep tripping they can share an ambulance
My gang popping niggas

Polo Ralph Lauren, bitch, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate
Boogers in the bezel of my watch with the vomit face

Sittin' back, getting head from a mademoiselle (Okay)
Tryin' to put every ghetto kid with a dream in my will (Amen)
Dedicated to you for the 6th time, killed it on the 5th one

While them niggas skipped lunch, I learned how to skip lines
I learned how to kick, punch, power through to get mines
Used to fuck with Sega, my uncle had a pager (chirp!)

Posted on the back blocks, talkin' player-player

Nigga bought a lot of art, and I brought a lot to snort, hey
Beat around a bush, right after we beat the court case
I take off from Earth and take your bitch up into MySpace
I tell her keep her mouth shut, if not, I got some Scotch tape
Got to keep the lock safe, referring to the Safelock
The shelves fall, the ground shake, it make it do the James Brown
I still wear the same crown, light-skin or light-brown
I still dick her right down, hit her with the pipe bomb
Some niggas like to fight crime, some niggas like to fight fair
Some niggas got a iPhone, some niggas had a SkyTel
Some niggas really pythons, I'm watchin' out for myself
Tattoos, black skin, red eyes, blonde hair
Jumped right off the Con-Air and landed on a timeshare
I wear Versace eyeware, feelin' like top shelf
Cool as two Ls and Rock Bells, hot as Scottsdale
Bombshell
Blackin' out, blackin' out

So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide
Guess what, we already did

More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office (Get out)
Young Barack-a Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya

Pockets stay chubby like Toccara
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness
Rock star, flier than an ostrich
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I shall shine forever, never tarnish
Money buried behind my house like a garden
All green, my bank account's like a forest
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me
And chicks, I get 'em high, higher than turbulence is
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious

Its get rich, go to jail or be a murder victim
Ay! Now all y'all listen
I feel like a black Republican, tote the MAC in the public and
Act so southern n' die for my brethren, money
Money, money, like money Mac and publishing
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covenant
Been had cake, you late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politic
But I get all in her mouth like Polident
New Orleans representer to the end. I
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
Wake a nigga ass up like he got somewhere to be
I'm a volcano filled with lava about to erupt again
I stay with the iron, don’t make me plug it in
Stay outta rich kids' business, don’t be buttin' in
I stay with a chick that's ready to unbutton it
My Listerine come out, she start guzzlin'
I’m above you dudes, I’m hoverin'
Juelz, why you duckin' them?, Duckin' who?
I’m in the hood like, “What it do?", comfortable
And believe me, it's nothing to
Send my London boys to English muffin you
You poodles barkin' too much they bringin' muzzles through You ain't gully, you gullible
They need love, they need hugs
They need church, Jesus! Could it be 'cause
They them (Losers), and we us (Winners)
And we up, this is just a sample, yeah, a free drug
The shipment is in, we done re'd up
But, I don’t trust dudes, like a prenup
They cockroaches, they gotta be bugged
I’m ballin' for real, you gotta D up
I don’t hear you boys, you gotta speak up
What are you guys saying?
I have the chauffeur hold the umbrella over my head when it's not raining

Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints

Boy, I expose the truth in lies (Yup)
Cross me and get crucified, no shootin' five
In a sheet like the sheik ridin' through Dubai (Yup)
Game back in a chokehold, the noose was tied (Ayy)
Suicide, it's a suicide
Tell 'em seek and you will find 'cause I'ma lose my mind
It's do or die, I come from where we used to crime
The Uzi 9 more important than school supplies, the pools is dry
The pigeons is too spooked to fly, the rules denied
All the toughest goons is mine, that's Tunechi's slimes
They kill you and go do the time, we unified
Young Money revolutionized the new design
We had to leave the flukes behind and supersize
The numbers through the roof and sky
Don't look too surprised, look through the lines
We makin' moves and strides, grooves and vibes
I'm too alive, these hoes need to be supervised
She get dick and an Uber ride, number two with fries, I'm pimpin'
Now, who am I? I'm who and why
I'm rude and kind, my cars are computerized
I'm cruisin' by, smokin' blunts Ruben size
You fools can try, these tools getting utilized, you euthanized
Brrt, skrrt, shoot, then drive
Now, who survived? We comin' back to rewind
I'm usually high, sippin' on the Houston wine
Feel humanized, I want my throne to recline
Jackie red, Julie blonde, they Cuban fine
I bruise they spine, I leave and they snooze 'til nine
Superglued to the grind, my crew my tribe
These bitches try to divide, we too divine
Got the drugs to provide the coolest highs
The greenest green and the white with the bluest eyes
The syrup and the juice collide, the two combine like suits and ties
Magic, poof, goodbye
Smoke good weed
Yeah, them boys back around
Bitch, we ride, then fire
It's do or die
Smoke good weed
It's bloody mary if you fuck with me
Yeah, them boys back around
Bitch, we ride, then fire
It's do or die
Smoke good weed
Bitch I'm Mack Maine
And this Young Money
Lil brotha get 'em
Done what I shouldn't did what they say I couldn't
Hid where all the killers hid at
Hung where the other hustlas slung at
Waiting on the get back
Get that
Now you niggas is slowing up fast
If I tell 'em you niggas is holding up cash
Rollin up stepping outta the phantom's ass
Put cha litters away ur talking to a can of gas
There's nothing to say no matter who comes to ask
And murder ain't funny but we do love to laugh
Take a nigga bitch and fuck her
And send her back wit nothing
Give him back his sista give him back his cousin
Yea, go make a stack or something
Go and buy yourself a spine and give back the frontin'
Yea and to end that discussion
I been had strength I just got the muscle
I see my people struggle wish that they wasn't
The government try to put us in a muzzle
But you're two fingers ain't the pieces to da puzzle
Shit say to each his own hustle
And I hustle all night and then go home to the fussin'
Hawaiin punch tastes like robitussin
A nigga jus livin jus breathin jus puffin'
Come on mama drop down and curl up
Aye senorita we cannot go any further
Hungry ass niggas I tote two hamburgers
Who want beef? Who want beef? I bring it to your front door and now you seem nervous
Two seater swervin'
Traffic to hell wit it
Shit you can't die with it can't go to jail with it
Might as well wild in it passin and feelin' it
Me I excel fishtail and tailwhip it
Give them niggas somethin' to tell them bitches
Smellin like money at a full court scrimmage
The fam at the table got a four course dinner
Young money cash money dump confetti on da winner
And yo platoon can't handle the destruction
Hard body baby killin' sound like seduction
Them niggas chase dope bitches follow the instructions
Sometimes you gotta put the whole rooster in the oven
So tell the public I'mma do my thing
Just as soon as I hear dat bing
Gotta come in
Comin' up
And runnin' up'll get you in that wheel chair forever
It's whatever

If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah
And I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'
I-don't-give-a-lovely-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing, no matter where you going
You don't need a bus pass for me to bust yo ass, nigga
Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside, MOB Piru Damu
I'm a blunt-blowin', Polo-drawers-showin'

Damn, and if the red dot spot 'em then the hollow head got 'em
Knock his top to his bottom jack
Yeah, you see we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom at the very bottom of the map
Lil Weezyana piranhas everywhere you at
You gotta wear ya extra condom and a extra gat
Your bitch can get it for actin' like a man
And niggas in Pakistan ain't packin' like your man
I backwards hand your man on command
In front of niggas he cool with them boys on fan
I'm on hot, I adjust in different climates
Ducking the animal keeper runnin' with my primates
You ain't did it till you done it like in five states
Weezy hustle no blubber I put on weight
And in the drought I go on a diet and stretch more
Lose all that weight leave a nigga with stretch marks
You don't even come up to a nigga chest pa' sub par
What the fuck they play it in the club for
Real shit I'm ducking bombs from a drug war
No religion but the cops swear that I'm a drug lord
Father forgive me if I have to send em to you Lord
They ridin' up highway to heaven boulevard
Damn, them niggas pussy and jive
Not even in a eye exam, they ain't lookin' for I
The A and the K will make your face crook to the side

Sweet potato-ass nigga, you lemon merengue, apple custard
Cherry jelly, don't make me get the biscuit busta

And niggas keep they ways when I'm in the streets wit blay What!
My nigga hungry he'll eat the plate
And though he got me, you can ask I'm like a pool table

Flip your vehicle, split your windshield
Whack ya baby momma but I'll let the kid live
And people say that I am a kid still

Cash Money Records nigga, Life After Raw
Captian hard I got that hard white
Weezy F. Baby ho word it right
Homie spit cool bars like Klondike

Curt Schilling how I pitch the powder, in a mist of riders
Still sending kites to lifers

Young nigga tuned up like Midas

Smoking like a tug boat

I don't fuck with young hoes
This shit is a blood sport
We shoot you in your muscles
And leave you like a puzzle
AK-47 and the nina has a couple
Numbers don't lie I shoot you a hundred times
Long hair don't care
Bitch it's Weezy not Rapunzel
I'm on these trees bitch swinging in the jungle
And I was born there like Tarzan
I was dealt the hard hand
But now they call me Starzan
And I just pop the bar exam
Penitentiary flow my bars hard
Too hard for a cell mate
So all these other fucking rappers to me ain't nothing but a jail bait
Too much coke make the skill shake
It's Lil Tune aka Jim
That's what they call you when you sell weight
The feds watching with a stale face
The hoes watching with the Yeah face

Lil Wayne tattoo face
Bad bitch with a cute face

Tell 'em, yeah, bah
Sound like a T-Rex live under my hood
Gotta know the Tec live under my seat
Put you in the ground, now you live under my feet
And you better put the 'O' in front of my 'G'
The bullshit they talking doesn't come to my knee
I'm like a linebacker, don't run it by me
My two best friends will accompany me
And right now they are in my dungarees, sleep
One named Mack, one named Nina
They hit you, make you do the Macarena
Where your tool? You gon' need it like a mufucker
Tec's, AK's, I leave the scene ugly
Chest, head, face, arm, leg, stomach
'Cause I got my thang, my thang, my thang
And that bitch go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
You hear them guns, like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
They know I keep that toaster, you can be my Pop Tart
I never had height, but boy I got heart
And I ain't gotta speak, I just let my car talk
Hard hat? No, but I got the tool on
And you should be my paper if ever the tool's drawn, yeah
Flow retarded, when I spit I get my drool on
I don't rap, I just shit like a newborn
I don't write, I just spit like a tooth gone
So tell them haters "cut it out" like a coupon
How come that chopper sound like a nuke bomb?
Little nigga, gotta hold that bitch with two arms
I'm on your heels like a shoe horn
Tec's, AK's, I leave the scene ugly
Chest, head, face, arm, leg, stomach
Cuz I got my thang, my thang, my thang
And that bitch go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
I gotta place my rearview when I pull in the parking spot
'Cause where I'm from all the young niggas die in the parking lot
Get ten seconds on the news, they barely talk about us
You gotta watch the way you move, they'll make a target outcha
Oh, the Reaper comin', gotta keep it on me
I told my momma I won't leave her lonely
Too much drama, get these demons off me
We still at war, I got that thing in arm reach
Fuck what happened
That's what my momma told me when they caught me with a ratchet
Rather see me in a cell than see me in a casket
I show love to all my fans 'cause I prevail through all this rapping, whoa
I feel like I let 'em down and that's word to Lil Snupe
Know they'd kill me in my hood, but I just keep on comin' through
Still wit' it, the graveyard throwing a party for all the real niggas
When everybody want me to get out we gotta deal wit' it
I seen some things I could never forget
I just wanna ball a hunnid summers
Seen too many of my dogs goin' under
Grew up 'round them monsters they'll shoot you in your face
Live by the sword, die by the sword way
Tried to make it home, they shot him in the hallway
Tears on my face feel like I be cryin' blood
Momma won't see her son again, we call that blind love
I can't trust these niggas, they'll get you lined up
You gon' be a killer or a homicide
Make your momma shed a tear before my momma cry
Only God can judge me when I clutch and let that chopper rock (Brrr)
I wrote this in blood, this some of my realest shit
They say if he rich as fuck, why he movin' so militant
'Cause in my hood it ain't no love and I know what I'm dealin' wit'
As I walk through the valley of the shadows of death
I did some things that I had to regret
I just wanna ball a hunnid summers
Seen too many of my dogs goin' under
How I made it out alive, sometimes I wonder
'Cause we been goin' to war since Contra
If he don't hit it right shawty you can call me
See I know what to do with all that in them jeans
He got a little swag he ain't nothing like me

36-24-36
And girl I really need to know what's up
I’ma chase my dream
High definition to get what's forever given
But nothing was never given, I build it from ground up
I started out with my basement and builded my house up
I’m rich off opportunity, money gon’ pile up
My swag on a hundred mil', how the stylist gon' style us?
Caught up in the light, caught up in the life
I see youngin on the corner with a quarter of that white
He just tryna chase his dream plus his daughter needs some wipes
World full of problems, ain't nobody gotta answer
Mommy in the grave, daddy gettin’ high
Bills steady rollin’ in, he barely gettin’ by
Same clothes everyday, he barely gettin’ fly
What that is? Chasin’ dreams, time is tickin’ so it seems
On his downtime he’s spittin’ and he’s sick, his flow is mean
He just want his real chance, no reality show
But the graveyard the jail cell, reality though
Crack house was his crib, the streets fathered him though
Woah
Dream chaser, keep chasin'
Grind will turn into your shine, be patient
Yeah, hundred miles and runnin'
Tryna catch up to my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin'
Dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Uh, I was raised by my momma, pop used to beat her
Got a sister my age, my pop was a cheater
Gram's kept something in the pot for us to eat up
Had to open up the oven for the house to heat up
Christmas missed us, no birthdays or Easters
Used to snatch bags from Halloween trick or treaters
Hot dogs and beans, fish sticks on the weekend
Shared the same bed that my cousin used to pee in (ill)
Black and white on top of floor model with no cable (uh)
My sister used to punch me, beat me, slap me
Raised in South Phil', 2-4 where you can find me at
Used to kick the machines for quarters out the laundromat
Dirty little teen, going to school embarrassin'
Grind will turn into your shine, be patient
Yeah, hundred miles and runnin'
Tryna catch up to my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin'
I'm a dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser
It all started in the basement, me, my pen and my pad
Was broke as a joke, ain't never laugh
I woke up and went and got it, and now they forever mad
When just a year ago I was the same one
Them dudes you call your homies be the main one
But I ain't worried, discouraged, I just observe it
When my dreams started to crumble, niggas deserted
Empty courtroom when my judge read my verdict
Sittin' in my cell, watching my dream
Fade like Mike, fourth quarter, tie game
Shackles on my ankles and wrist, my first chains
And now it’s hard work on the menu, I thirst cream, I'm a
Dream chaser, keep chasin'
Grind will turn into your shine, be patient
Yeah, hundred miles and runnin'
Tryna catch up to my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin'
Dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser
I’m the best ever. I’m the most brutal and most vicious and most ruthless champion there’s ever been. There’s no-one can stop me. I’m Alexander, he’s no Alexander. I’m the best ever. There’s never been anybody as ruthless. I’m Sonny Liston. I’m Jack Dempsey. There’s no one like me — I’m from their cloth. There’s no one that can match me. My style is impetuous. My defense is impregnable, and I’m just ferocious. I want your heart. I want to eat his children. Praise be to Allah!
Yeah!
Gangsta Gri-zillz!
It's a lot of bad bitches in the building, amen (Amen)
Came in the game killing niggas, J-Lin
When it comes to whips, I'm on some shit
I'm probably eight in (Woo!)
Y'all niggas come out (Come out), all the hoes stay in (Stay in)
Every time I come out (Come out), movie in the making (Yeah!)
Realest nigga in it all you got to do is say it
If a nigga rap dissing, when I see him I'mma spray him
Like bang, nigga it ain't no game (Game)
Philly niggas ain't the same, step in your lane (Lane!)
Before that chopper hit your brain stay out the frame (Frame!)
Cause when I let it bada-boom, that's bada-bang
Rollie on my wrist cost a Camaro, yeah, the double-S (Hater!)
Ever since I made a milli, I ain't been in trouble yet
Hundred stacks, hell yeah, hell yeah, fucking right
Y'all niggas was sleeping on me, I was really up at night
Tryna chase my dream, now I ball out the team
Man, I lean off of this Phantom (Skrt!)
"I'ma Boss" my anthem (yeah)
MMG my clique, that's why your bitch all on my dick
I got thirty racks in my pocket, I keep thirty shots in my clip
I get thirty racks for my verses, y'all don't get paper like this
I'm getting money, must be Illuminati
I be with some Philly niggas, they just trying to shoot somebody
Tell 'em (Tell 'em!), I swear I tried to tell 'em (Tell 'em)
Lampin' in this penthouse, I started from the cellar (Cellar)
And if she want that hammer all up in her I'mma nail her
Word to my nigga, Ricky, we gon kill the game this summer
Ahh!
He said he know a pussy nigga with a hundred bricks
So we gon' ride up on em, slide up on em with them sticks
Finna pop up at his crib like a fuckin' magic trick
Hocus-Pocus, to the safe like you ace nigga open focus
But this ain't Calvin niggas, ridin' like a locomotive
Pussy ass niggas man it's tax season
Act decent, bet them hollows leave your back leakin'
Niggas searchin' for the coca like we crack feignin'
Young niggas gettin' greasier than Vaseline
Had a dream, I'mma chase it with this Mac machine
Put a nigga on the cover of a magazine
Home invasion, news paper got a man down
Hold this nigga legs, I'mma tie his hands down
Let em taste it, just to know we ain't playin' round
He ain't gotta get up on your knees, nigga head down
Blocka! You fuckin' with a shotta
I'm bangin' 2Pac, "My Ambitionz As A Ridah"
And we gon flush everything if them boys get behind us
'Cause we ain't comin' home, I'm in another zone
Ridin' with my dogs, we just want another bone
I ain't gettin' to the money, nigga, then there's something wrong

I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
In a matter of time I spent on some locked up shit
See my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please before them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lionhearted
They love me when I was stuck and hated when I was departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawling, went straight to walkin' with foreign cars in my garage
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
Lil' nigga I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga I'm fly-er
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Phantom so big, it can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas then what you talkin' bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve fuck nigga
Hold up wait a minute, y'all thought I was finished?
When I bought that Aston Martin y'all thought it was rented?
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
I'm the type to count a million cash then grind like I'm broke
That Lambo, my new bitch, she'll ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hands strapped around my toes
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around get killed
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke
All I know is murder, when it comes to me
I got young niggas that's rollin' I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOAs I done did the KODs
Every time I'm in that bitch I get to throwin' 30 G's
They like, my nigga back home that young nigga be wildin'
We young niggas and we mobbin' like Batman and we're Robin
This 2-door Maybach, with my seat all reclinin'
I'm that real nigga what up, real nigga what up
If you ain't about that murder game then pussy nigga shut up
If you diss me in yo' raps, I'll get your pussy ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA, at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet, like that little engine I could
Boy I slide down on your block, bike on twelve o'clock
And they be throwing deuces on the same nigga they watch
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still calling them shots
And these lames talking that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
And these niggas hating on me, hoes waiting on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money have ya friends turn into enemies
And with these beef I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go from 40 ain't no 10 a key, hold up
Broke nigga turn rich, love the game like Mitch
And if I leave you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was something 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
I'm gone
Woo
Ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, "Yeah, I do"
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches ménagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga!
Maybach Music
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
That Lambo my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' 30 G's
But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins (Skrrt)
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin' (Let's go)
I'm like, "Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?"
If you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
Boy, I slide down on your block (Block), bike on 12 o'clock (Rah)
And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)
And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money, have yo' friends turn in yo' enemies
And when there’s beef, I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key
And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone
Woo!
(Snippet)
Yeah
Young nigga started with oodles and noodles, now we eating lobster (Ah)
As I walk through the valley with my ladder and flex
I'm the realest nigga in it I just happen to rap
When they all thought we was finished, they was laughing at that
So I went and bought me a [??] and flip they ass to the back
Fuck 'em, new jewelry, new whips on the way now
Brr, brr, that's yo bitch on the way now
Mama told me if you fall, never stay down
Stand up nigga, I can never lay down
Wins and losses, it come with being bosses
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us
Take that shit to trial if the feds making offers
Lil' bitch, you don't call me lil' fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out, I'm still lit
Streets calling and they said they was some real shit
Young bull looking like he in a real lick

I went from standing on them corners, jumping on them flights
Middle of the jungle no strap, ice on
Niggas pussy in the dark, let's turn them lights on

Rest in peace to Mike, I rest in peace the mic

Its levels to this shit, dog you won't believe my life
62 Maybach, I can barely park the shit
Got these rappers scared see em' shaking like it's Parkinsons
If they said my name they got flamed, I'm the arsonist
A man don't eat he gonna starve, a man gonna starve he gonna die
I know that they gonna try, that's why I stay strapped with a brand new mac and it's 45
So when they jump fast, better whistle like off-sides
Cause I'm from Philly, we'll eat your cheese steak
I told Diddy, I ain't walking for no cheesecake
Cause the jeweller making the band with the freeze face
Lets talk about the time when I use to go through it
Nappy ass braids, with the cold shooters
We was playing with razors before they had the little scooters
Shit I walked in with my Pumas on, you ain't even know it
These a million dollar pair of sneaks nigga, you ain't even know it
Said Reebok dropped Ross, we ain't even know it
Cause he went and brought that Bentley Brookland, he ain't even show it
At 21 I wanted to pop a bottle
At 22 I wanted the hottest model
At 23 I wanted the Rolls-Royce
I hit my hood, niggas looking fucking sour

Tell 'em that I'm strapped, I don't wanna rumble
Fuck being humble, fuck being humble
Lyrics from Snippet
...wake up and get off a lick, oh, yeah
Bitch, your Rollie fake, it's cloudy in the face
All I worry 'bout is money and the drip all day
Ridin' rich, all a nigga do is Crip all day
R.I.P....
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
First of all I wanna say is free my nigga Lil
And free my nigga Rick
And just thoughts of doin' life gave a nigga chills
Damn, long rise to the mountains
I heard a nigga soul make you wanna cry fountains
But you can't
So much pain can't explain it or pronounce it
And daydreamin' on the day you make it home but never knowin'
When them crackers gon' let you free
Take off them chains and just let you be
You know you get appeal
So many laws lie fumbled in the field
Turned over to the system either that or they was killed
Man I dont hustle cuz I wanna shit I have to
I fell in love with the streets I lost my dad too
At a early age, man I was doin' shit to lead me to a early grave
Or put me in the cage
Cause I ain't know that the world turns slow
And time flys by you fast tryna ride til you crash
I said I couldn't pick a side good or bad cuz bein' bad felt good and bein' good ain't the cash
Runnin' in the streets got my mama goin crazy
Hangin' out south philly where my daddy ain't make it
To catch a nigga slippin like a taurus transmission
Man listen, the streets that I come from black
A nigga take one of your's then you come to him strapped
Squeeze the trigga and let all of em off
See look you got the fiends on the corner
Lookin' like zombies
Youngin' he was only 19 he got hommy
Yesterday they left him in the streets brain soggy
Ride or pride live by the gun
40 On my hip (8X)
Get hit with all of that, they be like dat's a flamer (4X)
Go 'head nigga, get hit with all of that
They call that ambulance, see your body, den call 'em back
Like call the coroner, that nigga dead
I paint the pavement wit your blood﻿, blue purple, burgundy red
The nigga's talkin' reckless, they scared
All 'em south gangsta's, they cowards, and call the fed's
How ya'll niggas gonna go against me, the whole north-side know that I'm G
To get a pass, you gon' need a ID, to come through
Pussy nigga lookin' sideways like he don't like me
'bout to get aired to the max, like Nike
Nigga shootin' from a block away, and don't incite me
If they wasn't through me, jus' tell 'em come walk up to me
I put a little in to make more
OT moving circle like connect four
I'm really in the mix been around vets
Out Pittsburgh killing them 40 right in the jects
Now Bucky got them P's for the low
They cost 11 5 take a dollar if its slow
I never been a fraud do no fronting for a ho
And when that beef occur all my niggas know is go
I been around a while some niggas will say I'm good
I charge you for a verse don't tell me I'm Hollywood, I'm good
Connect dealing with more squares than tiny [?]
I bet it spin him back, get hit all of that
Hit you with that 40 make you do the Macarena
And my watch it be on bling bling
Clean thing, I be on my fresh up on the scene thing
Sevens on my ass and my feet the [?] thing
Ching ching, all I got is money on my mind
Bing bing, I got hollow claps up in my nine
Its the same thing, I be on my grizzy on my grind
And I throw them shots until my biscuit on recline
Just to send a message fuck around and kill your son first
I am the definition of danger
Get hit with all of that they be like that's a flamer
You ain't living how I live sucka
That's why I flex on niggas they never did love us
I'm putting checks on niggas even my kid's mother
And you ain't real if you gon' let them kids suffer
Niggas killed your cousin and you ain't did nothing
I could murder these niggas like I'mma win something
But they don't make war for that
There's friends with double edge knives putting swords to back
Velour is black, Balenciagas on I'm strapped
And I don't party in them clubs where informants at
And they plotting with they people they whispering
It don't get no realer
Sixteen with a body he a killer
Running around with a stick like Donatello
Man these niggas out to murder for that chedder
Hommies killing hommies over fiend paper
Hommies killing hommies over leaned paper
There should be the real nigga Grammys
Where we buy  Rollies and treat them like trophies
You'll never understand me
You ain't come where I come from
Niggas on Xannies, mommy on crack how we going to feed the family
Might as well start selling it, everybody inhaling it
Young, black, and intelligent what they should have been telling us
But they was locking us in a cell with a stranger for them to raise us and wonder why we rebellious
Niggas going through pain
I was missing from school cause I was going through things
Niggas driving me crazy they threw it all for the fame
Knocking down schools in my city to bring a prison 'round
They killed Chinx Drugz in his own city
They killed Lil Snupe in his own city
Wonder why I don't be in my own city
Still living lavish and they still wonder why I act savage
All these guns and automatics
Still gonna murder these niggas that want to have it
Fuck y’all niggas that killed Lil Snupe
And when we run into y’all niggas we gone kill y’all too
I still pray every young nigga feel that coupe
Cause young niggas feel like me, I feel like you
Fifty shades of grey, want to do me like Freddie
I pray to god, load my chopper, tell them niggas I’m ready
Summertime nights out and we bring them bikes out
You could turn the lights out cause we got all this ice out
We up in here serious going crazy
Young boys getting to the [?]
Looking at the media they say I got a baby
On the way by Nicki I'm thinking the media crazy
Young nigga getting to the money
Dreams Worth More Than Money it ain't funny
Then I bought a Rolls Royce cause I came up from the bottom they ain't give me no choice
Judge gave me five months in jail, felt like I was in Hell
Twenty three I was in the cell
Sorry your honor if I was too arrogant, that money was staggering
They locked me PC with them trannies and rat, man that shit was embarrassing
Twenty three hours in the cell by myself, man you couldn't imagine it
Can you imagine me losing my mind
Doing push ups 52 at a time
Do the whole deck just to get through the time
Just to get back to my son and get back to my mom
Cause Papi keep asking me where am I at
I told him in jail and I said I'll be back
He said when you back can you get me from school
We live fast die from gun shots
And in this lifestyle we sling dope, bust Glocks
Why you think we say fuck cops
Cause when they lock us up all the fun stop
And when the ice cream truck come it wouldn't stop
So for them little babies all the fun stops
Waiting on the state bus 'til the cuffs lock
They put shackles on us like jewelry we say fuck rocks
Cause all we ever wanted was to sell blocks
To get a little real estate to sell blocks
And try to turn to God when these cells lock
Have mercy on me touch down catch a case trying to sell rock
And we didn't want to believe that Hell's hot
My mom told me you might as well stop
Cause you can't ride your weight when the wells drop
And your shit stank smell like mildew
In the kitchen like grandma
When it come to getting this money fuck everything no playing time
If you real nigga you can't mind
Real niggas we can't die
I used to pray to God to get a brick nigga
Prayed to God to be a rich nigga
Timing is everything
I love all my niggas and my family is loyal
I'm buying them everything
Put Papi through college and everything
I go out of my way to go out of my way
I give my momma a thousand a day
Like Benihana's we chopping the weight
Cause we get that work put the profit away
How would you feel if you came up from nothing and one hundred mil just a comma away
My youngins got youngins that got in the game
Cause we was out trapping when doctor was Dre
Rollie diamond the face
Hold up, look how I just took this bitch take her straight to the mall have her shopping away
Hold up, what you want some red bottoms
Balenciagas [?]
Shit I'm about to get some head out her
I have her twerking for a nigga that's cardio
I could kill all these rappers on audio
Pick it up I forgot how that go
None of you niggas put fear in my heart, we only fear going broke
And none of you niggas put fear in my heart, we cut your head by the throat
Never would hang with you suckers and rats, unless its a chair and a rope
Million dollar dreaming, really I was scheming
Feeling like a [?] when I'm off the lean
I said why you talking we don't back and forth with niggas I feel like I'm Venus
Nigga I fill up arenas, get on my level
I heard you say you running the city and seen you in traffic and niggas was walking
Nigga is you hating cause you mad, are you mad cause you hating
Cause you staying on them days I ain't waiting for debating
I'm just getting to that money
I'm just getting to that mula
Everywhere you see me at I keep a shooter on
I be on some shit in fact
Caddy [?] like Reynolds Wrap
'Bout to put some duces on it like I'm playing [?]
And I could hit the mall and tell them give me that
Different color hippie clothes
Want I'mma grab it off
Even let my bitch stunt
Gucci hat sandles on
Even got the bag for that
Switch the flow matter fact
Hold up when I roll up
Got them haters like you know what
He ain't stunting he just fronting
I'm like man that ain't 'bout nothing
Got that Flamers on the way 3
Movie deal coming I'm about to be a millionaire
Only still a youngin I ain't even 25 yet
And I'm a fucking bomb threat
Niggas ain't no contest
Forty-five compact, with the extender
Hollow heads chop a hater down like timber
Catch me in the cranberry Camero, racing down the boulevard
I drop a bird in the street and make it do a somersault
North Philly Mike Knox Meek Milly
Getting so much money that these haters want to kill me
Watch like a gentleman
Who that in my passenger seat, oh that's my lady friend
I only do 8 or 10's, 7 when I'm on my dick
Me and Prada got her, baby girl got body [?]
Then I send her back to the lobby, pimping is just a hobby
I'm limping cause I'm a G and my is so green
The stripper just can't believe, I'm throwing it in the air
Its everywhere like leaves the Rosé on me
Inside we thirty deep, too much for the VIP
My bracelet all [?] my hands stay in her weave
I'm going just like the breeze
Aye Meek you know what I mean
How these niggas like me now
Is this what they want

Street banger nigga

Haters talkin' dirty bout' the kid we ain't buying
Bitches throw the pussy trynna fuck me, where the condom at?
See I'm zeeming trynna keep my semen I ain't down with that

And my goons be wishin' for me get a nigga buried

Niggas sleepin' on you cause you softer then a pillow
Cold pussy talkin' reckless like a killer and em this all for the bitches

Fuck y'all be at? I mean...

You know what they gon' tell 'em Drama

How my mom gone pay the bills when these jobs ain't hiring?
Metal keep firing, the hood's getting tiresome (x2)
Tryna feed the kids, the narcs striking us like lighting
My young boy 17 took a 20 to 40
By the time he do that 20, my youngin' be 40
Called me yesterday, told me he pleaded, they caught him
Couldn't beat it, co-defendants was telling our lawyer
I don't spit for the kids, spit it how it is
Why would I tell you something different? this is how I live
How I came up junkies shooting their brains up
Niggas letting them things bust all over the same stuff
Heard the nigga killed my dad still walk in these streets
So what the fuck you think gone happen he walk into me?
Walk into murder, Glock walking the 33
Cause when that nigga kill my pop it's like he murdered me
Upstate nightmares dreams of getting rich
All they hustle for is clothes tryna to get a whip
These young boys think you good if you get it brick
And how you gone feed your kids if you got a bid?
But I can't blame them its the same shit that I done did
Be the ones close to you wanna do the most to you
On some Rico shit, my nigga's 21 and got the Rico hit
For the love of the green and the American dream
For the love of the money seen hysterical things
Niggas will serve their own moms if she ask for a beam
Flamers Haha drama I got em I got em beast

Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Every month got me pissin', fuck around with them papers
So I can't smoke no kush, I can't smoke no kush
But I ran through them hoes, and I ain't talk 'bout Reggie Bush
I say y'all fuck niggas so fold, hoes ain't never gon' look
In the kitchen with that pyrex and a 9 piece, let me cook
Now hold up, I went and bought a Phantom cause I wanted to
And now I drive the same one some stunnas do
Real nigga, 100 proof
I'ma need a 100 M's to make me comfortable
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
All I know is just flex, shittin' on my ex
Bad hoes on my team, dick 'em down like Next
I rock YSL so fresh, fly as hell no jet
She say I'm cocky, I say that's not me
She call me papi and I say ven aqui
Wrist wear on hockey, Porsche box like Ali
My sneaks they bally, in my hood I'm prolly just rollin 'round in that ghost
Watching out for them folks
Heater on my hip, trunk full of that work
I say my shooters like Dirk, 10 racks and you murk
I put that on yo head nigga, first week and you dead nigga
I bottle pop, I model pop
Pull up on them bikes, let the throttle pop
Niggas know I'm nice, and I got a lot
Like fuck yo corner, I buy the block
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a 100 racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I don't chase no bitches, I just chase my dreams
We ridin' 'round so dirty in this whip that's so clean
My old head, she 30 but that dick suck so mean
And that pussy just so good for that pipe, she my fiend
On that pint I just lean, perk got me bent
If you ain't talking 'bout money, you ain't got no sense
Smell it on my clothes, work got that scent
In that kitchen with them birds, 'bout to serve up that's din' - Hold up!
OZ's and whole keys, straight white and no trees
Great white and OZ's and they might just OD
I stay tight with OG's, they know I'm real nigga
Pocket full of them racks and my bank account, Meek Mill nigga
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a 100 racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
I can see it in their face that they want me to fall
Cause all the little bad bitches I be fucking them all
I want this shit forever
Haters tried to take my life and stop my heart but I'm too clever
Kill me never
Haters trying to prosper
They just want to be me but couldn't see me with binoculars
Rapping ass niggas built for T.V. need an Oscar
First name strongest, last name stronger
Flow so cold listen to it catch Pneumonia
Diamond studded yellow Breitling
The face blue and yellow like Melo
And my chain multi-colors looking like its frozen jello
Hello, steady eating money for a meal
Drinking Rosé for a beverage
Let me get some leverage
When I was locked down I was million dollar schemin'
Rolls Royce dreaming
Hungry like its Ramadan I'm dining
And I ain't mug-meanin' but God keep me breathing
Nineteen years old in the hole
Watching my dreams shatter and praying that all of my goals
Don't fade away like fourth quarter pass to 23
For all my real niggas
For all my niggas that ain't here
For all my niggas that's down right now
Now this one is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas
On the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas
And this one is for my young niggas
On the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas
Just bring your all and get these ones niggas
When I cry, I cry real tears
For all my niggas locked and got life years
I'm on my grind all the time this the last year
We gon' starve flea on dog
There's no limit to what I do, I'm Master P on guard
For that relish green like the Celtics nigga we ball hard
I ain't trying to be the hottest I'm trying to get my mind straight
Tweety school private, a million dollar bank account
Cruising on the island, tricking bitches
Reminiscing how we used to wild 'em
Play the game foulin'
The water ain't deep 'til you swimming with piranhas
The hood no good everybody think they riding
Until you catch them slipping put some shit up in they noggin
They rather see you shot up before they see you pop up
The chain around your neck all fresh pulling that drop up
I came around the set nothing less where niggas cop up
So I had no choice but to grind and get this guap up
Ever since a boy just my moms and my poppa
I don't really fuck with rap I do it cause I got to
I do it for my fans and for my mans for the dollars
On the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas
To get this change another chain nigga
On the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas
On the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas
Just bring your all and get these ones niggas
Never rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga
I know I bring you pain same time bring you joy
Through all the shit we've been through you know I'm still your boy
You know I'mma ride we still got each other
Taking care of lil' brother you my one and only mother
Look we ain't doing bad in fact we doing good
I'mma make it with this rap we gon' make it out the hood
Put his hands on you I wish a nigga would
Coming through strapped up black mac black hood
Was locked down for a minute I wasn't gone long
You wrote me back to back letters told me stay strong
I had rainy days you was with me through the storm
Nineteen years strong I ain't go without the grub
You and my pop had up and downs
Even though y'all separated everyday you used to come around
That's why I love you mom, and I love you dad
Your little soldier gon' go far with this pen and pad
If being broke ain't a joke ain't nobody smirking
I know I pushed my little dime down time to time
But I'm stuck in the hood fuck it I got to grind
Its gon' be real when I sign the line
But he don't see that razor and that work up on that scale
Winter time grind with the woolrich and the Taurus
Its [?] but you know you got to take them orders
You got to move them quarters that's how you get them o's
Now this one is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas
On the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas
And this one is for my young niggas
On the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas
Just bring your all and get these ones niggas
I remember days being dead broke
I got so motherfucking hungry man my head hurt
I had to get myself together make my head work
Man at the same time keep my rap career first
That's how we living in the struggle all we got is pride
So when a nigga take it from you shit you got to ride
Murder homicide
So by all means necessary I'mma strive
To get my momma out the hood since my father died
If you don't you don't shine shit I got to try
A made man a brave man nigga I am I
You keep your faith in money I keep mine in God
On the road to the riches
Me and my niggas counting dough

Who said that money isn't everything?
Whoever told you that they a  damn liar
Cause all this money, it can buy you everything
I don't know nothing that money can't buy
I ain't never sinned, I ain't ever crossed over
Everywhere I go I'm pulling up burners
Defend this code, the feds all delivering
Yeah, I fuck with Papi, but no, I ain't Dominican
For the love of dividends, it's been around the block
I let them know I got it cause he out there round the clock
In the projects jewelry mean you made it
And the body might get you famous
And the key might get you stopped
It's no apology, nigga, it's criminology, nigga
And I done see these bitches do it all for the paper
And I done see this paper turn my dog to a hater

Who said that money isn't everything?
Whoever told you that they a  damn liar
Cause all this money, it can buy you everything
I don't know nothing that money can't buy
And I ain't never jealous, and I don't get emotional
Talking over details, tying up the loose ends
Know me from the project, They used to go "yo who that"?
Copped all my mixtapes, you tryna roll up
You heard I was moving shit, wait a second, hold up
They tryna get inside, the phones, they got ears
They also got eyes, you know
We break it down and we get them blocks
Cause if you play around getting guap
We gonna lay you down, get a mop
No, everywhere, every day, ever route
Every smoke that we light and it's on
Let's go
And I done see these bitches do it all for the paper
And I done see this paper turn my dog to a hater
For the love of the money, the love of the dough
For the love of the money, them hoes fucking for sure
Whoever told you that they a  damn liar

It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it it's inevitable
Live by the chopper laws die by the streets
Fuck a job getting paid dollars by the week
And the [?] take the long fall
That's why I grind trying to shine like a lone star
My mom right in the mix, pistol in my palm tight
You worried by a limelight I'd rather get my grind right
I rhyme nice, niggas trying to stunt like it's prom night
But I'm in my prime like Lebron in the highlight
That's why theses niggas can't stop me, copy nor clone
That's why these hoes on my, they the boy hungry
They heard I keep it real them other boys phony
But I'mma give these niggas hell 'til the lord call me
I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's come right back
I know its' going to destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
The flow sick but I find ways to make it better
That block hot but I find ways to make that cheddar
I might drop my album might flop
But I got a lot of guap so my watch gon' shine forever
I got blocks of chicken, I love my position
I'm in my own division, I make my own decisions
You tryna to stop what I'm building then I'm going to prison
I swear on everything, dawg I'll let it ring
Rock your fucking bells like LL [?] fucking rip my change
Now listen I play careful in these streets
You want to hear the real then stick your ear up to this beat
I flow hard go hard cause I got to homie
I got it soft I got is hard who tryna cop it homie
This game I play is realer than a [?]
I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's come right back
I know its' going to destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it it's inevitable
Wrong time wrong place caught the wrong case
They had me sitting in the F getting the O face
Thinking hard
We ain't shooting just to get a name cause we murder
No witness they ain't see what happen but they heard 'em
We serve 'em, do they boys proper with them big choppers
Tell the law to call the coroners, forget the doctors
Cause that nigga dead, hit his body hit his dead
Ya, shit I can make you soldiers disappear
And take you pussy niggas out like fast food
Bad moves, I'll have him drop the shells like they cashews
Cash rules everything that's near me
A lot niggas they be scary
But I be in the hood super dirty like I'm Harry
Catch me I be fresher than I've been
Hater, no I've never been
You catch me in the squad I'm riding by you with that metal and
I be on the south side but north death forever him
From where they get that work and run that cheddar in
You better than, who not me
Mel Love and Young P
Be for real that Nigga 'Lil he a fucking young G
And I'm a boss you can tell Ricky Ross to come see
In Philly, where the murder rate get higher than a tree
That sour that D purp, piff ooh wee
Have a nigga on lean like promethazine
I'm a pro with the wings like pay less pay that
Throw it in the hood, the fiends say it's good
And the dope boys they go crazy and come straight back
Like cornrows, you niggas on hoes
Fuck a brick, I'm trying to get it by the boat load
Getting money I wouldn't really say that
Drop pot and weigh that
Chop rock and slang that
Middle of the hood the narcs lurking where you stay at
My man told me never do dirt where you lay at
The fiends fiending got the work so fuck it I'mma take that
I ain't going to let it walk by me, I'mma chase that
There's money to be made got to make that, real

Halfway in and halfway out

You got a bitch with you, you still acting sober
But you high as fuck cause you just smoked a L
And if this nigga play wrong we ain't goin' to jail
Motherfucker, ya'll niggas rats, show and tell

Slow motion, sippin' on purp potion

A millionaire they say I'm chosen
Red beam on 'em, they moving you know I spot 'em
Hit 'em in the dark nigga fucking with the larks
Playin' round you get parked, 106 when I spark
On this drum clip, young nigga but I run shit
And you stupid as a dumb bitch
I make a dumb bitch give me head, let you know where I'm from bitch
The 8, posted by the gate
Ion fuck with none of ya'll rappers, I can't relate
All that shit you talking that nigga, it ain't
I used to play that fuckin' corner, paranoid getting high off the marijuana
Tryna swing that work nigga, this is our life
Strapped down, .44 nigga (pop pop)
Crack life but we on tour nigga, mac life let that thing roar nigga
I seen niggas go to early graves
For tryna play with hammers in they early days
I fall back I got nah, got pearly waves
My shit flowin', and I'mma keep on goin'
And I'mma get this money, everybody they be knowin'
That I came from the bottom and I made it to the top
And I started with a '22, I made it to a Glock
Then I stepped up to the mac, then I went and copped a bat
'Member started with the 'lac, back then remember that?
We was getting chased by the rock
He caught his own ? down on snub block
He got booked with an ounce of crack, shit was rock
They tried to take that nigga in, we hold up shit to stop, put it in the car
They couldn't even find the O nigga, it was hard
He put that thing behind the badge, shit it was soft
He couldn't find it, had to rewind us
We all got booked with the lil' pair of Irons
Let me bring it back and remind it
The same block I got pulled on when they found us
Put me in the cell, we was comin' a scooby
We had a lil sprinter, we ain't come in a hoopty
He come down I told my niggas, "mm mm"
I put a hole in ya head, I ain't talking no coofy nigga
I Rich Blade,  talking no Coogi nigga
I slip you one, ain't talking no Roofy nigga
You playin' round nigga we gon' gun ya down
Walk up on you, if you running we gon' run ya down
My young niggas gettin' money, we don't fuck around
All ya;ll niggas on your team, ya'll fuckin' clowns
It's all real niggas, we don't rob we kill niggas
We treat 'em like, ya'll niggas pump fake and fire drill niggas
Young niggas gettin' money
And we don't owe you niggas shit
I'm from Philly nigga
We come from the bottom
And niggas got the nerve to ask me why I'm stuntin'?
Huh?
I'da sip Ciroc with Diddy, drunk Spade with Hov
In the VIP of the 40, with some bad-ass hoes
The same night work got cooked half that sold
A pyrex and a triple beam
Like Mr. King had a dream we ain't miss a fiend
If I was there you know we ball, Mr. Clean
Just getting right cause in my life I been from hell and back
I'm just that nice and I don't write so you can tell 'em that
I'm just making up for nights when I was selling crack
On the corner in the cold tryna sling them O's
And half my niggas in the city went against the code
Them niggas told, still partying them niggas bold
But I'm like fuck it I'm young and getting it them niggas old
Take a walk up to that mirror boy look at yourself
You see a getta or a nigga just lookin' for help
And every night I'm in the studio killing myself
Fuck em' though
They screaming be humble, boy be humble
But ain't nobody say that when my stomach used to rumble
Looked in a cell when I seen my dreams crumble
Now I'm out here buzzing you can here the bee's bumble
I just went at every thing I dove
Nobody's going back to da bottom
Nobody's going to da bottom
I can't be every nigga role model
I can't go back to the bottom
When I'm just getting by couple million for a rainy day
Off season but I practice like I got a game today
Feeling like Mike before the fade away
I'm like should I take the shot? or let it fade away?
And all this love I'm getting ain't gon' take the hate away
But these haters motivate me in a crazy way
Ain't no I in team - from what I done seen
It's every man for himself well, until I intervene
When dream shatters they sell love like cocaine
Or heroin from heroin I'm Cobain
I'm blowing up I did my own thing
Nigga
I was told these roads was pure as gold
I never told I never sold my soul
I just went at everything I dove
Nobody's going back to da bottom
Nobody's going to da bottom
I can't go back to the bottom
The devil 'round the corner and the reaper a block away
It's body after body very few of us find a way
You gotta watch for the hook like you sticking Dr. J
I get soft every time we go against ya'll
You get crossed like AI did Mike for this ball
For this rock, you get shot, picked off
Cause in this game we shooting metal like it's pin ball
I put this Mac to your face like lip gloss
And do you right and put you on ice like Lindros
Nigga
Nobody's going back to da bottom
Nobody's going to da bottom
I can't be every nigga role model
I can't go back to the bottom
I started with a dollar and a dream
And I'm willing to go and get it by any means
I can't be every nigga role model
Why nobody my role model
I got my own son to raise
And my life is very precious
And my son expect me to walk through that door every night
So any nigga try and stop my shine gotta get it
None of my niggas
I hear everybody talking
He spending too much money be humble
Man fuck all that
It's D.C. double M, G
We been jumped out the barrel on your crab ass niggas

Use two hands when I’m clapping it still
Got a pack full of crack and a pack full of pills
Because we hustle for the muscle
Yeah [?] came back and he back for the thrill
I’m in my brown paper bag, and I think I’m taking over
See my fridge and freezer empty, but this ice and baking soda
So we take it to the plot, chop it up and make them boulders
Shouts out to the fiends that paid us

Before I drop a dime, tell them people a lie
Swear to God, man, I was nineteen I caught my first case
Nine co-defendants and snitchin' wasn’t the worst case
Had a hard time givin' my name and my birth date
But nowadays niggas go to jail and it’s a earthquake
Rattin' their connect out, tellin' where they got the hook up
Back to the home, niggas fuckin' with him, good luck
Twelve shots of Henny to the face got me stood up
Any situation, ask about me and I stood up
Catch you slippin' like a transmission, fuck your hood up
From my hood to who your hood, good, what up?

Check my record for the fame, ain't really hard to prove it
Went to jail, came home to that kitchen just like Martha Stewart
With a Pyrex tryin' to make a nine stretch
Just was in the yard with lifers, workin' on my biceps
When I was missin' sleep and workin' weeks to get my mom set
'Cause I remember some nights I used to hold that gun tight
Middle of the jungle tryin' to make it to the sunlight
Stillmatic with that pen and pad, just give me One Mic
And I'm gon' get richer, they gon' get sicker
Why they mad at me? 'Cause they ain't in the picture
'Cause they was on some bullshit when they started flickin'
And the camera started flashin', niggas came up missin'
Black Chevelle on them blades, boy
Dark shades, leather jacket like I'm Blade, boy
Come through my city like, "What’s the focus, boy?"
I come though with open doors
Middle finger every cop
Chevy block engines, everything is heavy stop
Sweat pants, the car dance, I make that bitch do the wop
Man, I'm losin' my religion
Got these angels on my shoulders and they tellin' me to listen
I blast this Alpine and get lost in my system
They tellin' me it's devil music and demons have imprisoned
This strap got no Velcro
So I’m down for whatever, whenever, wherever
Every night I’m on the road, tryin' to get how it come
Still findin' time just to kick it with my son
I know niggas see them blogs and it's lookin' like it's fun
Yeah, you gotta pick every crumb
I never thought I'd see the day that I get up out the slums
Did it for my team, put 'em on some ones
And every day we shittin' on them, we them niggas with some runs
I was outta control, block was hot as a stove
I was out with them O's, same time the block was patrolled
Hold up wait a minute
Y'all thought I was finished

Trapping out the bando money knocking like who is it
Think that Benji at the door, grab the chopper go and get it

Let that mac off screaming, we cook that crack hard, cement
I got your rent on my belt, talking your house on my wrist
That's murder sing bloody murder bloody murder
I ask your bitch do all this money made her nervous
When bosses talking shut your mouth if you a worker
Cause I've been working chasing money like I'm hurting
Roll the partition up
All in the cut act like this broad give a fuck
I know she down for whatever gon' do it all for a buck
And now that Boosie back home know we gon' ball for a month
And suckas all in the back, and all of us strapped
Why don't we fuck with you pussy niggas, cause all of them rats

Ice man conscious and my money is growing trees
Sicker than ever richer than ever call a Brinks truck
What the fuck you mean girl, its two words bitch fuck

What the fuck you mean, what the fuck you mean
Fuck you, fuck your momma, and fuck your team

Ugh, lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't in to making friends
Say loyalty make a man, got a homie and he told
Knew him since a child, man this game so wild
But niggas made vows to a code I never break
Ridin' in the heavy weight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it feather weight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
And I'm trying to get full, masks on clips full
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like its a brick store
On my dick nigga, thats what I thought your chick for
You pissed off, I only deal with the big dogs
Could've bought a Maybach before I signed with Rick Ross
That's the reason that I'm turnin' up
Doin' donuts while these haters got these niggas burnin' up
Niggas want to murder us, this label want me purpula
Cause I can't understand that, money rubber band that
Take off in my city, and your city where I land at
When I'm in your town forty rounds in my damn strap
Sipping on ciroc on’er then a light switch
In my 96 impala growlin thru the night shift
Catch you while tha cameras off, show up to ya damn house
Like excuse me MA’AM where such & such ride hard no buckle up
All left hooks right uppercuts treat you like the beat then fuck you up
In tha kitchen wit a 6 duce tryna turn there to a maybach

Out shy niggas like ten to one, ???? but there ten of them
Bitch done fucked like ten of dem, oops I mean like ten of us

Illuminati want my mind, soul, and body
They ask me would I trade it all for a maseratti

Plus a phantom, panamera and the bugatti
We can work a deal, I put my mom up on the hill

Let them niggas have the Grammys, we got the streets
We rich already and my chick the baddest
This Rollie like my trophy, young nigga
When they needed motivation (What you do?)

When my nigga needed money (What you do?)
I gave him dope
Every time we went to war (What we do?)
We gave 'em smoke
Fiends was copping, I was broke
Fuck that shit, we gave 'em soap
They forgot we gave 'em hope
I would spend time on that corner trying to stack me a hundred up
Strapped with that Glock with on my hip shit the coppers was running up
They had it segregated, bulletproof Caddy, I escalated
Stepped up in my game like a escalator
Seen 'em ride with the fake and I hesitated
Judge had to sentence a nigga, no period
I'm putting fear in these niggas, ain't sparing these niggas
I cut out your head with a hair on the trigger
Try to reach for my chain shit I deal with you niggas
Uh, back in the Phil, we gon' get to the money and stack up that dough 'til it way up
'Member them bitches? They played us back in the day like a Sega
Now I got paper, young nigga doing so major

When my nigga needed money (What you do?)

Every time we went to war (What we do?)
Fiends was copping, I was broke

Shit that you're popping ain't adding up
Shit that you're popping ain't making sense
And it's fifty reasons I should kill, nigga
But, for real, nigga, I been taking trips with my Philly niggas
Got the richest chick, she's from your hood
Niggas hating on me, I ain't really tripping, shit, I'm good

Try and keep that nigga out the field cuz he be throwin’ white
Dishin’ d, tryna get rich as me

Bitches say they missin’ me, I never fall for it
Cuz they just miss the money, they know I go hard for it
And if my niggas need it, I tell ‘em come for it
Cuz when it comes to me, they shootin’ like a small forward, swish
My life is realer than I can explain
Shootin' out with killers and choppin' em things
Tryna make a killin from rockin the cake
They locked me in chains, niggas took shots with my frame
In Killadelphia were bodies be dropping like rain
Where bodies be dropping like rain
I say that meek shall inherit the earth
So I’ma own this bitch until I’m buried in dirt
I only roll with nigga that'll carry me to my hearse
Blesses for my grandma, she carried me to that church
And I don’t know why, I just feel like I’m the one
They label me a victim but now look what I become
Or should I say became, I don’t do it for the fame
I’m from where they never make it but I went against the grain
Charges riding against my name, assasination to my character
Life’s a bitch, she cheated on me but I married her
Dodging all the pot holes, jumping all the barriers
And if she a bitch, I feel like I just got in that pussy
Shorty wanna be a star, that’s why she popping that pussy
She trying to win so she hang amongst winners
That’s why I take the time just to pray at mom’s dinner
Cause I remember, cold nights not the winter
Not the weather, I’m talk about within us
Cause for that money, sins they get committed
And friends they get to splittin', divided just like division
So eryday that I wake up, my undivided attention
It goes to getting that cake up and staying out of the prisons
The system made me stronger
And being broke just gave me my hunger
Even if you put your [?] hustle non-stop
We be getting to that dollar get get getting to that dollar

Like gone like we too high for your niggas
I stayed like MJ we the best
I worked that's just how I got here
I'm a young boss I worked for this spot here
But enough of that stuff, girl let's crank this bitch up
I got it, baby we could fly away to the tropics
You want it so quit stalling
Cause if I get the goodies you gon' sing to me
Gimme more (gimme more), gimme more (gimme that) (x4)
And once I body like Tyson its gon' be a [?]
Baby I'm the boss, them boys they work for me
And me I work for you, you get the work to me
If it works for you, you know it works for me
Just name it and I'mma cop
Baby now what's the topic
Hold up I'm not done yet
My whole clique here got all of these chicks wet
Cause the ride switch gears speed up like a get
She all up in my [?] my girl 'bout to be my ex
I'm like baby gimme more of that
She like give me some of that, shawty gimme all of that
Ball that, hubby call her phone and she like call back
Sit her in my spaceship and take her where the stars at
I show her stuff that she ain't ever seen
Cause I'm forever clean, give her my medicine
He said he balling I could put you on another team
Make you my star player (and we taking off later)
I ain't no killa but don't push me
I look a nigga in his eyes, tell ya if he pussy
Remembering the times the people would overlook me
Wanted to be a star, they lock me behind bars
I know I'mma shine hard
I had no choice but to win
But the odds was against me
So I'm rolling through this bitch with my palms on my Semi
My Dad died when I was young so my Mom would defend me
And my sister would protect me
Now the made niggas respect me
Learn to work that scale, turn the mouses into grams
Now I'm the best thing since zaf curry on the lamb
Ocean Drive in the drop head like I'm dreaming
Skinny nigga, big dreams, lot of pride
My heart cold as Omelly heart when his Mama died
Or cold like Tashima & Ta' when my Aunt Rhonda died
Niggas got fat when we starve, It wasn't Ramadan
But sunny days, we ain't need a lot of time
So I'm like Tony Hawk on a skating board, I gotta grind
What I wouldn't do for a dollar sign, I don't know
It ain't bout money nigga I don't go
Shoot him in his head now he's John Doe
Nine on me, Rondo
I turned a condo into a fuckin'
Once he got sentenced
At 10 I lost my pops, too many years he been missing
Mum B, mind gone at all time, that shit ridiculous
Bright lights and flights
See what this life will bring to you?
See what that shit'll bring to you?
The world is ice cold
Poncho, show him what that flame do
9 millimeters for evil, he can aim too
I seen it all befo'
Seen my mama praying
Seen my B forget my name
Seen my brother's walls cave in
Lately it's a nightmare
Cause it's a war going on and these people don't fight fair
Asking what the feeling like to see my family living right
Proud of myself because my name light up these Philly nights
God, I hope I'm living right and sorry for the tattoos
But if I go tonight, please take care of my nephews
I make the song cry
Make it drip, make it tear
Told you niggas from the rip
From the tier every beat
That I get I'mma rip, I'mma tear in pieces
Like deuces I be super sport creeping
I say, I be with the cool kids
SRT-8 her like scrapers on some coon shit
I said we move shit
Eat a dick I do's this
They be on that goon shit
We on that Looney Tune shit
But I let that tool spit, air something
Bet I let that tool rip, tear something
Far way back, we head huntin'
We be on that shit for real a head buster
Blowing on some fruity fruit
Chain look like Juicy Fruit, mixed up Fruity Loops
Ayo where my boys at, squad up, hootie-hoo
Bitch you either out or in the circle like a hula hoop
And I spit that fire and you tire like an inner tube
All these niggas liars
Call me pliers how I'm grippin' dudes
You should see how I be dipping through
I said tell him they don't want this
Cookie, pussy boy, bubblegum shit
Bitch made, uh

Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day

Still goin' bad on you anyway
Woah, woah, ooh, woah
Woah, woah, ah
I could fit like 80 racks in my Amiris (80 racks)
If you fuckin' with my opps, just don't come near me (Get outta my way)
Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry (Brrt, brrt, ooh)
Richard Mille cost a Lambo (That's a Lambo)
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo (Extended)
For real
She said, "Oh, you rich rich?" ("You rich rich")

When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Saw you last night, but did it broad day
Wheezy outta here

These hoes be acting up, these hoes be acting up

And these niggas be sweating 'em

This bitch done bought me a Rolex
And I still ain't got no time for her
These hoes be acting up
These niggas be acting tough
I'm in the Phantom, I'm backing up
And I'm bust down but I'm strapped as fuck
So hold your horses, Polo horses
Aston Martin, we roll in Royces
These hoes be acting up, and these niggas be letting 'em
These hoes be acting up, and these niggas be letting 'em
These niggas be letting 'em, these niggas be letting 'em
These niggas be letting 'em, and me, I don't be sweating 'em
These hoes be acting up, these hoes be acting up
These hoes be acting up
See, me, I don't practice much
Gold albums from the word of mouth
Gold bottles in the back of us
These Jones be broke as fuck
She got her arms folded even on the phone
I'm like what the fuck is she here for?
These hoes be acting up
These niggas keep wifing them
Please homie, got me cracking up
Never spent one more than a night with her
Cause you can hit my phone like four in the morning
And I be like, hah, I told you so, word
These hoes be acting up, these hoes be acting up
These hoes be acting up, these hoes be acting up
These hoes be acting up, and these niggas be letting 'em

Ratchet ass ho, don't play with me
Want to Kobe me, want to Humphrey me
Want to Michael me, Russell me
Take me to the bank and Tiger me

These drums 100 rounds and up
Bitch, blow me, like a, trumpet
Money, money, money (ah!) hah

Lyrics From Snippet
Say me and my dogs [?], feeling like the one (Ooh Yeah)
Tre pound, crack crown
Meek Milly, Bloodhound
Grimy, thirsty, 'bout it you heard me
Glizzy on de-deck
Clip whole thirty
My goons, they balloon shit air you
Nah nigga I ain't trying to hear you
And I don't need no four pound cause I ain't trying to scare you
I just take the nina raw, get up on you near you
Action 40 lightning bloody near you, tear you
Tinted with them choppers though
We spin yo block my Mr. Softee, spot you like a domino
Simon say he want you dead, I say that you got to go
So we gone drop some shit on you Geronimo, asap
Make that nigga Diddy bop take that, take that
Send him on a trip without a space pack, bow
My hood like goons gone wild
Where Ernie said he don't want no beef he want a cow
A fool with them tools we don't even let him touch them
Get freaky with them heaters he be trying to finger fuck them
Niggas creeping in my main yard, peeking through the window
Bird hunting like the gun game on Nintendo
Wish that I was there I probably would've let them in though
And stretch one of them nigga like a limo
Trying score a touchdown, nigga fuck around and catch an INO
Cause I ain't never go to sleep n-o, nizzaw
Can't get behind me cause my back to the wizal
Gat in my drizzaws, ready to clap izzoff
They gon' murder me so I got to murder them first
And I gon' kill his brother cousin, him first
Give them niggas brim work, chest work
They say that that's the best work
So I'm gon' gun them down like an expert, tise
Aiming at chu and my mac gon' sneeze
My refrigerator put you on freeze
Fuck out of here
We do them niggas right and get up out of there
I'm loading up the oo-wop
Listening to 2Pac
A hundred grand large, all off of hard
I don't fuck with rappers all y'all frauds
Calling all cars, AR-AB got a gun
Crack in the bag cause AR-AB got a son
And he got to eat, by any means
I got two fiends, fuck a hoop dream
Make it to the NBA that's a pipe dream
They end up smoking rock out of pipe screen
Forty-four with the long nose Scott Pippen
I put it on the line, I put it on my mom
I've been shooting niggas since they put it in my palm
Put it in my hands, them cooked up grams
Where I'm from all the drug dealers was the man
I'm a legend in jail, and trap streets
They talking to a deaf man, forty in my left hand
Give a nigga wig shots then look for the next man
I shoot 'til the tec jam, then pass [?]
A lord take my soul if AR-AB [?]
Trying to rob AR-AB niggas asking to die
Years in the cell, I called my little brother
He hit both witness, then I got acquitted
I talking your kids, I make them show ribs
My gun so big it take his whole head
Aye so if you talking about me then you talking bout money
Don't even throw my name if you ain't talking about hunnids
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)
If you ain't really know me know I'm a hundred mile running
Looking for the top stop ya its the way a nigga gunning
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)
Look I do me hommie do you
If real recognize real nigga who you
Looking all black everything on them 22's
Cause I be getting to the money and my swagger through the roof
Got that hater looking funny doesn't matter what they do
But if they say they getting money tell them niggas show the proof
Now if you talking about this then we talking about that
We ain't talking about shit if we ain't talking about stacks
We ain't talking about bitches nigga pardon my [?]
Put my dick all in her mouth you hear about it you a loser
Ha ha I said youngin' bout his paper
Getting to the money like mahfuck a hater
My Glock on ya my block on
I pull up in the six you know the top gone
Look like a spotlight I put my watch on
We making movies bitch got get your popcorn
Bet you heard I get money I'm a certified G
I'm a north side nigga but you know that I be
On the south side with my niggas getting to the money
I woke up early in the morning where the bread at
Hollywood to MIA you know I did that
And when it come to Philly nigga know I is that
I'm getting money I'm paid
Huh I'm getting money I'm paid
Look at them niggas hating throwing shade
I do me, do you
I do me, do you
I do me, do you
And the only person man, can make you fall that particular place, is yourself
You can't rely on outside man shit to effect you
Shit that you don't have no control, it should never effect you
Feel like I lost my soul, selling Os fucking hoes in the dope game
And we did it all double cross, triple cross for the love of the cocaine
The triple beams, put me in these Balmain jeans
Yeah, this that treacherous nights, Killadelphia type shit
Hold your Thirty tight, when you go to sleep
All we know is gun violence (Gun violence)
Go to jail, come back and now your son wildin' (He wildin')
Sittin' on the couch with his grandmamas, smelling like gun powder (Fuck that shit)
Yee, Yee, all we know is gun violence (That's all we know)
He just smoked a nigga broad day, ain't give a fuck 'bout it (Hrr)
Now it's murder gone to his head, he gettin' a rush 'bout it (He get a rush)
They ain’t fucking with me, New Orleans N.O
Old school bitch I let her blow me like nintendo
Black panamera, me and Mac are getting lit though
Switching lanes in that thang 5 percent tint on the windows
I got 20 in my pocket, 30 on wrist, 50 on my neck keep it 100 in this bitch
And I was never in the walking, I’m just running up in your pick
I say my swagger on infinity, money it ain't a limit
Real nigga every day, start and to the finish
You should hear this roar when I’m starting up the engine
Sounding like a motherfucker lion barking all up in it
Make a dollar every second, thousands on the hour
Pause
I’m getting to it, you niggas loosing shit, I’m a boss
Me and Gucci Poochy, shooting at the tables
When I was broke, I used to have a dream
Before I had a dream best believe I had them fiends
Steady blowing up my celly, trying to get it any means
My nigga swoochy in the kitchen working up the triple-beams
Breaking ounces off the birdie, money it was dirty
And that’s word to Osama though
Leaning off the prometh, sipping Aunt Jemima though
Rollie all bussed down, call that perfect timing though
Tell my jeweler freeze me, just to change the climate ho
Bottom of the mountain and Meek Milly got the climbing though
My swag fly shit, your swag, norbit
Nigga you’re a weirdo, no match forfeit
Coolest on your stereo, I don’t think they hear me though
Used to sell them little O's I ain’t talking cheerios
I’m talking about them golden grahams and I don’t eat no cereal
Killer plus I’m realer this is scarier than thriller
And my flow be on some other shit
Hotter than an oven get
I just got his girl's number, he gon' need another bitch
Maker her fuck my other bitch, then put her on a punishment
She said she in love with me and she dont know my government
Shorty tripping, where your luggage at
Broke niggas never seen me cause I'm where the money at
All I know is hustle hard, like a got a hundred pack
A nigga get my jewels, I'mma kill him, and I don't want them back
Wear them to your funeral, be stunting while they're viewing you
Momma wouldn't notice, she's like what the hell they do to you
Yeah nigga, I will ruin you
Stop playing with these niggas get on that grimy shit
Let them know its still Meek Milly nigga
Heard that
Old money new work
You can smell the crack aroma on my new shirt
One shooter two hearse
Did them dirty put them niggas on the news first
Niggas think because I'm rapping I won't slide up on them niggas with that ratchet
Most of you pussy ass niggas get to ratting
Consequences make them feel the drum
That's real talk get on that grimy shit
Shout out to [?]
I tell him pass it off and he gon' pass it off
And when it come to questions he won't ask at all
I get you everything [?]
Do you really want that
About that paper my nigga Oschi will be at your front step
That's how a hitta get it though
About that money my nigga CP be in your window
And Omelly be at your bitch spot
With a big Glock trying to get the big drop
Soon as you come get the pussy you gon' catch a headshot
Aww yes
Play around watch the waiter boy lay it down
You the best say it now I don't think so
Don't let the pride weigh you down you gon' sink slow
Checking my fresh you should be checking bank rolls
I'm really that nigga to fuck without a tempo
I'm in a sauna climbing a llama
My baby momma trying to figure out if I'm in some drama
I'm sleeping on top of the covers
Locks on the shutter
I'm going through she wondering why won't I fuck her
I'm getting [?]
Black hoodies and skullys wiggles in the cellophane
Roll up puff and pass it
Tuck the ratchet
Five be in your area
Second floor back room trying to check your brother out
Blow [?]
Chilling in your drive way peeling out pronto
Skrrrr first we grip CL
Straight to the condo everything DL
When I get my tag on I put that mask on
Still ride or die [?] drag on
Used to run it in plenty grams it would add on
Drake shit best had 40 in my jet lag
You just know you're rolling play your part just like a step dad
Don't worry if that tec jam up
Them niggas come in packs then we hit them all up
See my youngin had a dream with a bird in it
SK shoot had the curb chipping
Diesel and the syrup sipping
Out of town make a presence when I'm not around
There's no cause they clip up and ride around
My nigga Doc be at your mom crib
My nigga Wiz be at your mom crib
That nigga Snoop be at your mom crib
Neighbors looking like what the fuck did your mom did
With that Parabellum nine hollows let them all go
Run this shit like Marlow
Spark that man like Waldo
Ay Rug
I go hard in the paint
We ain't even got to talk about that
Shorty standing there ass fatter than Rasputia is
I play for the dream team, hang out with the coolest kids
Watch out for my Louie belt cause that's right where my Ruger is
Leave you stankin' nigga, what the fuck you thinkin' nigga?
Five presidents on that presidential Lincoln nigga
Gold presidential out the window middle finger nigga
Fuck 'em all that's how I feel
Shitting on these niggas without a deal
My money right I'm super strapped
Talking all that hammer shit where your toolie at
Ask around the town we be doing that
All that white and sour diesel we be moving that
That's word to my thirty-six O's
In thirty days I'm trying to fuck thirty rich hoes
I'll still be spitting that flamerz like thirty-six stoves, woah
North side 'til the death of me, definitely
Camero with the black stripe, referee preferably
I be feeling myself and I ain't on no Ecstasy
But the groupies is and you can tell by how they molested me
She gon' suck my dick, she gon' suck it too
She gon' fuck Omelly, and she gon' fuck the crew
Now she fuck with me, she don't fuck with you
And that's crazy dawg you know that was your fucking boo
That's the reason why you hating
Let the streets say what they want because I'm caking
Shout out to all of the niggas that thought that I wouldn't make it
They the fakest ones hating while I was in the basement
Where I'm from getting money be the object
I get mine putting fire to the Pyrex
Fuck a diss track I bring it to you direct
I kill you then the witness die next
44 Bulldog is a 5x
You never progress if you only side bet
I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone
I just grabbed two birds but one gone
I supply it well that's my clientele
I fire shells if any one of my clients tell
Until then I'm only trying to gain revenue
Razor blade in a plate full of residue
Being broke like you is what I'll never do
Purple juice and them Xans got me sleep walking
She say niggas like me she don't see often
And I don't care if he shot I just keep sparking
I make niggas throw towels and make peace offerings
I just give them bank rolls and tell them keep walking
I just show a bitch money I don't keep talking
Then she slob on my knob like she retarded
Sour D 4 grams stuffed in the Dutch
Fifty grand rubber band tucked in the cut
Two bitches four hands touching my nuts
Then I give them long dick touching their gut
If money is the topic I get it like Floyd
I be OG, moving grams of the [?]
If I don't know niggas my hand on toy
Cause I'm a fucking shooter, Brandon Roy
I only blow good smoke the L's 550
You not a real connect if you can't supply fifty
My cousin Nas get half cause he'll die with me
O.B.H be the set and we gon' get ours'
I was in the crack house with eight vowels
You was like Eminem off of eight mile
In your shitty house writing rap songs
I use to run in niggas house with the mac on
I guess you only need one mic like Nas
I'll take a full pound in a white pie
Glock 30 compact that's the right size
I'm talking brick sales get your order up
I dry cook mine I don't like it watered up
Hating is a weak emotion
A sign of failure
Nigga stop your hating, get off your ass
Worrying about the next nigga, that’ll cost your ass
Go get on your grind nigga and off the pad
Slow grind until the top, but you’re falling fast
You can hate on me
Boyyy
Hate on me I volunteer
Locked up on the toppest tier
Trying to get up out of there
This the home where failure from
Future I’ll fly up out of here
Some of us gonna make it, homie
Some niggas gonna die in here
Yea, but ain’t no hate gonna get you out of here
Hating niggas never prosper, hating gotta stop you there
Niggas that made it to the top, start hating then got dropped from there
Yea, get the money nigga, why hate?
No time for hating, only money on my mind stay
Hating is the leading cause of killings and the crime rate
Yea, they my motivators though
Every chance I see I’m ‘a take because I know what they waiting for
They waiting on the day I fall, but hate won’t work at all
Nigga stop your hating, get off your ass
Worrying about the next nigga, that’ll cost your ass
Go get on your grind nigga and off the pad
You can hate on me
Hate is my motivator
Boyyy
Lebron ain’t make it to the NBA from hating
He made it from dedication, ambition and motivation
Addition to what they saying
Niggas voicing opinions
Them niggas can only judge me the judgment day of my ending
They judge me from the beginning
Hate it though, but it’s cool though
They giving gas to my engine, adding fire to fuel
I’m flyer than all these dudes
They see it that’s why they hate
I’m grinding because I’m shining, they grinding ‘cause they at state
I’m grinding because I’ve gotta, my bills they gotta get paid
Ain’t no hating gonna solve my problems so why would I even hate?
I’m gonna get it
That’s word to Robby, and my Aunt Terry
Some of my homies haters, that’s why I keep them near me
And when they hating on me, it feel like they cheering
Nigga stop your hating, get off your ass
Worrying about the next nigga, that’ll cost your ass
Go get on your grind nigga, and off the pad
Slow grind until the top, but you’re falling fast
Hate is my motivator
Boyyy
Hating is a weak emotion, sign of failure
Puffin on that purple, same color as Donatello
That hating gonna lead to your demise I’m trying to tell you, son
Ayo, this the one? We all get caught in our own sins. Sometimes I have to remind myself, that on my worst day, I live like somebody on their greatest—and so do you. Don't let your demons take you to Hell. Introduce 'em to Heaven!
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life
They said I wouldn't make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me ‘cause she said I did her wrong
‘Cause I left, to chase my dream, get it any means
I said that I'll be back, she wasn't listenin' to me
That back-and-forth arguin' was gettin' in between
I said fuck them other niggas, I go get it with my team
If we all grind, we all shine, fuck a part-time
I used to play the block early mornin' and dark time
Now it's G5 flights, fuck a depart time
It was hard times, nigga, now it's our time
‘Cause I was in them streets, my heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strappin' like we was in Iraq to fight
‘Cause niggas gettin' murdered for a block that do a stack a night
Whoa, I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In the hood, ain't no loyalty, ain't no world for your daughter
Ain't no life for your brother, on the life of my mother
I'ma get the fam right, nigga, you damn right!
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life
Right now I'm prayin' for my son to get this scholarship
Far as the hood go, I acknowledge it
But whoever ain't a snake's usually a follower
Luckily, I can tell the difference
My man comin' home, my other man gettin' sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hatin' on your pictures
Without workin' for it, not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins, others just find ditches
D-block, finish that and cop more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothin' all good when you all broke
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the Devil, he's see-through
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life
I had that little bad bitch with me the other night
She gon ask me why I don't ever go to sleep cause I was up
You know what I told that ho
I ain't going to sleep until I touch a hundred million
Bitches know its money when we step up in the building
Neck is saying cool but my wrist is saying chillin'
Stuntin' so hard I could hurt a hater feeling
Grind hard then you shine hard that's the motto
Y'all know, either going home or going hard doe
You only live once and I'm a ball until I fall ho
We just pull up on you haters looking like a car show
Made a hundred grand and I blew it
Made another hundred grand and I ran through it
Every time I get it spend it like its nothing to it
If I see it and I like I'm like Nike I just do it
I just cop it I just drop it [?]
Gucci Louis Polo [?]
Breitling Rollie Audemar
Fuck it I want all of it
Kobe though I'm balling bitch
Addicted to the money I guess I'm a cake-a-holic then
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich (what did you tell that ho?)
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich
All them bitches know its money when we step up in this bitch
They say ain't nothing coming to a sleeper but a dream
And I ain't been to sleep since I was fucking seveteen
Money that you've never seen
Graveyard shifting it
Late night getting it
All about the Benjamins
Break the work down let the Pyrex heat up
Hit my youngins off to count the money with my feet up
Let them sleep we up, hating nigga D up
I ain't going to sleep until I touch a hundred million
They talking about no homicide I say that I'm a kill them
Talking about that blow paper money to the ceiling
Chill then, ain't no time for cuddling and kissing
Just hustling and [?]
You tired just like Michelin
I be up like all night counting my percentages
Trapping all day and serving fiends like this was tennis here
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich like porter
Stared with a dollar turned that to four quarters
I hustle like I got three sons and four daughters
I'm porridge, flaming hot
You hating if you say I'm not
I buy that shit you say you got
I hustle I don't play a lot
Dawg I let my swagger do the talking I don't say a lot
Hustle and make it five times back I never save a lot
Word up
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich nigga
How do some of you niggas go to sleep dead broke
I don't understand them
Cause I ain't going to sleep until my bank account on muhfucking seven,eight digits nigga
You already know
Meek Milly Flamerz
I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always thought
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas said they with you when they really not (really not)
Niggas plot on everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Uh, I kept it triller from the very start
Seen so many people crossed me, don't know where to start
Yeah, still on them papers, they won't let me off
Never thought we'd make it out the ghetto, now look where we are
I done gave these niggas everything and that was from the heart
Rollie, chain, every car, all it did was left me scarred
Heard my dog talk behind my back and I'm like let him talk
I won't say his name but he gone feel this shit in every bar
Was it really worth it
Cut the grass and all the snakes gone surface
Nobody's perfect
Showed them cash, he kinda made me nervous
Maybe I'm trippin'
Hoping this paranoia from all this shit that we been in
Watched you pour gasoline, and burned out all of your bridges
Fuck it!
I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always thought
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas said they with you when they really not (really not)
Tears falling like the water when the levies drop
Boyz in the Hood, these niggas Tre' they screaming let me out
No they ain't riding, it was drama, I'm like yeah we out
Trying to please these niggas, shit gone prolly wear me out
Drive me crazy, I been by myself lately
40 on my belt lately, I ain't need no help lately
Nigga cross me, I cut him off and I felt crazy
'Cause I got a purple heart
Shit I'd rather work and walk 'fore I ride luxury with niggas that don't fuck with me
I'm startin' to hate this fame shit look what it done to me
Seen half these niggas turn they back when rappers tried to come for me
Don't want them in my company just want to be a company
Dream chasers, chasing dreams
Hate is fake, and love is real
Niggas said I wouldn't win told them yes the fuck I will
Hit the studio with all my feeling and I let 'em spill
Forever thorough, be a sucka nigga, no I never will (No!)
I gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always thought
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas plot on everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Uh, my heart heavy, my soul cleaner
When shorty got a big head, I was like hol' Gina
I had the whole squad lit, I had the city poppin'
I told my dog don't listen to them, get caught up in that gossip
They wanna see you in the hood back when you ain't got shit
Then everything went sour, this little thing of ours
Always kept it real from the very start (very start)
Niggas ain't thorough like I always thought
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas plot on everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Here we go again (x6)
In the Bent fitted to the back
Pull up to the club then we get into the back
Shawty show me love she let me get it from the back
And if I hit it from the back hommie you won't get her back
I say my swagger on metro
Limited with that though
My pockets like a gecko
Greener shit I [?]
Check a nigga like FEMA
If he try it he's a dreamer
I done fucked with Christina to Fatima to Karina
Rollie on my wrist Rollie on that bitch
She rolling on that shit we about to roll up out this bitch
Got that Rover out that bitch and we roll out to my [?]
I let her roll out to my crib then she rolling on my dick
Now she stuck in a dilemma Kelly Rowland out that bitch
Tell Omelly to roll over we start rolling on that bitch
Frutie roll up in that bitch
And we get higher than a fucking roller coaster out this bitch
My flow it ain't no stupid its retarded
You can't stand it why you start it
I'm hotter than wasabi copy
I be in Bally's prolly out in Cali
With Charlie out in the Mazi
I'm Louied down to the ground
My lay be browner than Bobby
The city respected highly
My chick be hotter than Halle
I see that you heard about me
I can see the madness
These niggas mad cause we get that cash
And stacking caddy wagon look like a Magnum
We add them making these haters sick to their stomach
Man them biddies be like who is he
Check up on my Louie V
Check up on my Louie shirt, Louie belt, Louie sneaks
Ask if I'm fresh yes
Hell raiser sitting in the Trail Blazer SS
Nigga super sport 'bout to chirp out
Niggas hitting shit and they got that work out
On your mark get set we getting ready
All these niggas loose bunch of spaghetti
I be popping my banger holding it steady
Letting the semi pop burn his chest like a Henny shot
Blasting, busting his top watching his [?]
Asking, I be like Arnold baby whats happening
Cracking, Rollie face studded its just a flashing
Fashion, D&G skully matching my jacket
Cracking, we got it popping baby what's happening
Fuck a shoe box I need a safe like baseball
Let my tool pop, knock off his face and take off
A maroon drop, niggas can't see me like Ray Charles
Niggas getting it popping they busting them tools off
Halfwayed out in a halfway house
But its like I'm halfway in but I'm halfway out
I swear that's its a blessing to be halfway out
But [?] I be right back in
Got to make my curfew I can't be halfway in
Cause if I'm halfway in then I'm halfway out
Yeah, we back in the hood
(Philly, wassup?)
I remember it was no lights
Mattress on the floor
Yeah, I remember it was no lights
Mattress on the floor
Yeah I remember all the cold nights (I do)
Niggas sold white just to live the Lo Life
Ralph Lauren, I was sinning
The crazy part is the designer ain't wanna send it
The dope dealer, was out in me
And not magic, you couldn't imagine
You either spit it raw, or sell crack and dribble the ball
It's crazy when I seen my own neighbor hitting the soft
I was thinking in my head like I gotta get with this raw
She's thinking like so what
My homie got colder
She even sold a nintendo, I'm thinking like hol' up
I done seen my homie mommy turn into a zombie
And it was like New Jersey Drive the way we throw them johnnies
Slide through like a bowling ball
Ain't had nowhere to go at all
I got the money and the power, made a nigga strong
I had respect before that
Cause I was always taught that
A nigga hit you hold that
Down baby, now it's thirty rounds baby
As I'm riding through my hood
It been going down crazy in this bitch
Where they murder for a half a pound baby
So imagine for a kilo
Shark in the water, Nemo
Skinny niggas with a full pound, turn to Deebo
Got the four five and the six call it cee-lo
Ya'll niggas talking 'bout murder, that ain't be though
Fuck what niggas tell us, I see 'em and know they jealous
Steppin' in my Margielas, this nina like my umbrella
Ballin' like I'm Melo
And kinging like I'm Coretta
Eighteen in my beretta and singing I won't do never
We shooting at all you pussies
Ringing on all you niggas
My city body for body
My finger all on the trigger
I'm ready my niggas heavy
Yellow gold all on my prezi
I'm feeling like I'm Andretti
I'm Freddie all in your dreams
My team full of gorillas
Killers on 4 wheelers
Fresh off of tour nigga
They wanna see my demise
Wanna see me with no job
Wanna see me back on the corner
With choppers like fuck the coppers
They wanna lock us in boxes
Courthouses and teleprompters
Jealous that I ain't jealous
They jealous that I ain't tellin'
I'm focused no I ain't failin'
Propellin' up in the sky
They jealous a nigga made it
I don't understand y'all suckas
Lemme tell 'em what I been through
Kenny Lee on the track
The way I'm flowin'
Keep it goin
I rip up the beat then I sew it, back together
Rap forever, its Philly
I'm in the porsche drop, 911 Porsche box
They can never eat me like a muslim and a pork chop
Of course not, I'm dunkin' until the court drops
Like B. Grif, I eat shit and hoarse blocks. HA!
Flame Spitta you a lame nigga
You can't compare a G4 to a Plane nigga
Thats like versing a peddle bike into a train nigga
Like Earl Boykins and letting Lebron James stick him HA!
It don't make no sense
How your label kick you out like you ain't paid no rent
Always been a star player, I ain't play no bench
Let these hoes be hoes
I dont say no bitch NAH!
Paws on the pork, but I be going HAM though
Riding on the beat like a mother fucking lambo
Hard Like X with, a '98 Cam flow
Sigel on the Roc, Nas on illmatic
I'm still at it
No matter my choice know Phil back it and cool with it
Flyer than most but goon with it and still hood
Honor roll swag real good
Diamond all on your neck but your album is stillwood
Money my medicine, It be making me feel good
They lock me inside a cell, ain't matter I still stood
As tall as Yao Ming, Gasol, Bynum, and Shaq
I'm rocking with rozay, Now they know that I'm back
I'm talking about that thang 360 stacks
360 Days with 5 more I grind on
On my [???] bag get my shine on
Bail money only thing I dropped a dime on
I tell them to get on the level that I'm on
Someone call the fireman just to cool me out
I'm hot smokin' really I'm not jokin'
Rapping automatic cause really they not smokin'
Put them in the booth kapoof Hokus Pokus
I make magic, Like the Lake Magic
But them in the water I drown em lake placid
And I got bars like I took the jail with me
When they let me out of prison I just took a cell with me
I ain't got to drop an album, do a tape to sell 50
I be blazin' in the booth tell your artist trail with me
They got a nigga on trial, they said I murdered the beat
They feel my pin and my pad my finger prints on the sheet
IMPORTANT: Rap Genius already has a version of this song:
URL:http://rapgenius.com/Dj-ill-will-cypher-lyrics
I said it's Kid Ink baby, turnt to the Maxx like T.J.,
Body tagged up like the bottom of the freeway
Game on lock you niggas need to get a key made
'Bout to roll up kush sticky like Elmer’s
Going head up with me? Bring a motherfuckin' helmet!
You niggas just Special Ed.,
All I see is green but my eyes so red
And all I do is win got a room full of clouds
'Bout to take another shot, but I’m used to the fouls
I'm ballin', you could take two to the mouth
Tell them deuces, just put two in the air
So sick, said it must be the flu in the air
If you do it big then I prolly did it obese
Up all night, gettin' higher then a nosebleed
Swear I was raised by beasts like Mowgli
Came from the bottom, rats and the roaches
Now niggas blunts ain't as fat as my roaches
I’ma shark in the water see the fin and it's over...
Time for me to wake 'em up
Countin' all these fucking Bennies
'Till I get a paper cut
Kill the competition
I bomb 'em then I make 'em up
When the 'caution' tape is up,
Ha! That record dead, memory of
Spittin' that crack, this really is drugs
You like a irritatin' fly; I’m killing your buzz
I’m eating the beat, this is Pacman
I’m on the grind like a mu'fuckin' lap dance
Erry nigga 'round me: robbin' -- Batman
All black coupes, all black wheels
Run, move or get yo mufuckin' cap peeled
Rollin' in this murder engine
Purrin' through yo neighborhood
Let my money do the talkin'
I ain't gotta say I'm good
Goonies that'll gun ya down
Ridin' like an engine bitch
I ain’t gotta say I’m hood...
I tell a ho to follow me or swallow me
I be spending money like I fuckin' hit the lottery
If I ever hit your girl then this is my apology
Cause suckas they be trippin'
I’m about to go: over 'round my arm
Leader winnin' I could feel it now
Taliban knock ya building down
High cock blocker, I’m a fly top shotta
In my all red Range like a high top Prada
And life would be drippin'
From my lips as I'm spitting that shit
Hungry as a poverty stricken, robbery victim
With a Roscoe's 'waffles and chicken'
With the doctor that killed Mike
Shine on the field now watch me kill all the field mice
I'm anthrax you Tampax, I'm 'bout to go Amtrax
Stand back I’m slammin' a antagonist
Slapping you faggots puttin' a can in the bandwagon it's:
Swag of the century, mack in a bitch or three
I heard the head was nothin' tryna crack it eventually
Rappers they mention me, boy I put this on my mother
You’ll end up Interscope, I'm just tryna Warner Brother
Still gettin' cheesecake on these dummies
Deal or No Deal, I got a briefcase full of money
Jahlil on the beat, Will hostin' this shit
Ya bitch in the rental she positions my dick in her dental
Ya know my bitch is a yellow-bone, on Yellowstone
Double scoop, chocolate women on my vanilla cone
Yellin' cause I'm very gone, yes I'm on a cherry bone
Things seem quicker than a ping hit your Berry phone
Y'all don't wanna talk about ballin' bar-e-ly Larry Holmes
Veteran, batter up, bat her in, it's a
End to you rappers like the letter after M and I'm a
Lamborghini nigga, nigga you could never see me I'm the
Shhh, triple 'H'; you gon' have to pedigree me bitch I'm
Ready for the beef like it's some lettuce in between me
You got eenie meenie money, teeny like the youngest primie
And even if you niggas is trippin' still could never see me
Or beat me with three wishes and a mu'fuckin' genie
Scared? It ain't fair when I play a record on ya
Weird and you square; I could play checkers on ya
Rap-pers, y'all ac-tors
And I rip this track 'til it's tra-ck
I, rollerblade; let it ride
Show my face; televised
Dot to ya top like the lowercase letter 'i'
I fly higher than a sci-fi flyer
This a European whip check the coupe design
Time is money is the building and the truth inside
Goon shoot ya in ya head make ya lose ya mind, for real...
It's Meek motherfucking Milly, uh
I said hoes, we never love them
We fuck them and then discuss them
And if you ain't fucking my man, you prolly fucking my cousin
There's nothing, how do we want it
Um, um amazing
Better yet a buffet
You can get all three
But I don't get her number, I tell her to call me
Phone rings she with her friends and they want to party
I tell her meet me, hotel room 13
I be there in a little
Looking all sexy, screaming daddy come get it
The dream gods tell me twice, I be right in it
Shorty wetter than a pool, I dive up in it like I'm swimming (splash)
Knocking bitches off, daddy this ain't nothing new
I'm Shaggy baby, would you let my dawgs Scooby Doo
She said that's crazy but I tell her this is what we do
Rolling through the block (uh)
Benjis on rock (uh)
Bad bitch on my back, at the twelve o'clock
T-5 barking on them
PT5 tour ass on them
Cops come, double clutch, fist tell that corner on them
Ride hard, fly it off like a Maserati
Getting low when I'm rolling, she gon' ride, she my Bonnie
My mommy, little hottie
Vanilla Ice, check out her eyes and her body
My little right thing
Like if you ain't fucking or sucking, don't even jump in the whip
She ain't tell her to holler
Grinding, chopping on choppers
Still M.O.B., mommy's don't get a dollar
I'm trying to fuck you for free, if you tricking don't even bother
I'm a P.I.M.P., naked bitches in the 'scala
Put a blue and white Yankees shirt, striped polo with the collar (free)
But everybody know my name
Plus I got that fire man, Puff just called me Lil Wayne
And I got a little game
Hoes feeling a nigga's swag
Tryna fuck and suck me just to get their niggas mad
See this, I just sit and laugh
If I get a piece of pie, my man gonna slice that
Breakdown, take down, shorty keep your mouth shut
This is what we do, 102, we ain't about that
I don't give a fuck, I leave you stuck like a mousetrap
Middle of the city, tell your rubber to get with me, nigga
Bitch
Picture me giving niggas a portion when I can hit the dealer and buy all my killers Porsches
They gon' slide on you if I tell them ride on you
Suddenly when it hit you, somebody done lied  to you
Fucking famous bitches, countin' paper
Check, check, check
I got shit about you, I won't say it
Pay to watch your mouth, you keep on quiet
I'm gon flame on you bitches, play no games with you bitches, no way
Used to hail lord for you, now I'm swinging that cake
So if you ride with my opps, then get the fuck out the way, hoe
Choppa style goons lurking when the sun down
Haters throwing bullets trying to get a touchdown
You catch them like Fitzgerald hommie when that clip spill
Beat their appeal make it home then get killed
Cause shit real nigga up in Philadel
I wet you and leave a hole in your head like killer whale
Free Willy and Meek Milly
He really bout that ask a nigga vouch that
Rappers actors like Samuel L. Jackson
You throwing money, you ain't even own a crib yet
You ain't even buy that Playstation for your kids yet
But you making it rain you a fucking lame
Y'all lames man
I'm in the SRT with an ACP
My sneaks ACG put out an APB
I make my bars go together like the ABC
I'm the club throwing dubs sipping A-C-E, spado
Ain't talking Tony when we say that yayo
In the kitchen we Miracle Whipping like its mayo
We hit the block and hit the rock like Ay-o
On the grizzy my shooters with me call them O.J. Mayo, woah!
North Philly where I be at
All black Dickie hoodie on and my P hat
Maserati with the auto start where the key
Where the key at, I don't know
You got money I got money the difference is mine show
How real is this
Chilling in the cut higher than a Louis tag
When the biddies see me I remind them of a Gucci bag
Cause they want me and they need me
I'm like Seymour, feed me

Hoes want to pop the kid cause I'm on T.V
Meek Milly, I’m running this rap shit
215 we running this rap shit
Philly, ah

Me and old Melly and my old school clique
With a 45th of Volv, but some old school shit
Light skinned 32, that’s my old school chick
Why you hating, the money that I’m making?
I’m fly like [?] before he dropped a statement
I ain’t fronting, I ain’t faking
I’m up early in the morning, going hard for the paper
The shit all on these rappers like a fucking number 2
I say I be coming through, Rolex be summer blue
Fresher than Will B, my homies be stunting too
And I brought the mac with me, and I ain’t talking Charlie
Harley, them shells smoke you, Bob Marley
Gnarly, I’m cooler than that white boy, surfing
If you throw your chick at me Imma catch em
Ain't I ain't I ain't I
Ain't I on some shit
Ain't I fuck your bitch
Ain't I Grand Hustle
Ain't I fuck with TIP
I just spit that shit and he gon' bring it back like replay
I come from the east side, run shit like a relay
Bunch of Philly killers with me they all look like Freeway
You can catch me in the hood probably somewhere don't belong
I keep with my tre pound long
His clip hold like 33 that's three circles from a brick
On some shit, that's your bitch
No it ain't cause she ours
Pull up to the club we be on Banshees and CRs
Ask about us who we are
I'm a young king I'm wassup
Ask your ho I do my thing
I was locked up in the pen but still I shine like I was bling
On the block with that Yao Ming
Tryna move that China white
Ya I grind like I ain't even about to blow like dynamite
I'm that Bull just call me Mike
I change hoes just like they're clothes
I change O's just like they're floors
And keep my money for them hoes
I keep money on re-load
I keep cash up in this stack
And I just laugh, Joe me like GI
Bitch I'm trying to fuck you, you keep worrying about TI
Haters they can see I'm all about my BI

Lotta niggas hate cause we be moving like the mob
West Philly back block that's where you find me at
State they got my nigga Dean

I just hit a lick, all white bricks
Fuck the drought we be flipping like a light switch
Ask my nigga [?] he got a [?]
We like a junkyard, we stay with metal shit
I can do it right or I can do it wrong
You buy it soft, try to cook it you be losing homes
Neef Buck told me get them where I fit in
The mac look great but its gorgeous with the clip in
Disrespect and we check 'em like an ACG
They say your green not fire
Your white not oil
You niggas at loyal when you shining like foil
Hottest in the city, hottest in the city
Hottest in the city, ain't nobody gon' top it
Hottest in the city, hottest in the city

They let me out the cell I was popping like I'm Diddy
Then Omelly came to scoop me with a chopper and a fifty

Off the backboard playa, I enjoy to bank
Plus my people smoking on that pack, noise complaint

But this the house of love homie, word to Courtney's place
Party hard then head to Europe on a early flight
Walking 'cross the London Bridge, that's that Fergie life

Welcome to my house party party
Yeah, I gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed
So tell me, how does it feel
To lose the one you believe in
I make you drop it on a Tuesday
I had the park on, poppin', we made a movie
So many feelings involved, the way you do me
Got one shot to do what it takes
Got no time for no mistakes
I see the light 'cause I'm hazy
They tried to hold me, but I didn't
Every time you text me
And by the time I'm replyin'
It's too late
Now I feel a way, way, yeah
Oh, and I gave you more
Yeah, I gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed
So tell me, how does it feel
To lose the one you believe in
Yeah, I confess, I wasn't ready but I was pressed
I was caught up in the lights from all the jets
All the pretty hoes, the X and Os, the diamonds, VVS
They was shinin', I was blinded, you was dope as CVS
What the fuck I was thinkin'?
The fuck I was drinkin'?
Runnin' 'round with these bitches
Our relationship sinkin' (Ooh)
Half a mill on her finger
Spent a Abraham Lincoln
Caught you textin' that nigga
I guess you gotta get even, damn
It was gettin' scarier
Never thought that I would see them times and I'd be tearin' up
Thinkin' 'bout the times of what we was and what we have now
We build again and I won't tear back down, I promise
Yeah, I gave you more than you wanted (Wanted, yeah)
I gave you more than you needed (Needed)
To lose the one you believe in
It's never been about us
You didn't say it, but you get it
You shouldn't hurt, but me but I let it
I feel like things are not the same
No, I feel a way, oh-oh
And by the time I reply
It's too late
Yeah, I gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed (Oh right)
So tell me, how does it feel
It's how we roll
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold
Yeah! We in control nigga!
Everytime I pull up, bitches they be like what up
Everything that I got now I got it because I stood up
I bought another Rolls
I started from selling O's, now my bank account seven O's
And there's two commas on it
And I'm getting higher nigga, riding with Gotti nigga
In back of the Fisker, and I ain't mention the Rarri' nigga
Bitches like 'Bari nigga, oh
Boats and hoes, money, cars, and clothes
Soon as we hit the party it's choices on all these hoes
We fucking all of they bitches, you niggas is getting old
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold
I'm standing on the couch like fuck life
And we just pulled up in a million dollar worth of cars
Million problems, thousand guns, just a couple dogs
Black man's black 40 cal, black Tahoe
Conversations with Meek about shit we did in the streets
How we fucked with our dogs, how we planning to eat
Bricked the rapper on the beat, hundred k in a week
Its CMG, MMG, everybody else enemy
Fuck boats and hoes, Cuban links in gold
Since that the role that they chose (fuck em!)
Send them hittas up to their door (murder)
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes
Panamera's, Ferrari's, and Royce's is how we roll
Young niggas is in control
Real niggas will never fold
I ain't dead but I'm the president
Money green, dutch for the medicine
Switch it up, up to the nose it's heroin
The city on fire, we let it burn
Smoke got the BM-Dubb moving like a hovercraft
Off the highway and she trafficking Marilyn Monroe
Front door she passing it (let me get that)
Cause most times the corners are a gold mine
Out the hood now we shooting for the coast line
Boats and hoes, below deck with them bricks nigga
Ace Diamond
We back nigga
Fucking with that other shit
It's New B
I'm a bad motherfucker, how you love that
Keep a super bad bitch, how you love that X 2
How you love that, the mafia be thugging
30 deep shake down hit the panic button
Dial 911 it's an emergency
Hey damn shitting on this niggas certainly
Champagne flutes, convertible coupes
She attracted to the lime life, she serving the troops
So when she coming through I tell her bring my money too

The only thing on my resume, it's the trap and the kitchen
I'm addicted to fast cars, money and bitches

Used to grind in apartments, ...fuck on the car ...
All this ice on, yeah my diamond's a conflict
My girl got a girl they claiming they partners

And they all get money like me
Quarter milli on a nigga white tee
And yall niggas still hating on it, still hating on it

But I'm strapped up & I'm waiting on it
These niggas ain't built like that
These niggas get killed like that
And they wonder why I feel like that
Cause every other month, I make a mill like that
Took my whole family up out that hood
Set 'em all nice in the hills like that, shit real like that
You ain't gotta like my shit, paid for the flow, I don't write my shit
Better pray to God I don't like your bitch
Cause if she catch eye then she might get hit! Woah!
Ain't me, ain't me, these pussy ass niggas ain't me
Got a couple main hoes that I'm fucking round with
But this one bad bitch you can't see
And all my niggas get straight to the money, these stones all clear HD

Your dreams aren't manifesting correctly
The kid is back uh , turn me up Cruz
This year it's all about us so fuck the other side
Well shit we dead already from all this homicide
In my cell hangin' from a rope
Where you get less time for rape than for sellin' dope
When you get the same time for dope then you do a murder
Innocent 'til guilty, guilty the verdict
Cause we was goin' to war with ourselves over that coca
And they was tryna hurt us, lock us so far in the mountains
Couldn't get no service and our families couldn't service us
Fightin' a silent war with a silencer
Like racin' a Lamborghini with a Challenger
And the feds gon' follow us
And we turn to media, they lie to us
Nobody really speakin' on them courtrooms that bodied us
Labeled us as hooligans, we trappin' and we movin' it
Kids barely eatin' at that table with that tuna fish
Breakfast and lunchtime Mama ordered the noodle dish
Dinner time I was on the corner, me and Lucifer
Nobody
Talked to the Shmurdas and I told 'em keep their head up
And when you touch down, stay focused and get your bread up
Cause when you're gettin' to it the people be gettin' fed up
They buildin' brand new jails for us, don't make your bed up
Use your head, dog, and beware
Certain niggas just ain't good for you dont bring them near ya
I'm young, black, and I get money, my swag serious
America's worst nightmare, I'm what they're scared of
I come back home, they talkin' Nicki now?
I spit like a drummer that hold 50 rounds
And for my walkthroughs it cost 60 pounds
But that hood shit bring the hood out of me
I be on the 'gram like I hit the lottery
Buyin' every car, every house I see, tryna be
A gangsta, I was tryna be a king
You're tryna score a point, I was tryna get a ring
Couple niggas got happy, heard I was in the bing
'Til they let me out my cell, I jumped right up in that sink
Balenciaga red interior, they're inferior
I made a couple milli in jail, I'm dead serious
Monkey ass hoes like George and head curious
I'm talkin' to Hov on the jail call
Get so many letters that they thinkin' it's mail fraud
We got like, 6 mansions, 12 lofts
3 condos, any apartments? Hell naw
Just all penthouses, nigga I've been 'bout it
Gets in, gets out it, like it's a robbery
I came up from the bottom and ain't no stoppin' me nigga
I don't know what these niggas trippin' on
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Don't say my name unless you suicidal
Don't get to close unless you suicidal
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Money won't ease us
Man niggas even hated on Jesus
Living life on the road on the chase for the money
Cause the hoes won't please us
Now she fuck with a G
Got your bitch not wanting to speak
Hold up, y'all mahfuckers tried to shit on us
Chain all lit all up
Porsche with the horse like get on up
And my bitch got that shit on her
Rock Balmain cause I'm ballin'
And no more red bottles
Straight Belarie nigga every bottles
Ricky Rozay we in here
Double M G we've been here
Straight from the north side
Right by the project how did I get here
Sippin' on lean with a bad ass bitch
From the Hills, probably live there
And get money like me
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
I don't know what these niggas speakin' off
I don't know what these niggas trippin' on
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
There's no love in the streets and this blood on my sneaks got suicide on them
Going everywhere you are not going
Doing everything you are not doing
Right back to the money my nigga no we don't play
Say my name and that's D.O.A
And all these chains is saying we okay
And we drink Champagne, eat Frito Lays
At lunchtime, do it for the ghetto one time
Cause the watch say bust down and the whole band is drumline
Me and my nigga, Rozay that's my nigga
D-Boy, that's my hitter
None of y'all can fuck with us
None of y'all gossip, Jigga
Give me my throne, and you ain't gonna like my picture
Leave a comment, fuck nigga
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Don't get to close unless you suicidal
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
You must be suicidal
When we pull up, watch the suicide doors
I've been too deep, make 'em call the 5-0
If he surprised, I know that gun go
BLAT, BLAT, BLAT, BLAT
Man I'm so on
We ridin' 'round, we gettin' money
Don't touch my niggas
I suggest you don't
I don't know what these niggas speakin' off

Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Don't say my name unless you suicidal
Don't get to close unless you suicidal
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Stepping off that Lear, diamonds on me so clear
Dime hoes that I share, y'all couldn't go near
I say, pussy nigga I dare, you try and reached and get aired
You fuck around and get checked, doctor pump your chest like clear
Yea my niggas ball all year, y'all niggas so square (lame)
And all my niggas so live, why the fuck would I care
When that Lambo flow by, y'all suckas gon' stare
And all them haters gon' hate, fuck them, 'cause all them hoes gon' cheer
'Cause I'm countin' green in my money machine, that bitch sound like I typewrite
Hustle hard in that daytime but I ball off in that night life
My chain lit with them black stones, but they shine hard as yo white ice
'Cause yo' shit fake and yo shit late, no birthday but I get cake
Nigga smoking that Cali kush, that shit strong no lift weights
I tell niggas don't watch me while time tick on that big face
Young nigga I get it, young nigga I get it
Neck full of that gold, gold Rollie go with it
Gold H on my belt, phone full of gold diggers
Sipping gold bottles of Spade, tell them hoes go figure
Neck full of that gold, gold Rollie go with it
Sipping gold bottles of Spade, tell them hoes go figure
Wake me up and I'm snoring, choking over whole gang of chains
And we dipping out, she pulling in, I guess she get the hang of things
When I run my mouth diamonds falling out, I guess that bitch done nut up
Crazy thing about it, her best friend is riding shotty
I knocked her down in her 'Rari, then drove off on Ducatti
Damn Tony them cantaloupes, fuck about getting Mary
She said her ex was Larry, but fuck that nigga Larry
Fucking with that white milk, just might call it dairy
Sit behind while we pull around, we might blind with canaries
Neck full of that gold, gold Rollie go with it
Gold H on my belt, phone full of gold diggers
Sipping gold bottles of Spade, tell them hoes go figure
Young nigga I get it, young nigga I get it
Neck full of that gold, gold Rollie go with it
Gold H on my belt, phone full of gold diggers
Rather eat crumbs with bums 'fore I split my steak with you snake ass niggas
I rather stay down with my day ones 'fore I come around you fake ass niggas
I rather have a broke real bitch 'fore I ever deal with y'all fake ass bitches
And I ain't with the flooding on the 'gram I don't really fuck with you, don't take my picture nigga
Posted on the corner with a 40 on my hip, Godzilla
We was getting to it when they hit my nigga Dean, that's when shit got realer
I was on the Southside really outside got guns got killers
Started from the bottom of the bottom now its bottles popping in the sky villa
Catch a body, be about it
I'm from where you couldn't talk you ain't be about it
I ain't really with the talkin', let's be G about it
And these niggas get to talking like they know me
Finna turn me to the old me
Should've listened to my momma when she told me
Now these bitches throwing pussy cause they owe me
I got the juice, nigga I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice when I hop out the coupe
When I hop out the coupe
Real niggas I'mma salute
Cause I got the juice, I got the juice
Counting million dollars gon' fuck something
Put an eight up in my Phantom I don't want none
Nigga looking I don't tuck nothing
My nigga Ernie got thirty trying to slump something
I make the call to Arizona and the truck coming
Take a bird to the table we don't front nothing
I'm a north nigga at the end of the day
Gun butt a nigga with the end of the K
Don't come around here like your niggas are safe
Fuck if you with 'em
Its money and murder if you fuck with my niggas
I fucked all them bitches cause
Nigga I got the juice when I hop out the coupe
When I hop out the coupe
Cause I got the juice, I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice, she popping pussy
Like I'm Uncle Luke
Cause I got the juice
All she ever wanted was a trap nigga
Every time you ever saw me I was strapped nigga
Getting blunted in the back nigga
No this ain't a 550, this a Bach, nigga
Nigga prolly spend your car money on that act nigga
Couple bands, 5 racks nigga
You call it beefin' when you '@' niggas
We call it beefin' when we clap niggas
I got the juice, nigga I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice when I hop out the coupe
Real niggas I'mma salute
Cause I got the juice, I got the juice
Nigga I got the juice
Load up the chopper screaming R.I.P. Snupe
Go head and blame it on me, We ain't going to blame it on you
We ain't going to blame it on that, we ain't going to aim on you
Got your phone on silent all vibrating the sheets.When they took me to jail, thought you was waiting on me
Messing with the same old lames that was all hating on me.All that shit you said all them lies you told
All that shit you did, those fake dreams you sold.It don't take rocket scientist to figure why I'm so cold
Got a ice box in my chest , girl my heart on froze
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
I was fucked up, but bitch I'm back
I wasn't in the club ho cause I was in the trap
I tell 'em how you like me now?
Cause I be shinin' like a diamond, I got money in my pocket
I don't even have to press, I see it, like it, I'ma cop it, oh!
I see it, like it, I'ma cop it, oh!
I see it, like it, I'ma cop it, nigga, what's the topic?
Started from the bottom, now, I really got it poppin'
Same hoes that fronted back, they want it, now I got it
Cause I'm ballin', I'm talking Spaldin'
Rollie on my wrist, flooded like New Orleans
A nigga buzzin' now, I'm talking hornets
Cause I murder all my enemies, stretch my opponents
Zombies in my neighborhood, shit is like Thriller
And I'm Mike Jackson cause I'm they dealer
In my zipped-up jacket and my neck on chiller
Going hard is gettin' scary, I swear it's gettin' scary
I put mirror tint all on this ghost and screamin' Bloody Mary
So when you see me Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary
A nigga play around with me, he get fuckin' buried
Comin' through the city, up in Philly, out with Meek
Make a hunnit every week so now I'm stuntin' like a Sheikh
And we do this shit for PA, we do this shit for PA
How I use to get it dirty, now my money come the clean way
Blindfold on me, doing 100 down the freeway
Bitch, I came right out that circus shit, youngin' but i'm learning quick
Murder this, burn your kids, then call up child services
And they ain't even gotta ask, they know that Mac workin'
Act certain, smoke a fuckin' beat like it's a Nat Sherman
Go ahead and hand me a rapper
I'ma chew his ass up like he a animal cracker
Spit straight venom, give you bars like it's a state prison
Yeah, I'm still scruffy, gettin' money
Got all these writers mad cause they daughters wanna fuck me
Woo! Woo!

Remix!
(One two, one two)
This the I'ma Boss Remix
Meek Milly
I'm ride or die as I'm ridin’ by, holla Westside right inside of my
Bimmer 760i, try me let off sixty shots
Again we got the city hot and popping like it ‘posed to be
Hoes who not ménaging got no business standing close to me
So cold, a ferocious G, niggas ain't as dope as me
Mind your fuckin’ business, watch your mouth when you approachin' me
I fuck with hoes who fuck with hoes, do pills and powder socially
I like 'em, I don't love ‘em though, cold heart emotionally
Captain where the ocean is, riding in the Ghost again
Slap you with a lot of spit until she swallow all of it
Call the shots, run the shit, on some big money shit
You all talk dawg, flaw and I ain't having none of that
I'm big boss dawg, floss all day and run it back
Bitch, I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We in this bitch, it’s going down
You just buy that motherfucker and you throw that shit on
You be popping them tags, we just throw it in bags
And then we hit the fucking block, we be droppin' them rags
Started with a dollar, turn it to a M
You should see how people treat you when that money coming in
Bad bitches calling cause I'm balling
And I'm parking Aston Martins where they walking, these niggas ain't important
They informants really talking when the people get to honking
I'm a boss really, Nino or Al Pacino
Hundred racks on this Rollie, it light up like a casino
Niggas really be fraud, I’ma keep it a C-note
Everybody praying for me, I respect that
Woke up in the hospital, where my checks at
Then I put eight chains, where my neck's at
Hopping in the Ghost, I feel I'm dead set
Worth 40 M's so respect that
I put all my jewels on just to bone your chick
You know the boss well known for leavin' bonuses
We making money, may it marinate
When the work clean, cut it like it’s carrot cake
D-boys love the way I narrate
I still whip it like it's Anna Mae
Remember Momma had a Cavalier
Better check the stats, we fillin' arenas
And I got the gats, Gilbert Arenas
Bitch, I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
We in this bitch, it’s going down
Yeah, I'm the king, now where my muhfucking crown?
You a boss, you a boss
Seven five, seven showers on her
Spend about thirteen hours on it
7-57 with the showers on it
We spent about thirteen hours on it
Look, I be probably on my skateboard, tryna learn a new trick
I just fucked an Avatar, now I got a blue dick
Money talks, bullshit walks if the shoe fit
You pushing up daisies, daffodils, tulips
I point the pistol at you like a camera phone
I'm Young Money, Cash Money, I'm not human
I’m tryna get money, money like Mark Cuban
If she don’t respect me, she gon' respect this dick
The world is an asshole and we the next big shit
Damn right I gang bang, tell 'em blood up slime
Fuck! I had to say fuck one time, get it
When I came up in this bitch I was shining every summer
Took the whole thing, the young nigga doing numbers
Candy on the Ave, candy on the slab
Hundred Gs nigga, Cash Money millionaires
Hundred mil nigga, how we flipped it off the ave
Blood rich gang, you know we filthy nigga
Moving all around, new fleets with my round
Touch another town, putting it all down
Pop a hundred bottles bitch, we wear the crown
Bitch, I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We in this bitch, it’s going down
Yeah, I'm the king, now where my muhfucking crown?
Started off poor with plans to own more
Now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores
I was on tour with niggas that sold raw
Started sellin' white, we won't sell it no more
I'm like, Trump ain't feelin' us, cops still killin' us
Niggas takin' shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough
New Dawn, Hermes seat, I let the ceiling up
Just to kill 'em softly, ooh, get 'em off me
Try to crucify me like I'm Jesus the way she cross me
I'm too bossy and too thorough
To move like a weirdo, on point like an arrow
Diamonds like water and they jumpin' out the gym
Shootin' like Harden if your head was the rim
'Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim, damn
Back when I was broke, they was cool with it
Even if I ain't do it they be like "You did it!"
That's why I never went to school nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
No weapon formed against me every time I pray at night
Scoopin' thotties in the Phantom, that's the way of life
And make 'em fuck their best friends like they was dykes
I'm with the pack, uh, gettin' back, yeah
Spendin' dope, nigga, sellin' smack, gang
I'm gettin' chips off music like Rap Snacks
Yeah, 10 mil in cash of Ethika, that's a fact
I know these niggas upset, they ain't see me fall yet
They wanna see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us
Bloggers in a frenzy, truck to the Bentley
Ain't doin' no interviews, I'm busy, nigga we litty
So when you see me out don't ask me about no Nicki
Fuck I look like tellin' my business on Wendy
Niggas gossip like queens, we was servin' fiends
.40 bust your windows out: Jazmine Sullivan
They told 'em pop Mollys, I told 'em to be kings
Sippin' 1942 like it's lean
I done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
I know it, I go through it, don't show it
I told niggas who wrote it, ain't takin' back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half
Turned that to an ounce, got some shit in the stash
Nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass
And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag
Had to starve all day just to get to it fast
Like Ramadan, totin' K's like it's Palestine
Ever since I met Ross and signed the dotted line
I gave my momma 10,000 at least a thousand times
Do the math on it!
They wanna see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
Talkin', this my cocky flow
Damn Daniel, why you son him? Mr Miyagi though
This that rose gold Patek, call me like '94
Mean nothin' to me, I tell you how it gotta go
Rain, sleet, on that corner when the block was slow
Everybody was tryna trap, we started poppin' though
Heard that bitch say she cut me, I was like "¡adiós!"
In the field, knock 'em down, it look like dominoes
When you get a dollar they gon' hate
Bought my mom the crib with that gate
They wanna see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us
Yeah, yeah, baby, is you drunk? Is you had enough?
Got the club goin' crazy

Yo, he was the realest, I was the baddest, we was the illest
When he approached me, I said, "Yo what the deal is?"
Now it's all eyes on us, and this all lies on trust
And if them bitches wanna trip, tell 'em they tour guide's on us
This kitty cat on reclusive, he duck, duckin' them gooses
He was like (What's your name?) My name Nick
(Where you from?) New York in this bitch
(Choose and pick) You got the right one
All them hoes, ain't nothin' like them

Question
What does an old head and a young bull have in common?
Know the answer, anbody's liable to snitch
Real niggas stand up Philly Flamers
Stand up niggas caught their cases took the time
I know niggas that was OGs ratted on their own team
Took their whole clique down time for them to sit down
Same niggas acting tough tell them you a bitch now
Real niggas stand up
And if you did it then there's consequences nigga man up
I remember them hungry day cutting them grams up
I stack a couple hundreds just to save a grand up
From a hundred dollars to a hundred thousand
Get you a couple bricks flood the hood like public housing
I was in the stands just watching like I was scouting
Pepping out all the players, balling Dion Waiters
Niggas in my hood are suckers beyond haters
Act hard but melt faster than Now & Laters
I just take a point I grab my the nine later
Rules to the game laugh now and cry later
Fast cars, fast bitches
Live the fast life you better fall fast nigga
And fuck a first place as long as I ain't last nigga
And I'm in the race, I'm too hungry to let a nigga taste
You trying to reach catch them in your face
It ain't my birthday I'm getting cake
Writing [?] the feds got him up in VA
And free my nigga Lil' they got him upstate PA
State gave my nigga Rick [?] life
I was five I seen them lock my dad casket tight
And since then I've been clutching on the ratchet tight
It was '05 moving birds Boston Market
Boss of the corner chilling in my corner office
It was all good, paper flowing like the Nile River
In the winter rocked the mink and in the summer dropped the top on 'em
Every other day different watch on 'em
They my niggas switched sides on me
Said they gon' ride on me
Shot me in front of my son he was just five hommie
Should've [?] cause a nigga went insane
Kingpins run the game nigga never been afraid
Bullet wounds still bleeding niggas bang them niggas back
Get rocks sold up that's how we live in this habitat
Never rat real deal, I was never an impostor
Cops sounding like Biggie Smalls asking who shot you
Don't worry about it pig, I'll handle my own
Call up [?] bang on niggas like I'm alone
One minute you a kingpin chilling with a mink
Most niggas here going to die before their grandfather
Niggas did [?] like Rottweiler
No gas in his crib so he can't take a hot shower
Grab his 30 gage [?] give a nigga hot shower
Cause they can't afford a burger or a fucking Caesar Salad
That's real
I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more
Yeah, niggas be seeing me stunting, know I'm getting all these dollars
I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more
Nigga still getting these hundreds, know I got all of these (all I want, all I need)
Damn, look what you started
We done turned my crib into an after party
And all I really wanna do, all I really wanna do, hey
Is put my hands on your body, just roll up with you
All I want is you, all I want is you
All a nigga want is you
Liquor got me stupid
Now, baby, tell me what you want to do, hey (all I want, all I need)
Hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Little bit of hood with a swag like Left Eye
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Pussy so good, want to put in a rap line
Plus 5, plus 5, she was that fine, go to sleep all in it like nap time (woo! Oh Lord)
She woke up like this with her ass all on me from the backside
She want to do the surfboard, just tryna be like Beyoncé (surfboard)
And if she always do it this good then she might just be my fiancée (wife her)
I want more, I want more and now damn, I want yours
Thinking like how did we get on the floor?
From the couch to the bed when we came in the door
And I came from the door like
Damn, look what you started
We done turned my crib into an after party
And all I really wanna do, all I really wanna do, hey
All I want is you, all I want is you
All a nigga want is you
Liquor got me stupid
Now, baby, tell me what you want to do, hey (all I want, all I need)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Damn, look what you started
We done turned my crib into an after party
And all I really wanna do, all I really wanna do, hey
Is put my hands on your body, just roll up with you
All a nigga want is you
Liquor got me stupid
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
I know that you fake niggas ain't real (ha, ain't real)
That's why we take your girls and make money, make money (get money)
A double cup and a whole bag of them pills (why?)
I hear them on the pole and they shake something, shake something (let's get it)
Damn, look what you started
We done turned my crib into an after party
Is put my hands on your body, just roll up with you
All a nigga want is you
Liquor got me stupid
Now, baby, tell me what you want to do, hey (all I want, all I need)
Catch you out in traffic, it's you and I
Gold 41 in a suit and tie, nigga it's do or die
Seen it now, if I lose it all like who would ride?
But nigga I'm so up, if I tripped it's like suicide
I was on the block when you was a sneakerhead
Nigga ain't no Nike, ain't no Yeezy, no Jordan V
I came back like I'm Mike wearin' 45
Ever seen 50 grand when it's all in 5s?
Only rapper went gold without a verse from Hov
Still got the rock with me, cookin' up at the stove
And the Rollie all platinum, know I bust it at Joe
Maybach in the hood, so them suckers can know
Bout to go and grab the Benz truck, see y'all later
This is slaughter, new world order
I be goin' hard, Westbrook, 4th quarter
I don't know how they gettin' down 'cross the border
I give 'em the dirty flow, Michigan and water
Sent them 10 thousand cases, I put in my order
Call that poppin' bottles when my people can't afford it
Mixin' D'usse with lemonade when I'm in Georgia
Views from the projects, and nigga I'm the prospect
Talkin' loud, say I'm shootin' out with metal objects
And that chick standin' right beside you, I done popped that
Made me beat a fan up, I'm feelin' like I'm Artest, woo!
Gold mic from the billboards, 'bout to plug it up
Tell Cruz put it in the booth so I can fuck it up
Got the hood super lit, jumpin' like it's double dutch
You niggas all the way fucked
Switched sides, now you stuck (stay over there my g)
This is
They don't wanna see you on top
I just wanna see the streets up
That's it
They gon' take shots when you all the way up
I guess they gotta aim up at you
But don't you let these nobodies get their name up on you
If she for everybody, don't you let her claim up on you
Now listen, you gave up on me, I came up on you
Took my talents somewhere else, LeBron James up on you
I was Kyrie with the rock, the crack game number 2
Now I'm older, still ballin' like my name Uncle Drew
They tell you... stay the same, but they change up on you
Niggas change up the crew like hoes change up their boo
I just played the cards they dealt me 'til a change-up was due
Guess I had to switch the dealer or just change up the shoe
Now blackjack, Ace of Spade and a shot of Jack
I met a bad actress, she ain't know how to act
I took her but I brought her back
Don't want her back, I bought her bag
Matte like Hasselbeck, I call my car a quarterback
If I threw it at her would you doubt she could catch?
Ain't about throwin' subs, I'm about gettin' scratches
But if the shoe fits, nigga, buy an outfit to match it
And you know my boys hold it, we be out with the ratchets
I heard your boys told her you be out with the rats
Keep that on the "Shhhh!”, nothing less, nothing more
What's up with your Warriors? They ain't lookin' tough no more
Should get out your feelings bro, and get in your duffle, boy
Level up, level up, it's all about that level up
Hold that fuckin' bezel up and light this bitch all the way up
All the way up
All the way up
And everytime you see me nigga
Man I'm all the way up
This is
Edsclusive
Uhh, haa
Days I figured why not, ha-ha
Meek called me and Fab, Joe called Jigga up
She jumped in the 6, 550 wasn't big enough
They can tread water, but they can't swim enough
Nah, I'm built for the physical outing
Besides that, I'm filthy, like municipal housing
I be in all the hood spots you not allowed in
Opps in the building, automatically alert that
Hand on the wrist so the chrome don't jerk back
Pull it out, you already know you gotta squirt that
You gon' need the key from the lobby to slide up
Born with it then you don't gotta get signed up
Gotta go when you gotta go, your times up
Extendos, no need for keeping the 9's tucked
I'm kicking you off the ladder for trying to climb up
Yup, overlooking the city
It's 50 in the bank, who rollin'? Shoot the 50
If I ace, then these niggas think they hit me
But I'm-
All the way up
Haa
I'm all the way up
All the way up
All the way up
And everytime you see me nigga
Man I'm all the way up
I even bought you diamonds, put you in that double C
The way you love the game, you couldn't be in love with me
I work too hard for my name to let a bitch put mud on me
So how can I trust you? (Trust you)
When all the rich niggas fucked you (Fucked you)
Make you my baby, I'd love to (Love to)
You was a dime, but I dubbed you (Dubbed you)
When I first bagged you that shit had me excited
Swimming in that pussy, girl, I swear there's nothing like it
I got plans to cut you off, I know that you won't like it
I won't forget you, you a bad bitch (Bad bitch)
I set you up so you could level up (Level up)
But you was used to being average (Average)
Jumpin' on jets, you was caught up in the life
They gassed you on Instagram, you caught up in the hype
A ho gon' be a ho, so ain't no use for no advice
When you crossed me, you lost me, can't let you cross me twice
I almost fell in love with a thottie (Oh)
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light (Come to the light)
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right (Fuckin' me right)
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice (Talk to me)
You fucking with a ball player and now you acting bougie
Seen you out in traffic you act like you never knew me
I just bust out laughing when I seen with you that goofy (Ha)
I almost fell in love with a ho
I still dream of me fuckin' you slow
Ass so fat all the stuff from the back
It's so wet, it's slippery, it let me fall in
And from the way you treated me, almost went all in (All in)
'Cause relationships turn into situationships
I know you don't wanna hear this player shit, but baby I'm made for this
You made your bed, you gotta lay in it
My heart can't play with this (No)
Gotta save myself before I try to save a bitch (Woah)
I ain't been cuffing on no hoes and I ain't gon' start
Had to Patek my wrist, protect my heart (Protect my heart)
Had to Patek my wrist, protect my heart
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light (Come to the light)
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right (Fuckin' me right)
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice (Talk to me)
Ugh, I gotta keep a vest on my heart (On my heart)
You the reason the good women got it hard (Got it hard)
Shit, we was good until our feelings got involved
That's when I did my homework and then I really got involved, oh
Oh, and I don't know how I'ma go 'bout it
Now a nigga coldhearted, baby, nobody
Found out you a whole thottie
And you got a whole lotta bodies, nobody
No, you let what we had die young (Die young)
And that's word to Lil Roddy (Lil, no, no)
Soon as I thought I got one, I was like
I almost fell in love with a thottie (Oh)
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light (Come to the light)
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right (Fuckin' me right)
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice (Talk to me)
My ambition as a rider
Yeah, it's my ambition as a rider
Hey, it's my ambition as a rider
Loccin', loading toasters, pussy you was not there
Holding, never folding, we was on the top tier
Shackled to our ankles it was like a nightmare
You ever wash out your drawers on the same water you shit?
Doing your push ups right on the floor where you piss?
You got to rumble from night time down to the morning and shit
Clutchin' that pistol, God made me rebellious
Fuck with them niggas, teach you a lesson
Fingers on triggers, meet Smith and Wesson
Throw the money let it burn on 'em
My ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Money the root of evil, wait 'til them shooters see you
Lurkin in Grand Marquises, scopin' on you, your people
Made a movie with niggas, murder and you the sequel
Bullets gon' riddle you, they gon' use tubes to feed you
Momma gonna pull the plug
Head big as Hey Arnold's is, full of blood
Smell the death in the air when we pullin' up
Bullets go B-B-BRRRR, fill 'em up
I repent when I murder opposites
Pick and roll, stop and pick
I reload, spin the corner, drop the shit
And we leave no evidence for residents to grieve 'bout
And keep your eyes open 'til you start to wheeze out
My ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, my ambition as a rider
Oh, yeah, its my ambition as a rider
I just wanna thank God
For all the pretty women he let into my life
All the Benjamins you let me count
Wealth and health
And lettin' me ball on these niggas
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)

And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)
She wanna fuck and I say church (Preach)

Pull up in the Phantom, watch them bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime I step up in the dealer I be goin' broke
Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all

All this ice that's in my Rollie I be chilling
So I could take care of them children, let's go
Now there's a lot of bad bitches in the building (Amen)
A couple real niggas in the building (Amen)
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)

Just bought my niggas some caine, so much it came with a plane
I just bought me a crib so big it came with a moat
For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becomin the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life puttin on, you spend your whole life puttin up
Ain't no telling when I go, so there ain't shit that I'ma wait for
I'm the type to say a prayer, then go get what I just prayed for
I'm finna kill niggas in the building (Amen)
I tell the waiter fifty bottles and she tell me say when
And I say church (Preach)
We make it light up like a church (Preach)

Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm just tryna win
And if she knock I let her in
I'm screaming Oh Lord, that pussy good, that pussy good
I'm tryna hold on, I wish I could, you think I should
She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati
(Push it all on her) She was on that Reposado
(She take it all off) And I think I'll rep Serato
In this bitch I'm spending like I hit the lotto, cause it's a lot of...

The Richard Millie stole my wrist back

Roddy Ricch, all I know is popping rubber bands
I remember I was sitting in the projects
With a dollar bill, then I turned it into a hunnid bands

Straight outta Compton, I'm a rich nigga, I'm ruthless
Hopped in the dawn, I forget where the roof is
Nine millie, I'm a snap a bitch, I shoot, chill

Doctors got to try to fucking repair
Brain fragments now you in that wheelchair

After all of the time that I put in I deserve to ball
We ain't wrong at all
I done made my way to the top and I ain't falling off
We ain't wrong at all
Am I wrong cause I want to ball
Am I wrong for dropping fifty on this Audemar
Cause I remember times slinging dimes by that corner store
Risking my freedom, ditching them people

So they can shatter my dreams, now I'm a king
I'm riding Phantom Ghost you know that my passenger mean

Cause when we run into them ain't no pass for that
I don't want to hear niggas talking Nicki again
...cracking
We was in the clubs we was getting these brackets
And I was like damn how you getting in past him...
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad
And they say bad girls ain't no good
Good girls ain't no fun
I still can't find a nigga that touch that
And I ain't searching for it
Never trust but I'm working on it
Swimming pool, you surfing on it
They still think you a church girl
We linking up on your days off
And I still give you that work girl
Like work, twerk
Do it like that video
Cool with it, I get it though
First year we both fronted
We had feelings we didn't show
Second year we couldn't hide it
Funny part they didn't know
How could something that's so wrong feel so right?
But who to tell you this wrong, though? This your life
Word up
You bring out feelings in me I never show
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad
We just fucking up the city, going hard every night
Cause I broke a lot of hearts, ain't do them girls right
But you broke hearts too, but that boy ain't fight
Just look at my eyes and see what's inside
You know that it's pride, you say that I'm worth it
But said I ain't ready, really I'm ready
Really I'm ready, I'm ready like never before
I'mma just give you a key to my heart
You'll be the first that I let in the door
I used to hear that you flirt with them guys
They never would score
All you was hearing about me and the women
Ain't trust them before
You know what we on
And I got the mic so let me perform, sing it
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I can hear it in your voice you wasn't never in this shit nigga
We still at war
Sellin' dope, poppin' wheelies
When the feds came through, they scooped the whole South Philly
When the feds came through, they scooped the whole South Philly
We was grinding, they was hating
Perfect time to get this money, I was patient
Only one to keep it real, when they was faking
Ain't a nigga 'round me I ain't give a hundred bands to
Never falling out, about them bitches that we ran through
When you get the money, like I got it, they can't stand you
Fuck 'em, we at war with the system, in the streets
Bulletproof I'm in the trenches, niggas said that I got beef
And my homie lined my other homie up, 'cause he a creep
Show no love for that pussy ass nigga, it get deep
For the love of that Benji, we spillin' blood in them streets
And I know why they hate me, it ain't no love in them streets
He was hinting at work, we thought it was love it was cheap
He was sellin us that reerock, pumping us on that Reebok
Slid up on him wit three Glocks, did him dirty for three blocks
Turn that boy to a freeze pop, shoot 'em until it decock
Young niggas killing, all the old heads retiring
And the sound of that 30 start to sound inspiring
Please don't judge us, they done killed our brothers
We done starved all winter they gon feel our summers
I went drop top Dawn on 'em, we do numbers
And when we get a chance to rain on 'em, we gon' flood 'em
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em
I told 'em, I'mma pray for 'em
Catch a body, take it to the grave for me
And if they pop you off, you'll never change on me, no
Bag talk, put a bag on her, let that cash talk
Daddy was arrested so it’s dad's fault
Killed the niggas about you, you tell them that part?
Why you take it that far?
We the type to call the opps and have a standoff
Make a thottie call your homie, that's a man-off
They so used to the fake shit, they don't know what was real
All my enemies, frenemies, I don't know who to kill
I don't know who gon' keep it silent and know who gon' squeal
I don't know who was thurl
'Cause it all got fuzzy and came down to that money
I seen niggas eatin' from me, made me watch while I'm hungry
Bitches changed for the fame, you gotta watch them they phony
I don't know where I'm going, I need navigation
They came and got a young niggas 'for they graduation
Spent some time on that Patek still ain't got no patience
Gave my nigga 20 years, put him on vacation
Stars all in the ceiling, feel like it's a spaceship
They just killed my little cousin, wish I could've saved him
'Member times out in Vegas when we did it major
Niggas turned they back on us, I feel like they played us
Gotta watch these niggas close 'cause they been catchin' vapors
We get money ball hard
Get money ball hard
As I was riding through the city in my S550
Quiet chilly cause I ball Audemar like 20
And the diamonds on my neck be dancing on her get silly
Get with me, this Philly at its fineness I'm you highness
I'm a plus but you're a minus
Cause my mind be on the money and there's money on my mind
And I be in the mix like water
Not at all could you find it
Hit the club don't need I.D

Beat the track up like her name was Tina Turner
I got accountants for the accountants
I got lawyers for the lawyers
Fucking thick high yellow bitches somewhere out here foreign soil
I said I pull up to the scene so fresh so clean
That 7 4 pound with the window rolled down
Like 50 on my neck feel like the king no crown
I be Pradad down to death and all my gear be low down
Red horse, red strip, red Porshe, red lights
Tell me stop cause I'm killing them
Got change like a chameleon
And them lames they not feeling them but tell them keep hating
Praying on my down fall tell them keep waiting
I be here I be there
With the rocks don't ride no where
I'm so fly when I go leer
Why would I lie no I don't care
I ride that five without no fear
Keep that chopper on deck
If a nigga run up on me hit him up with no rap
We get money and ball hard
We drop that work in the pot whip all hard
And we take it to the block bring it back and its all ours
It’s the dream team bitch
Mr. Philadelphia
Jalil Beats, holla at me

Ballin and ballin, tearing up the Martin
Call me Mr. wrecking ball the way I break them walls in
Ain’t Shizzy a dope
Used to have weed, now they say the bottom got dope
Knew a nigga had soap, and they rocked his ass
Saw they did a round hit, and they stopped his ass
Million dollar nigga, they call him socks in the air
When them bullets from up top, man they started to spray
It’s just another story from around the way
Where we keep a tough crew and them boys don’t play
75 nigga ball, rest in peace to bubble

And all these diamonds around my neck, I put on two of them chinchillas

Bitches run around the lobby, boot 'em up, but no Timberlands
Your bitch pull up to my trap with no call
Like football she get penalties

A four, five, six shots, seven like eight claps
And the MAC 11 tucked in where da 12 gauge at
When I was 13 had 14 grams of ajax
Turned 15 start spitting 16s of straight crack
By 17, 18th street where I played that

Playin with my money like playin with my emotions
Floatin off that water like I'm layin in da ocean
Roastin, I make you disappear, hocus-pocus
We leave these suckas like they Jerry Rice, wide open
In da field to get real, ya block slow-motion
Gotta catch a nigga sleepin late night, stick em with the toaster

Pull up in the hood 4 door Mazeradi
Jewels on flashy like a paparazzi
Copy, I be probably in the hills out in Cali
In the million dollar crib eatin on shrimp and brocolli
Watch me, Pilladels Flyer, no hockey
Tell your chick to google me, she can dot com me

Got the goons on deck, they ride hard like Kowazakis
They ride hard, I said they ride hard
Kated by DTSes

We're competent, common sense, cause niggas, they rock this shit
From where they forever hate,you'll never get a compliment
I'd rather do a 5 to 10, nigga fore I lose my life
Go out in a blaze of glory, squezing with my trigga tight
Like damn where my nigga Rick
Damn where my nigga Brick
As time flies I think about you, know you tired and sick of it

Peepin out the scene, I see a hater I react
They call us the Ladder Boys cause we get it poppin

Got him in the Hell hole, livin at the speed of light
Prayin that the time fly by so he can see the light
See his kids meet a wife, all over a key of white
But why you think they take that time from you, cause you need it right?
And you can't get it back, so how they givin people life?
That's why I never waste time, I cherish every minute in
Man half that shit I make, I blow

Cause any given day could go
And I could see my death date, feel my last breath take
That's why I go and get it now
I be like shit wait
Die young, and the bag don't even last that
Where the young niggas 16 and over die fast at
I was made there, raised there but moved past that
Livin at the speed of light, it looked like a flash back
I don got money, went broke then got the cash back
That's why I never ever cherish nothin I can have back
Thankful for my life though, I wish I could stash that
Be here today, to cease tonight
I just hope when God come arrest me that he read my rights, read my wrongs, ah

You know I still believe, still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still, I raise up to take back the crown, yes
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down (Yeah, uh)
Follow your dreams, not your addictions
How we gon' follow our dreams locked in a prison?
Deprive me out of my dreams but I'm relentless
I want the money, ain't never want attention
'Cause they ain't see my vision
Glad when it was Christmas
We ain't even barely get presents, but we was gifted
In the school of failure, we present, perfect attendance
Welfare baby, we workin' with what they give us
Made me some commas, judge still gave me a sentence
No period, city girls don't get scared when it's really real
Thank God you believe, make sure you pray when you kneel, yeah
You know I still believe, still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Still, I raise up to take back the crown, yes
But you can't lock the soul of a man down (Yeah, uh)
My bank account, it was on super-zero
Ain't never panic, I'm a superhero (Uh)
When God turned the heat up on me, he said "You De Niro"
Let's play it smart, 'cause we ain't playin' checkers, this is chess, play your pawns
Sit back like a king, when they move, make your mark
And never ever let your competition take your heart (Take your heart)
Say I believe in myself
When everybody stop believin', never leave on yourself
They had my back against the wall, I had to lean on myself
Almost made me put my dreams on the shelf, I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')
Laws of attraction, you just think I'm rappin'
I'm just puttin' out the energy so I can grab it
Everything that's in my memory that I imagined
It's finally here, hundred million in a year
I still believe, still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down
Fallen ones, (Fallen ones) rest in peace (R.I.P.)
As I lay (As I lay) me down to sleep (Down to sleep)
Please, God, watch over me
You know ima talk my shit
Cause I can walk my shit
Since my boy died, the 4-5 is what I'm walking with
5 bullets we talking quick
Every track I get on I burn it down I'm an arsonist
And my flow is the awesomest
You can tell if I'm there when them L's in the air
That junk is like a skunk with the tail in the air
That stank, yeah that gank got my eyes to the back
Like six ounces, 4 xans made me nod to my lap
Stuck in a puzzle, no pieces to map
This shit is really way deeper than that
This shit get deeper than rap
Nigga I'm hungry you can hear the way I speak in my track
If I can't school you then I'm leaving you back
Like thick bitches with the weave to the back
I tell you one time only we gon' leave it at that
Because I live in the place of the highest murder rates
If your eyes on me, then my eyes on you
Take your eyes off me before my guys on you
I will cock homie and put some shots on you
I swear to God homie, you need your God with you
Cause if my squad with me, they gon' ride on you
You can't survive homie, he ain't alive he through
Telling y'all, hammer gon' bang you like a nail through the wall
My whole life niggas blood then I fall
I'm not Jada so I don't ask why
I'm on some shit like a fly
For all my niggas that died
The way we was living the tradition Ima keep it alive..
(Check.. Check, Listen)
I'm ambitious and hungry
These damn bitches is on me
For grands, we'll hit ya homie
With 20 up in his 40
Cancel a nigga for me
They grimy, thirsty, and starving
Watching over my target
Waiting up for this dude
The chopper under my armpit
Waiting for him to move
It's Meek Milly, Bloodhound nigga holla back
I said Meek Mill terrible, Flow unbearable

For all you lil' ratting motherfuckers better hear me out
I bring them cannons out
Cause I ain't tryna fight, I got a pound that sound like a quarter stick of dynamite
I'm in the kitchen with a pitcher of that china white
Tryna whip it, hit it harder than a Tyson right
Back to the basement with it, niggas basic with it
I fuck hoes, y'all chase them bitches
It's a difference with me, ain't no bitchin with me
Cause I just copped the pound with the laser with it
To erase a nigga, if he jump outta pocket, I grab it, jump out and cock it, and make him come out his pockets
We smoke and drink liquor for all the real niggas that we lost out here, man it's hard out here
I make it and i'll make it till tomorrow out here
Cause time is ticking, and niggas is getting offed out here
I took the wrong turn left, cause this can't be right
No this can't be like the way I thought it was gonna be
Cause I done see a couple youngins caught it before me
What the fuck is going on, but we can get it on
Cause we ridin' everyday on the top just selling ye
Until I'm gone, Ima hustle from the muscle, cause I learned only niggas that survive is the strong
Niggas come on, can't complain now it's the life we chose
Only life we know...
You can take a look in my eyes and see inside, its a devil in me
He told me lay a nigga down if he ever tempt me
So if I die it's my time nigga evidently
All I talk about is money
I got a a bad bitch in my Chevy

Oh man I wish I knew, I wish I knew it then
But I don't let it stop me you know I'll be back again
All the mistakes I've made, trouble that I've been in
I wish you knew me back when I was young
You could see me, and just how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Please, oh yeah believe me
Up to third grade it was all As, fourth and fifth grade was the hard days
Them was the wish I had a car days, 'cause all the stewards that was trapping they was all payed
Cops catch us wouldn't say a word like our jaw broke
Picture me back then, look at me right now
Preforming in front of twenty thousand on the mic now
I caught a couple cases, I had to pipe down
Was living in the dark I'm in the light now
You grind hard, then you shine harder
I'm going hard like my last name Carter, Dwayne, Sean, and Vin
Who'll play my life if I be born again
Oh man I wish I knew, I wish I knew it then
It shaped me into the person you see standin' here
I wish you knew me back when I was young
You could see me, and just how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Yeah, don't have to listen to me, you don't have to believe a single word I say
No, that's what my mother told me, still I went out and learned everything the hard way
And I've been crying, no no, I've been crying, no no
Oh yeah, she told me to grow up, I grew up and stood up now each day I move up again
Oh man I wish I knew, I wish I knew it then
I wish you knew me back when I was young
You could see me, and just how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Please, oh yeah believe me
Without a dollar to my name, I wasn't thinking rap
I say change for the better, I'm never thinking back
I should be a power forward
Shitting so much I think my toilet outta order
Take 'em out the box they like a fish up out the water
But me, I'ma survive, put that on my Ma swear to God
How you gonna win when you never try
I can see my future like I'm living in a mirage
Everyday I'm living life like I could never die
Old clothes in my closet, new whips in my garage
New watch on my wrist saying this is my time
So don't judge me, just love me
Their is nothing above me
My future so pretty, say God don't like ugly
Oh man I wish I knew, I wish I knew it then
But I don't let it stop me you know I'll be back again
All the mistakes I've made, trouble that I've been in
It shaped me into the person you see standin' here
I wish you knew me back when I was young
You could see me, and just how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Please, oh yeah believe me
Big bank take little bank
Drop a in the fish tank
Got the sharks on lean
Big bank take little bank
Drop a in the fish tank
Got the sharks on lean
Fish scale for my whole team
Watch that gonna pull up watch the pogo
Cake my birthday blow them
Candles baby please don't blow my
It's a band aid on your forehead I got people on my
On my pockets said release me to the sky
This is big bank talk make frequent as it is
Swear that money like the chili double hot
Dog tater chip bag
No sir, no shoes, no swag
I'll get cash, put that title by my name
Hottest lighters I'ma fire plus they gotta aim
I just left the title game
Don't they drove it trying to block me
Big bank take little bank
Drop a in the fish tank
Got the sharks on lean
I say at the Benjamins, pretty swimming in
And they ain't talking money
It's just my women friend
Pull up in the so sexy when the engine rim
It goes wrum, wrum, screw that
Cost like 7 birds
Cruise me down my swimming in that money
She in love with money

You ever watch a dream manifest? (You ever watch a dream manifest? ...)
It's nothing like it (It's nothing like it, It's nothing like it, It's nothing like it)
DC2
If you ain’t got a dream, you ain’t got nothing
A lot of niggas changed on me when I got money
Said it came with the game, and this what I wanted
So I’ma hustle like the first time I got fronted
For the love of the green and the love of the team
Put together a circle that couldn’t come in between
No they don’t want me to leave
But I gotta go and get it though
Time is money and I’m on a mission though
Cops run in my sister crib, I swear I gotta find a way
Tryna touch a million dollars and I’m like a dime away
Never ask a nigga for a handout, I would grind away
Write my little raps, smoke my little weed
Sold a little crack just to fund my little needs
I was sixteen getting on my little knees
Asking the lord please help me get a little cheese
It was hard out (Hard out), same time it was yard out
In the jungle where niggas will rip your heart out
Cold summers where niggas’ll probably starve out
Wanna be a kingpin from watching niggas ball out
Could you blame us, they was tryna chain us
But we was tryna fix the roof leak when it was raining
We was tryna keep the house warm when winter came in
But they rather detain us, locked us in cells with strangers to raise us
Animals go in cages
That’s what the slave masters told the workers when they slaved us (They slaved us...)
Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen
R.O.C. man told us “Sun don’t shine”
You know if his daddy hustling then his son gon’ grind
His father was locked up, now his son doing time
Two felonies on his record, he got one more time
Get an app, picture that, he don’t want no job
Lost hope, some niggas don’t even want no God
They just want a little money just to come through fly
‘Cause nobody never listens to the broke nigga
‘Cause when you broke, you considered as a joke nigga
If you a joke, you considered as a ho nigga
And no nigga wanna live life living poor nigga
Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting for this day since I was sixteen
Selling white girl, I’m talking Christine
Young boy with dreams of touching that big screen (Big screen)
Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen
It's big business, big bills, and big choppers
Cherry red Challenger looking like a lobster
All black D's on it hoes holler
Sliding through your area why is they comparing us
I'm serious, number on my check look like a serial
And I still got the block jumping Shawn Marion
I see a hater disrespect me then I'm airing them
We count money fuck bitches go super hard
Laid back Maybach looking like a superstar
Thirty in my clip it got me feeling like a shooting guard
Two fourties give a nigga eighty like Shockey
Pull up in the hood four door Maserati
Jewels on flashy like a paparazzi copy
Watch me, Philadel Flyer no hockey
Tell your chick to google me she can dot com
She ain't got to chase me just tell her Myspace me
And maybe she can find me so I can get behind it
Got the goons on deck they ride hard like Kawasaki
Swag so sick my money is the medicine
Stunting on you rookie ass niggas like a veteran
Still do my thing while I'm watching for the letter man
Had to kick the door down them pussies wouldn't let me in
I here now I said I'm here now
Had to kick the door down them pussies wouldn't let me in
Meek Milly nigga what what
I'm getting money like a mother fucker
Windows darker than the bitch but I can see
I got everything you got nothing that's why your bitch be all over me
I know why you mad, nigga, yeah
I know why you mad, nigga
Jahlil Beats, holla at me!
My wrist like "blaow"
You niggas sounding so old, I'm looking like now
'Cuz I'm young and I get it
Biggest P on my fitted
My money come with them bitches
My bank account full of commas, and my pockets be full of hundreds
Bounce with me, smoke an ounce with me
That nigga sellin' bricks? Tell him bring a house with it
My nigga like a wide receiver, run a route with it
He show you how to get it in and move it out with it
I say, all my niggas talk bricks
My dawgs don't rap
Riding around with that Mac, whoa
I'm gettin' money, I'm fucking hoes
I got a hoe that be on that fucking pole
And she be on that fuckin' pole
And that mean that she fuckin' [?]
I like bitches and money, I like money and bitches
Yeah she famous, we fuckin, but it ain't none of yo business
All these niggas be hatin', I don't fuck with them niggas
I let them niggas keep hating, I keep on fucking they bitches, wassup
I say bitch shake that ass, gone shake them titties

Could you knock that hoe? Could you blame that bitch?
'Cause you wanna roll with a real nigga like me
Then go and suck that dick like hoe to a fiend
Got YSL on my clothes and blood drip on my sneakers
Nigga, you hating on me, she chose
And I ain't fuck your girl, she role
My stick shift, she drove did everything that she 'pose

Got the top back, on a drop back, I'm back

I been workin' all day, hmmm 'til the sun go down
Back hurt, feet hurt, but I still got to work
Who gonna save me? Hmmm, break every chain, hmmm
Take me away from this place and leave me away
Runnin' like I know they comin' for me
I'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Fear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free
If they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Kill 'em all, that's the minimal, only way to fend 'em off
Leave 'em sittin' at death's door, proper way to send 'em off
They'll just beat me 'til the sin is off or my skin is off
Some tried to run, they got tracked down, now our limit's off
I'm just tryna find the North, let the stars design the course
Hope the mud can hide my scent, pray the night can slow they horse
Got me shackled up in chains, even made me change my name
But they couldn't trap my mind, this cry for freedom ain't in vain
See they taught us half the story, didn't know we came from glory
Years ago we was kings before the boats came and lured me
Woo, gotta keep runnin', gotta keep runnin'
Yah, cause they keep gunnin', and they keep comin'
I'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Fear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free
If they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Slaves, on the North side of Philly
And go spend that money they made on designer
We shoot at our brothers but run from the coppas
We go get a lawyer, a liar, that's descent
To meet with the District Attorney agreement
If we finna take it, I'm finna go straight for the win
(Winnin', winnin', winnin')
We started as slaves, we came up from nothin'
Again and again, 'gain and again, huh
Little babies that was never loved
So they run into the corner store
Quarter water only time they get a hug
Get some coca, only time they get some work
Say that it be poppin' on the first
'Til they popped him, now he ridin' in a hearse
People really, really outta work
Kids starving somethin gotta work
Preacher even trappin' out the church
Put them shackles on my arm and leg
All them days made my body hurt
So we turn to prayer, hoping God will work
Runnin' like I know they comin' for me
I'm 'bout to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Fear no evil, 'bout to set my people all free
If they crucify me, that's just what it's gon' be
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now
Black Moses, Moses, woah now

You already know who you are
You ain't trying to impress nobody
Who you got to impress?
You done came through the ranks
You've been tested, you know what I mean?
And you stood up
That mean you've been tested and you stood up
So who you got to impress?
You ain't got to impress nobody, man
Be who you are, you know what I mean?
You should be yourself because I'm saying if you do shit, man, for other people, then you faking it
I don't need you to be no motherfucking gangster for me
I need you to be a man
I got God watchin' over me from courtside
Ballin' like I'm Jordan 'cause I'm blessed up
And niggas want me gone, but I'm still alive
Wake up every morning feelin' blessed up
Pull up in that holy Ghost 'cause I'm blessed up
I'ma do the most 'cause I'm blessed up
Had to scoop my niggas out the hood
It's outstandin' that I'm still standin'
Macs get brandished when beef get sandwiched, blat, blat
Do it for my niggas that's scammin'
On the corner with it runnin' that tan ish
Duckin' the Ds, cut through the alley, scuffin' your trees
Tossin' the profit and fuck up your re
Start from a dollar, couple of Gs
It's time to kill 'em, nigga
I got an eight flipped over and I'm dealin', nigga
Five hundred for the piece how I'm feelin', nigga
That's why I ain't really feelin' niggas
And if them hoes fuck with rats I ain't sayin' nothin' to them bitches
I guess I ain't really for them bitches
I got God watchin' over me from courtside
Ballin' like I'm Jordan 'cause I'm blessed up
And niggas want me gone but I'm still alive
Wake up every morning feelin' blessed up
Pull up in that holy Ghost 'cause I'm blessed up
Had to scoop my niggas out the hood
Now we all eatin' good like we should 'cause we blessed up
Blessings, you niggas stressin'
Mac on the dresser when I'm dressin' and never pressure
Crab in the barrel, watch the bucket, don't let 'em catch you
Cause if they pull you back to the bottom, know you gon' suffer, fuck 'em
Therefore, I'ma hustle
New Wraith on Forgis
Course that's from the muscle
Course I got a bubble, new Porshce red like a devil
Go skrt skrt through the lane on you
Niggas broke and you faker than that chain on you
I told Tak when he see you, go insane on you
Can't D me, call it man, I clear the lane on you
You get some money, watch how all these niggas change on you
That's why I changed on 'em, I don't feel a thing for 'em
Nigga, I'm blessed
I got God watchin' over me from courtside
And niggas want me gone but I'm still alive
Wake up every morning feelin' blessed up
Had to scoop my niggas out the hood
Now we all eatin' good like we should 'cause we blessed up
I put on my niggas, what else Imma do
Give a fuck bout this money bought momma a crib my sister one too
My grandmama next, she don't want to move
I throw her some racks before I go and buy one of these bitches some shoes
This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
When the night is cold and lonely
(This is a Dollar Bill beat)
Was it the money that made me a savage?
Poppin' them Percs and I made it a habit
That was exciting to me, I'm so excited to be
Started with nothin', we had to inspire to be
Niggas ain't flyer than me, I'm getting to it
Feel like the man, I got the plan
I call the shooters, they hop out the van
Play with the squad, get popped like a Xan
I'm goin' crazy on niggas, too wavy for niggas
Do magic like alakazam
Then straight to the jeweler, I'm bustin a Rollie
I got the plug, he send 'em OT
Even old niggas, they call me OG
We was on it when it weren't 'round
All of sudden niggas wanna come around
This is my blues
Do me one favor, take a few steps back
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
And then look at yourself
This is the blues I'm playing
Congratulations, it's the motherfuckin' Chasers
Yes, it's a fine old thing
You feel me? We on it
When the night is cold and lonely
And show 'em some love
You did me a favor, I knew you was sheisty
I knew you would show who you was
It's only a matter of time before niggas get lined
And hit with them slugs
Get found in a pool of your blood, yeah, nigga
'Member they told me that we would fail
'Member they said we would see a cell
Down with that semi like Cam Newton
I'm in the field like the NFL
Niggas is sick' and I wish em well
I made a wish in a wishing well
I put a brick in a wishing well
Been through some shit and I'm sick of jail
No disease but I'm sick of cells
Sick and tired of sending niggas mail
Calling niggas just to get a bail
Never coming homeand minute on the phone
Sick and tired of seeing niggas fail
Sick and tired of seeing niggas lose
Sinning like we tryna get to hell
This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
Yes, it's a final thing
When the night is cold and lonely
Make sure you know what you're dealing with now
I'm double digits

I fell in love with the streets, yeah I was 16 (youngin)
Grinding like Clipse, tryna get cream (let’s get it)
A little nigga in the field, was doing big things
Big hammers, big work, and had a big team
It was popping round the time we had it in green
Yeah we was dirty, narcs tryna sweep the strip clean
Plus we had that white girl, you know, that Christine
Aculera, that should dare her, make a rich fiend
Go broke tryna fix dreams
Watching niggas cook the coke it looked like whipped cream
And I was tryna get cake (I was hungry)
My old head would tell me just wait
But I was crooked, tryna get straight
The hundreds with the big face
The money made me feel great
Talking the frosted ones
My heart was so cold had to defrost my lungs
Getting high, was paranoid and going hard with guns
Ready to squeeze on any nigga with ease
Nightmares of being murdered I believed
How the judge gon blame me
Label me a felon ‘fore you label me as telling
Upstate jail and tuna soup and getting melon
Tell em, was raining yesterday but now it’s hailing
It’s death up in the air, you can smell it
Man they got the reaper round the corner tryna catch a body
The hungry youngins up the street they tryna catch somebody
Slipping, they got their smith and they gon stretch some bodies
If they don’t get paid, somebody gon get sprayed
And one love to my niggas in the twist cage
No commissary chow without the lid tray
Guard spit in it, but you can feel your rib cage
Touch it so you’re like fuck I got to live today
You niggas fucking with them hoes, I’m fucking with them Benjis
I be cutting up them O’s, fucking with that stove
That shit you made last week, I fucked it up on clothes
Spend half of that on Prada and the other half on dros
I said nigga do you, Imma do me
That haze it got him in the zone like a 23
Them niggas need a smoke, we got that oohwee
Purp by the pound, ounces of the sour D
We 32’d the Glizzy’s, compact to max
Sliding through they hood, tinted down, back to back
Skis, dickies, and hoodies show where they trapping at
Murder murder graveyard, funeral service for em
We collect bosses, they flunkies, whoever working for em
Yeah, Meek motherfucking Milly
You niggas know what it is
BH we straight to the motherfucking day that I die nigga
Free my nigga lil
GT franchise we got the game on motherfucking lock
Boss
It's so hard for me to sit back here, in this studio
Looking at a guy out here, hollering my name
When last year I spent more money on spilt liquor
In bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made
You're talking to the Rolex wearing
Diamond ring wearing, kiss stealing, woo!
Wheeling dealing, limousine riding, jet flying son of a gun
And I'ma have a hard time, holding these alligators back
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)

Anybody wanna act loco?
Who you with? Numerous shots from the .44
Young nigga in the low low
Jumpin' out the thing with a little bad bitch like YOLO
.44 on my hip line, this time ain't no joke
In the hood where there ain't no hope
Now everybody ridin' dirty like it ain't no soap
Everybody get to rappin' when there ain't no coke
Where the money nigga? Cop 44 a bird where I live at
Probably buy the whole load if you get it back
I like fast cars, fast broads and my last car was like a NASCAR
It go vroom, vroom, then skrr, skrr 'fore I blast off
She go up and down like NASA, bike life on your bitch nigga
Pop a wheelie all in that pussy, she switchin' gears on this dick nigga
Still young, reckless, and rich nigga, yellow diamonds like piss nigga
Stones they glistening nigga, ya'll suckas don't do it like this nigga
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)

You ain't seen a dead body, I done held my dope thang
To seen the niggas who shot 'em in they own blood
Had to wipe momma's tears, she dreamin' I'm dead
My niggas gettin' bread, my niggas beat the Feds
Every night I send a photo, my bad
You ain't bout that life, that life, keep 100 shots in that pipe
200 on my dash, thousand grams of that white
Sky Dweller my watch, two kilos my Cuban
Courtside like Mark Cuban, you getting money? Then prove it nigga
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)

90PX, working all night no breaks or a recess
Vroom vroom yeah I know my car sound like a T-Rex
Bitch, I'm 23 years old and I ain't riding in a Prius
My cousin finished school can't believe he graduated
Threw him 20,000 dollars told his ass congratulations

And to live like this you motherfuckers gotta pay
So let that shit burn! Let that shit burn
I'ma let that shit burn, let that shit burn (Burn, gasoline!)
The roof on fire, I'm only gettin' higher

The roof on fire, I'm only gettin' higher

Uh, go hard for that paper so I can get what I want
Stood in the back, I couldn't fit in the front
Now I pull in the back, my whip sit in the front
Caught with the bastards, early gymnastics
I never had a master but I done mastered
The art of getting money in a timely fashion
You know we still...remain real nigga, you know, niggas be playin'
You gotta see 'em, you gotta see me man
When you see me you keep the same energy that you had
You know what I'm saying?
You have to see us. You see what I'm saying?
And it could have got worse but, you know, these niggas be pussies
Shoot, just keep the same energy
Whenever you say something about any Dreamchaser, nigga, just keep the same energy when you see us and man
Anybody, we ain't got no picks over here. Dreams worth more than money
Uh, gimme some levels, turn it up
Uh, they sayin' that I talk too much money
But maybe cause I saw too much money
I can't chase around no broads with no regard to touch money
So if it ain't about no paper, get them all the fuck from me
Young dummies, uh, realest, richest nigga in my town
Yeah, if you ain't come with your pistol then get from 'round here
Cause I'm the ref. with the whistle, you out of bounds here
And this time on my Sky-dweller say “The crowns near"
Be tryna broker and bargain something that's not there
I'm barely sleeping, having million dollar nightmares
I'm right c'here, finna kill 'em, kill 'em all, they shi-shi-shivering
On the days end, that I stayed in, First year I came in, Pop stars got came in
Hold up, hold up, I don't know I said first year I came in, they got came in
Basic bitches can't sit with us
And none of these niggas ain't really rich as us
We swore that that money’ll never get to us
We swore that these bitches'll never get to us
And loyalty go to the grave for this shit
All my niggas pay for this shit
Cause we already rich and you know I'm the shit
Got fifty niggas with me, they got Rollies on they wrist
Uh, I want everything my niggas want except for the hoes they fuckin'
Who that right there? Turn around they fuss if [?] truckin'
It don't matter, you know how we rockin', we thuggin'
Look at my man's wrist there, you see it's bright
21st and Berks, this the whole set
My nigga Dean, he was catchin' wreck
Bending corners on niggas, 50 in the Tec
(laughing) I can’t...I need like a basic beat
Locin’ low and tosin’ pussy you was not there
Shackled to our ankles, it was like a nightmare
You ever wash out your drawers the same water you shit
Doing your push-ups right on the floor where you piss
You gotta rumble with ‘em nighttime down to the mornin’ and shit
(laughing) they can’t get no more of that
I seen a nigga get murdered for a half a bird
Headshot, cat licked his brains off the curb
To ball in ‘em sixes on them like, Julius served
And I ain’t gotta rock a vest ‘cause really I’m good
And I should shout out my connects, like really I should
Like Death Row and 9’5, Meek Milly I Suge
But I’m cocky as Pac, ice hockey the watch
Green Mercedes, brown butter be broccoli the drop
‘Cause them winters was cold, the beef from broccoli was hot
We was sellin’ them O’s, still getting watch from the cops
Praying that Papi don’t grow up to be just like us
Praying them people don’t judge us and try to life us
I did it for all my niggas, we ballin’ no they don’t like us
And they wanna kill us, if they could one of the realest
But they can’t find us on a wood watching the Clippers like a Kingpin
No hatin’ man we wanna see the whole Philly win
Ya'm sayin? Like we wanna see when we out of town
A bunch of niggas from Philly holdin’ it down too man
What part of Philly you from man? Put on it for the whole city man, everybody
Turn up, Put down the guns and pick up some money
(I’mma keep mines and keep the money, yeah you know what I mean)
(I ain’t mad at nothin’ tho)
Man, you ready?
Feeled like I committed perjury
‘Cause this time they talkin’ ‘bout in here, it ain’t me
And next time I bring my son to court so he can see
How they wanna murder his Daddy, I murder the Caddy
Should I make a left or right,? ‘Cause nothing was never right
We’s infatuated with bustin’ guns and sellin’ white
I remember Snupe’s momma called me from the scene
No life in his body, blood on his jeans
Couldn’t believe it, one of the youngest in my regime
Got murdered and I’m feelin’ like it’s ‘cause of me
Or the name that I brought to him?
Man a nigga put a fling, put a torch to ‘em
And I put that on my son, I tried to talk to ‘em
And tell ‘em stay away from murder
R.I.P to my Lil nigga Snupe
Yeah that’s how we rockin’, we rockin’ our Lil Snupe for life nigga
He was only 18, only one that was a coupe
If you get a job they laugh at you, kill something they salute
That’s the only shit they see, that’s the only shit they do murder
Young mothers teaching daughters how to bust it open
Babies having babies and them babies having babies man
This shit is lookin’ crazy even birthday was a maybe
Mommy playing daddy role, ‘cause he behind a fence
And she told them he in school ‘cause them kids they in suspense
Man these clouds look grey from this view behind the tent
Good girls that selling pussy, she was due behind the rent
And these kids need shelter, don’t nobody help her
And who am I to judge her, tears of a single mother
And the only thing that scare her, ain’t nobody hear her
So them tears turn black when the touch the mascara
Why I treat my last meal like I treat my last prayer
Very thankful, ‘cause I done had shackles on my ankles
Shackles on my wrist too, I swear that shit was painful
The reflection of your eyes through that picture
I could paint you, like Basquiat, feel a soul from the fascia
Some recite the songs, the religious say the fire hot
And I don’t want to go to hell, but it’s hell on Earth
If I can't pay God with this money, then tell me what it’s worth
I say, I say, Said she want a boss just to sweep her off her feet
Hit her with the D and I can’t keep her off the meat
We be creepin’ all in weekends, I’m talkin’ freakin’ all in weeks
‘Cause loyalty is royalty, hoes ain’t loyal
You are what you are and I had love for you
Heard you with a baller, hopin’ he enjoy you
‘Cause you was like a bill with a drill to my pocket
All these hundred dollar bills in my pocket
She could give you gottens and she gon’ give you problems
When she don’t even try to, blame it on your momma, bitch
Or blame it on jail, ‘cause you thought you was poppin'
With your little followers (ha)
She thought she was poppin’ with her little bit of followers, ha
What I do? Tell her break ‘em, And if a nigga fuck my bitch for free
What I do? Let ‘em take her (You can have that bitch)
‘Cause I got so much money, What I do? I could build ‘em, I could make ‘em
Tummy tucks and ass shots, what we doin’? Flying bitches to Jamaica
Dreamchaser, nigga!
Talk to ‘em!
Real niggas back in style man, Guns and butter man, D.C
Uh, Uh, It’s Osama, Twin Llama, from the D.C. camp
Heard you like to run your mouth, you the people’s champ?
All that shit gon’ get your t-shirt damp
A tag on your toe, pussy nigga that’s the D.C. stamp
(With the ladder in the stashbox) (oh)

Yeah, uh
All the young'uns in my hood popping percs now
Gettin' high to get by, it's gettin' worse now
You gotta tell 'em put them guns and them percs down
Them new jails got ten yards in 'em and that's your first down, uh
And I ain't come here to preach
Youngin' gotta quarter ounce, he tryna turn into Meech
Ain't had no daddy, he's had to learn from the streets
I used to be a honor roll student, damn
Then I turned to a beast
The first time I seen a nigga get some blood on his sneaks
He had on Air Max 93s but was slumped in the street
His mama cryin', that did somethin' to me, oh Lord
I used to sell Reggie, damn how' I get to the Forbes?
Ain't quittin' no more, like give me some more
We wearing Old Navy, it felt like Christian Dior
Was dead broke but rich in soul, was we really that poor?
Was we really that dumb? 'Cause we carry a gun
I'm speakin' to you as a prophet as rare as they come, uh
Gunshots sound like music hangin' out the Buick
Why you wanna be a shooter?
Mama told me not to do it but I did it
Now I'm locked up in a prison
Callin' mama like "I shouldn't have did it"
Watch my dream shatter in an instant
I'm on a visit posin' for the picture
Like I'm going for my prom or somethin'
Ridin' for these niggas like that shit ain't hurt my mom or somethin'
Only one gon' get me commissary or even buy me somethin'
When it all fall down
I can't call y'all now
That won't get me home
Shit we was kids used to play on the step
A couple years later we flirtin' with the angel of death
I was 11 years old, I got my hands on the TEC
When I first touched it that shit gave me a rush
My homie's dying I'm like "Maybe we next"
That just made me a threat
Knowin' the niggas smoke my daddy it just made me upset
Made me a man shit I was five when God gave me my test
I know a young'un that got murked ain't get to drive no Wraith
But he in the hearse on the way to church, I know his mom gon' faint
When she smell like embalment fluid, cologne all on her baby
How could you blame me? When I'm tryna stay alive and just survive and beat them odds when niggas die by twenty-five
When I stop fearin' for my life, when I decide to change my mind And stop totin'
Tryna smoke the pain away, they lock us up for smoking
Victim to the system like a rain drop in the ocean
They closin' all the schools and all the prisons gettin' open
Yeah
See comin' from where I come from
We had to beat the streets
Beat the system, beat racism, beat poverty
And now we made it through all that we at the championship

We ain't swingin' no flag, nigga
We ain't need no pass, nigga
Glock 40 with a 30 clip and a laser on it, play tag with us
Everybody wanna talk bricks
'Til them feds swoop in and grab niggas
Dream Chasers got into somethin'
We don't ever blink 'cause we trash niggas
Deen Buck still in the cut and the state fittin' to let Ernie out
I ain't even gotta say nothin'
'Bout that other homie that you heard about
'Cause if he heard about that you run your mouth
He come to your house and start swervin' out
Catch me N-Y-C, out Shadyville, I'm in the tank
Only time it's Manhattan when I'm in the booth or I'm in the bank
Summertime in La Marina with Dominicans goin' in the paint
Pullin' up, screamin', "Eh, Dimelo'?"
Catch you in Brooklyn, get pita-rolled, pussy!
You fuck around get smoked
Nigga, you fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
(Yeah! Ayy, Meek, whattup? Bang! Oh, man in Chiraq)
Niggas say me and Sosa beefin'
But we both eatin', but only one keepin'
Told Law he take 15 years
Can't tweet Teyana, corporate nigga lookin'
So what I’m on I gotta keep it secret
That face no Stevie no Mimi, I promise Teyana that I won't leak it
Gripped the 30, just cashed out
If you caught strippin' then you assed out
I'm the same nigga my city asked about
Four birds in the trap like four wings at Harold’s
With fries covered in mild sauce
Everytime a nigga rap beef, get clapped up in a couple weeks
Location on, we can go and meet
Pop a wheelie in N-Y-C, I got the 30 on with my nigga Flee
Heard Tyga sneak dissin' on me, tell them thot bitches I'm not right
Tyga only got one name, but that nigga ain't got one stripe
He backpack, so easy to get the nigga shit snatched
In Chiraq, don't come here
You ain't from here? Don't come here
'Cause shorty snipin', bag on him if he don't like this
30 punch like Tyson
Back to the rap flow, hot shit
Fuck I gotta rap for, got bricks
Every city I go, got sticks
Pockets Wells Fargo, no bricks
Say I'm on top now, no shit
You can never say I wife shit
I don't even like shit, I just pipe shit, one night shit
L.A. with killas and thuggers
New York SlowBucks, them my brothers
A-T-L with Migos and Young Thugger
We gon' shoot shit up in public
And they gotta urge to take
Chiraq, look at the murder rate
You wear red bottoms and Phillip Lim
Everybody tryna get a hold of him
Bad bitches they be in Benz
I knock ‘em down like bowling pins
Real nigga on 4nem
Young Jefe, the new Soulja Slim
Hangin’ out the tank with Slow and them
Come take a trip to D.C.
I’m the big dog, I’m ringin’ off
Like Mambo Sauce on a 3 piece
“Glizzy, why you ain’t D.C.?"
Who said I ain’t D.C.?
Fuck ya bitch to my CD
She let me record her like Mimi
A nigga playin’, it’s lights out
Ooh, shine got me iced out
Can't wait 'til it get nice out
Tell Chino bring the bikes out
Got 50 guns in my trap house
You better off fuckin’ with the White House
I’m the realest youngin' in the fuckin’ world
I got plenty money, I got plenty girls
And they all wanna go for a fuckin’ swirl
Had her come to us with the marble pearls
357, that bitch just twirl
Make him catch our shit like Fitzgerald
You fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
Woo! It’s hot outside man
Meek Millys coming daddy
Hundred for the walkthrough, I'm not who you talk to
Drive by and wet you up, nigga thats a carpool
Spitting all this hot shit, every single bar cool
Diamonds in the rollie face, animated cartoon
Got me on my nappy braids before the Maybach clique
Riding in the wheels of fortune, Pat Sajak shit
And all I rock is Balmain like I made that shit
I’ve been, front row fashion week looking like I'm in the show
Sitting in the foreign, leather softer than a dinner roll
Make a movie on your bitch, tell her friend to get a role
You thought she was innocent, we laughing like she been a ho
Jumpin' out them Benzos, meet yo bitch in the friend zone
She told you I was friendzoned, what? I'm in the endzone
Touchdown with a 2 point conversion, give her that dick long
She busting like the clip long, Uber to send your bitch home nigga
I got a fever bitch
Hot outside, I got a fever bitch
Feeling sick, I got a fever bitch
In these Philly streets situations is
Police ain’t respecting the youth and
The youth ain't respecting the truth and
The Glock 9 is on me in the booth and
All I talk is that real shit the truth and
The money turned your bitch into a gold digger
The money got me feeling like the old Jigga
And Jigga even told me you a cold nigga
And I told niggas that I would expose niggas
Went to buy a pair of sneaks, landed at the Royce dealer
You can ask your baby momma, I’m flyer than her baby dad
Looking at my neck, what that cost? Hundred-eighty cash
We was selling rock before Kareem Biggs, Damon Dash
Oh you think you fly with your lil' Dream Chasin’ ass?
We don’t chase bitches, we chase money and that D'ussé
Riding in a drop head, Phantom with the toupee
And if you’re just hearing this, then it’s probably too late
I got a fever bitch
Feeling sick, I got a fever bitch
In these Philly streets situations is
The youth ain't respecting the truth and
The Glock 9 on me in the booth and
All I talk is that real shit the truth and
Meek Milly, Mack Milly
Get smacked silly, come to Philly
Come see it live in direct
Stop playin' nigga
It's DC, Double MG
Boy I swear to god I make her fuck the whole clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
Sittin' in the back while she sucking on my dick
Boy I got a hundred cash right here on my wrist
Started from the bottom now a nigga getting rich
I ain’t lookin at your bitchass
I’m looking at your bitch’s ass
I fuck a famous ho and put that dick up in her rich ass
And everytime I’m rollin, it’s 200 hundred on the [?]
She tellin' all her homies now, them bitches actin' curious
And when the cops ask 'em, they tell 'em like Siri did
Get it, iPhone, face time
Last night I had your bitch we had a great time
My flow so crazy, check the way I ride the base loud
Hold up nigga I go in, these niggas ain’t got no win
Baddest bitches I be with they lookin like they modelin'
Perks and patron got me stoned like a goblin
Mad rappers making diss records I’m like try again
Please nigga you should take a knee nigga
Like it’s september, thanking my daddy I’m the next Simba
Meek Milly, bitch
I ain’t lookin' at you bitches, cause I feel none of you bitches
I ain’t checkin' for you niggas, I ain’t worried 'bout you niggas
And my shit be kinda major, like I’m balling for the figures
Got 2 chains around my neck, you could see I do it different
She so bad but she go so ho, shit got real when I got that ball
Too 3d, but you can’t see me
The shit goes swish, and you know I did it for the win
And yeah I killed this check but fuck that shit I’ma do it again
Do it again just to quench they thirst
If you dive in put your face in first
And when I spit that shit they like I turn that pure [?]
And then they see that body, see that ass, that shit ridiculous
If you want the beef first you gotta get through my fucking crew
That’s to y’all lame nasty see
Name one chick who could fuck with me
Hold up, oh wait I say, name on chick who fucking with me
If you talking shit, just be careful what come out your mouth
Aroma something erotic, make your boyfriend pay to smell it out
Or taste it, he put his face in
He like we fuck your government that shit amazing
Yeah I’m talking Lee, Lil' Chino and Lil' Snup-e
Murder on every track, preferred Jahlil B
I’m talking bout Rozay too, we reppin with MMG
Cruising through south beach, in a California ferarri
Shine brighter than california, my jewelry it’s extra gaudy
Peep the way I maneuver, she says I’m smooth as a barbie
Man I’m living life, I might do that tonight
Met them bottles of rose, the waitress put 'em on ice
Sparkles all in my section man I could give you a light
We blowin money fast like we never seen paper
Now I got these new relatives, and everybody callin'
All of a sudden this shit started James Harden
I tell em talk about some money but they ain't talking
But I’ma go and get it 'till they put me in the coffin
It’s funny now that they callin me the shit
Louie V, DC, shit man, and ain’t nobody fuckin with my clique
I never had a role model
I was loading gold hollows in my little Glock-40
And I think it was December when they swarmed me
Niggas is jealous, fuck can they tell us
With them dreams they try to sell us? Probably why I'm rebellious
To a fraud nigga, I lost niggas when I got paper
It's like more money I made, they got faker
And it's crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater
Wanna roll out on you and smoke you like top paper
Damn, what a feeling when you and your homie chilling
And you know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you
Momma said don't ever, ever let them belittle you
Last year was like a bad year
Even though I touched more paper than a cashier
Small circle, I ain't never really 'round squares
They say there's levels to this shit, you niggas downstairs
Different floors for different bulls
Different tours on different jets, my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror, Meek Milly, this your car?
Look at your arm, check out your neck, look at your charm
And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw
When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball
I step back for the three, watch it go swish and fall
We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss
They couldn't D me like Earl Boykins, I'm sticking soft
Tried to pick me off like Champ Bailey but I'm Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown, what now?
Gold AP all bust down, fuck clowns
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day, only Lord knows
When Diddy, Hova, and Baby talking, I'm listening
When I be in the jungle, the Devil be whispering
Slugs flying by me I hear them, they whistling
That was a close call
Stand up nigga so I won't fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
Seen him last week, he was my chauffeur, I was like "told y'all"
Mommy was a booster, daddy was a shooter
Looking at my homies, see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
If I don't get he gon' probably end up with a chopper
Told my momma I won't let these haters kill me
Getting high even though it might derail me
And I won't ever let these bitches see the real me, do you feel me?
Times change like the Rollie did
Now I'm killing these niggas the way that Kobe did
Ayo, it gets fucked up when your own family start calling you up
Shit, money's the root of all evil
Family start telling you "you acting different nigga"
You're goddamn right I'm acting different
But then when it comes from your brother, your sister
Your mother, your father, that shit hurts you to the core man
When they start acting like something that you ain't never motherfucking seen
You done grew up motherfucker
You got raised, you done played in the park with them
This money thing, this shit will fuck you up man
You got to watch what you ask for
You sure you want this son? You sure you want this money?
You sure you want this fame? You sure you want this power?
Yeah everybody want it, everybody need it, money motherfuckers
Get money don't stop but I ain't mad at them
Shit, but shit even bosses got feelings you know?
Don't let this money bring us down
Shit, everybody eats B, everybody eats, everybody eats
Let's go, hahahah
Uh, yeah
And them streets all night like we ain't have nowhere to live
I remember Sundays we ain't have nothing but Liv
Thirty thousand was the tab and you ain't have nothing to give
I ain't trip, I ain't trip, I pour bottles, I ain't sip
I let niggas shine bright, you still act like I ain't shit?
Let you have them little hoes, they was all on my dick
Twenty chains, eight watches, can't fit on my wrist
When I speak about them things I never said it's my shit
I said it's ours nigga and when you're ready we're gonna ball nigga
But I know just what I saw nigga
It was envious, you looked sideways and I remembered it
The reason that my heart's cold now on some December shit
Talking about the twenty-fifth, matter of fact the twenty-sixth
Maybe it's the twenty-eighth, fuck it though my money's straight
As long as Papi smiling
I'mma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot
I've seen it, I've seen it
And I was surprised man I ain't want to believe it
But yeah nigga I've seen it
My heart getting cold, and the streets getting colder
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day, only Lord knows
Woah, don't you, baby, hey
It won't matter, baby
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
It won't matter, baby
Don't you know?
Uh, make it out the hood, they say you Hollywood
How dare you niggas tell me that I got it good
Gotta check and treat these niggas like I'm Robin Hood
And I was lookin' at you niggas, all the ones I fed
Had me grindin' all them nights when you was going to bed
And if you think I owe you something, nigga gon' ahead
Treat you like I never knew you, put it on your head
And I got Papi on my line like, 'When you comin' home?'
My mama see it in my face, she know that somethin' wrong
Bodies droppin' in my city all summer long
Out on bail but I still gotta keep somethin' on
'Cause I can't let 'em take my life, you might get left you make that right
When he got left it wasn't right, but he was tryna live that life
I call up Coon to book that jet, we like three deep, we take that flight
Used to land in California to play that studio all night, we stayin' down
For the love of them millions, ain't layin' down
Left you in the hood, what you sayin' now?
And niggas wanted the smoke, you said, "Stand down," uh
Cold heart, never get cold feet when the pressure come
It was beef, I had to tell niggas, "You better come"
Sister said they gettin' over, it's like you lettin' them
Some shit I had to learn my lesson from, uh
Checkin' in, checkin' out, I just had to check you out
2012, it was 50 niggas when I'm steppin' out
Forgot the time you asked me for a check and I ain't lend it out
I ain't even know you was upset, that's what this shit about?
When you can't bring up one time you returned me for a favor
'Cause I know the signs when niggas switch sides, catch them vapors
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550
Scream, "Ride or die," I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous, you wouldn't even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550
What I'm supposed to spend a thousand nights in the studio rappin' my lights out?
They give a nigga my money, then act like he hangin' with me
I ain't never been sweet
Far as I can remember, every time I went to jail I had to stand up in that bitch by myself
See, it hurt my heart to see some of my closest friends turn their back on me about that attention needle
Or a green piece of paper with a slave master on the front of that shit
I used to hear niggas, niggas that I was feedin', I heard 'em whisperin', "Meek Mill finished"
I was like, "And damn, I was feedin' you, bro"
All I did was keep grindin'
For the love of the millions, royalty over loyalty, never get it confused
I got a homie that's doin' life—he can't offer me no money, he can't offer me nothin' but a friendship and a relationship
I talk to him seven days a week
So if you feel some type of way about my money, we goin' to the furthest extent to protect that plate that goes in front of my son on the table, nigga
While I had to sacrifice and put it all on the line
One time for my mom and sister that never changed on me, even before I had money
Ride or die, no matter what
Dreamchasers for life, you dig?
If you don't see 'em in the pictures with me, that mean they faded away
I got niggas I distanced myself from, we love each other, it's all love but everybody can't make it
Niggas wanna burn a bridge and expect you to send a yacht, huh? Where they do that at?
I'm yelling free my nigga TIP
Brought him from Atlanta to Philly, Mike Vick
Fighting charges lawyers say that they might stick
I was praying to God, man don't do me like this
The girls fucking niggas with the bricks
Now they popping me I laugh dirty bitch
Dirty money new work
Smell it on my new shirt
Lying make these suckas feel good but truth hurt
A lot of niggas do dirt, get it in return
But enough of dirt doing have you sitting with the worms
Hollow tips fucking up your head like a bowl cut
When my hommies roll up they be like hold up
I ain't with the talking tell 'em spark 'em like a blunt wrap
Rather make these suckas bow down like a blunt
Twist them like a Backwood, black laid black hood
Dicked down ski'd up
Hoes down G's up
I couldn't get no Gucci, but I could get an Oozie
Spray up your hood and hit your neighbors just for being nosy
You niggas on that dumb shit
My niggas got them birds and come and get a drumstick
I am cooked crack to the [?]
All this rapping got me shining like aluminum foil
Your niggas ain't loyal
Money, envy, and greed will destroy you
All over a dollar sign
And I'm hotter than these suckers like a thousand times
Yeah, gang
Chasers, Chasers, Chasers, Chasers, gang
Ayy

In the kitchen with the Pyrex, baking cookies (cookin' work)
Bending through that Bentley truck, they couldn't miss me
Yeah, bitch I'm talking fifty
If I stand up on my money, they can't never overlook me
White come straight from 'cross the border, you can never overcook it
I switch it to Blake Griffin, they gon' bang that shit on y'all
Told my bro to bring his hit, we gon' hang it on the wall
They've been waitin' on that ring to pull that thing and chop it off
Link with the connect and we collect them blocks (that white perico)
Running to a pussy and collect his watch

Running to a pussy and collect his watch

No need for wallets, ball that shit up in my fist
Get out the projects, that's the first one on the list (mama)
Pack up your bags, mama your lil son is shit (mama)
We impeaching niggas then we hit them with the blitz
Speaking in silence, it's okay to talk in code
It's still lil' Boobie Boys and gotta shout the zoes
We one of one therefore I tailor-made the clothes
I got the dome setted on D's and the lows
Still fly commercial but I don't do TV shows
Fucking a actress so she gotta play the role
Versace diners at a Donatella toast
Black in a 'Vetty, got IG out, watchin' post
They gave him life for living life, that boy was sauce
Who you fadin'? Pussy boy, go get a body bag
Still war ready, never run with rats
Once again, the dope boys running rap
Connect the dots, connect the dots
Link with the connect and we collect them blocks (that white perico)
When we catch him, headshot, disconnect his top, woo!
See what it is, they don't know a rock from a diamond
I'm like hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
Wait a minute, motherfucker
Tell your bitch "Fall back, nigga" (For what), we ain't got no space (No way)
And your bitch ain't bad (No), nigga, you ain't got no taste (Whoa)
And everybody want to be the king, like the deck ain't got no Ace
Half of my bitches, they richer than me
Hoes that you payin', I'm hittin' for free

I'm about to ride by hanging out the Benz
We getting money like we never heard of the feds
The black Bentley Coupe rollin' like the Batmobile
I'm about guap baby, I'm about cake
Push the button in the doors to about face
Whats poppin mami, I be gettin' money now
I'm from Brooklyn but they love me out in Houston now
Say "hi" to life, bye to my broke days
I'm about cream, I'ma, I'ma 'bout cream
About that money and about that cream (hey, hey, hey)
I'm about cream, I'ma, I'ma 'bout cream (about that)
I'm about cream, I'ma, I'ma 'bout cream
About that money and about that cream (hey, hey, hey)
I'm about cream, I'ma, I'ma 'bout cream
I'm already convicted
My whole life has been turned around
I lost every job, I lost everything, every opportunity I can get
Can't get, buy cars, can't get rent, can't get none of that
But I'm still a survivor, y'know, I'm still coming to court
Still smiling, still signing autographs, but soon I'ma go crazy!
America eats its babies, we, I'm
No matter what y'all think about me
You can't just turn me off like that
Huh! Huh! Huh!
2Pac back, 2Pac back
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better picture me rollin’
Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
Ugh! 2Pac back, I’m two Glocks strapped
Rolling down in Philly, this the new Iraq (Philly!)
I’m sipping Hennessy!
Riding on my muh'fucking enemies!
Sliding in the back, I'm screaming, "MMG!" (Maybach Music)
10 bitches and they dime so it’s Tennessee
A nigga play with my money, my shooters lifting his soul
Bitch, I’m like John Wall, 'cause I just give 'em and go
Pockets look like they pregnant because them bitches is swollen
Got a clip I can loan, all them snitches could hold 'em
Look at them motherfucking wheels! Them bitches is stolen
They screamin'
2Pac back, 2Pac back
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
Talking Death Row records, tell em have me a chair
Let it burn, I’m screaming: "Free my nigga Hearn!"
Got my Makaveli CD then I listened than I learned
Grabbed my Mac above the dresser, my OG said, "Hold it firm"
I’m dreaming spitting with Pac (Pac!) and cyphers with B.I.G (B.I.G!)
Had me scraping my wax, sleeping, my knife in the bed
They got a nigga on point like it's a price on my head
I'm going max! Got me knocking suckers and they back
In these cells, raising hell, tryna get back to the trap
But don’t never get it twisted, it’s Meek Mill, we spittin’ facts (Meek Milly!)
Plus somebody said they seen it and they mean it
So they steady screamin'
2Pac back, 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better picture me rollin’
Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
M-M-M-Maybach Music
Right Now Sound
Hitmaka!
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in your eyes, shit is dangerous
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
I really wanna be right here
I really wanna take you there (you there, oh there)
When it's nights like this
I really wanna be right here (be right here)
I really wanna take you there (you there, baby, yeah, yeah)
Uh, it was nights like this, feelin' right like this
I never really spent no time like this, huh
The second time at the crib knowin' I might not hit
You said, "What I look like?" Like my bitch, yeah
Look into your eyes, shit is dangerous
The pussy wet, I call it angel dust
I done put so many diamond chains on you, they get tangled up
I never felt like this, it's strange as fuck (that's what it's like loving you)
Got yo ex nigga calling, but he can't do much
'Cause you with the kid now, Ella Mai, boo'd up
And all you gotta do is call and watch that Wraith pull up
Under the stars since they throwin' all that shade on us
Facts, woo!
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you
Uh, you feel the vibe, uh, I'm deep inside, yeah
You fuckin' me, ooh, I let you ride, yeah
At first you curved me, I let you slide in
Yo hips so curvy, you let me slide in
Ooh, and it was over once I flipped you over
Relation goal when we come through just like Beyoncé, Hova
This that Hermes money, this ain't no Fashion Nova
You said yo ex had you depressed and I'm just glad that's over
'Cause now you rockin' with a real one
And when I hit it back to back, you make me still cum
That's facts
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous (Your eyes)
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
That's what it's like loving you
Ayy, you know you bad babe
Just give me all of that pussy, so many options (so many options)
Girl, you got me callin', all these different numbers
Why you being selfish? You know that I want you
You be leavin' work and you deserve a Birkin
Girl, you so contagious, damn that shit so dangerous
Look in yo eyes, shit is dangerous
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
You taking pictures, know your angles
Ooh, no we ain't perfect, but we damn close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what it's like loving you

MMG in the building
I get money bitch
Yeah, Philly
If they ain't talking money, I don't hear em though
If they ain't talking pussy, I don't hear them hoes
I'm a paper making, pussy getting animal
More money, more problems
So every check I get, I'm buying more choppas
So every check I get, I'm buying more choppas
Hunnid stacks, that's featherweight
It's time to get this money and the record straight
Fuck the loud ho's, I don't ever hate
On the first night, I don't ever wait
I buy her weave, and red bottoms
I be in the hood, where the lead poppin'
While you was buyin' circles we was square coppin'
Thirty six, Pyrex
Bakin Soda, I make a nine stretch
Paper towel, let it dry yes
Got em lookin' at my wrist like "Is he signed yet?"
No nigga, you a ho nigga
Rapper, you a action figure G.I Joe nigga
Middle of the streets I'm on a 4-wheela
Same night I rock the same stages as HOV nigga
Hah!
If they ain't talking money, I don't hear em though
I'm a paper making, pussy getting animal
More money, more problems
So every check I get I'm buying more choppas
So every check I get I'm buying more choppas
I say, I be off in the kitchen
Pitchin' apron and a mitten
Trying to get it back ya a nigga trying to get it
Hit it hit it straight with a [?]
Trying to burn it all down and bring it all back
Know this shit done when it drop in the pot
For the right price I can make it straight drop
Right price drop make a lot lot
I don't like mine looking like popcorn
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
Oh Lord!
Hundred in the mula got more diamonds than a jeweler
Nigga down to do ya, I ain't fucking with a curl bar
Nickle plated ruger have you in a box on Worldstar
Duck nigga, duck nigga, duck nigga
Court side Sportscenter, I can make you a believer
Everybody going broke, keep it real, you gotta fight it
Hundred kilo’s in the beemer, boy don’t make me get excited
Couple milli on the neck like I’m tryna get indicted
Got a mansion, got a yacht, bad bitch and a tiger
Real niggas, taking over televisions
Dope boys riding in a new set of Benzes
Hot boy, Young boy, still on fire
What’s a death sentence 'cause we all gotta die
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
Oh Lord!
Sittin' on them M’s, now shit is gettin' realer
Brick of diesel got my hood looking like it's Thrilla'
Just to let my niggas hold on when they rollin', it could kill 'em
And these suckas, I don’t feel 'em
I don’t even see 'em
I’m a die fly, rest in Peace Aaliyah
Half my dawgz dead, the rest of them is here
Said I did it for my dawgz, did it for my dawgz
Started with a Bonnie now I’m sittin' in a Porsche
With the shooters right behind me
Shit, you looking at a boss
Basketball leather in the Benz, Spalding
Y'all niggas talking, fuck is y'all retarded?
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
Oh Lord!
Did it for them niggas with a vision like a boss
Did it for them niggas in the kitchen with the salt
Now I’m in that white thing, 500 horses for my niggas in the coffin
But got bikes in my hand and a drop head Rolly
Staring at the ceiling when I wake up in the morning
My dawg doing life, try to see him ‘fore he hit the coffin’
Play with my paper, run up in your offices
It’s the 'o twelve Ice Cube nigga with the Raider hat
A maniac nigga, where the paper at
Highway to life, need a hundred mill exit
50 on the wrist, hundred on the necklace, Montana!
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz
Oh Lord!
Yo, watch who you drinking with
Watch who you smoking with
If I put 7 in ya face, will I open it
And I know tomorrow ain't promised but I hope it is
Love to get acquainted with you
Stay and tear the jail up
Did it for my dawgz so I had to put the bails up
Get them thangs off so I haven’t put the scales up
Treat you like a pit, get ya ears and ya tail cut
Choppas still hot, you can hold it for yourself
Versace, same buckle on the loafers and the belt
Yeah the pills is flying but the smokers is something else
The dough got 'em bringing in the broads
Obvious the flow got 'em screaming for the lord
If there’s money on ya head what you think is the reward?
I ain't do it for myself, you know who I did it for?
I did it for my dawgz
Oh Lord!
I said I'm cooler than a fan fresh like it's Easter
Heser thought that's what they all say skeezers
I just fucked her yesterday homie you can keep her
Believe her, I don't do nothin I'm a ball
I'm a stand up nigga
I jump up everytime I fall
Everytime I lost I came back like cook crack
Got my hand up in the game and I ain't never look back
I said I'm good, I'm hood, I wish a nigga would
Try to take me for a sucker he get hit up just because
Can't shake em off for nothing, they be hating but for what
When I do they be like UHH!
Cause you a bug, you a flee and I'm a G
I ain't no Crip I ain't no Blood
But I don't bend no I don't budge
I keep that semi by my gut
I let that sig blow light em up
I say I ain't got that hazy
You know I got that kush
Niggas rolling on that dirt be smokin that Reggie Bush
Said they always speak my name
But when they see me they never look
Cause they know I keep that flamer
Goonies over there, and that ain't even counting for tooly that wear
E.A. they don't pop, lock, and drop it
Round here in North Philly
They stop, cock, and pop it
Put you on your dyin bed
Leave you on that lead dying
Bust ya head up out that bread
A nigga bet not dare try it
I'm a motherfuckin gangster
Spank you with that banger
Soak you with that toaster
You niggas straight cho-cha
Leave ya wet and gushy
I'm messin with some rookies
My drop top ridin
And my Glock cock ridin
And I'm hangin out that window and I won't stop firen
Til a nigga on the ground and he twitchin
His mama fillin reports da boy he missin
These niggas tellin lies they ain't never sold a pigeon
Just got to North Philly
And ask for that boy Gillie (They gonna tell you he's a gangster)
I'm Oschino
You know I got that fish if you tryna find nemo
If you try to burn me like that bitch Yolanda do niggas pee holes
Gucci frames they shade my vision
She on my dick like circumcision
Fuck that bitch let's get deez bucks
I bout my green in God I trust
And trust I grind and coupes I drop
More hot on da block
Like when a cop get popped
Standin tall as city hall
Weirdos I can't fuck with ya'll
Meek in his bag nigga I'm in da broad
My young bulls clap like a applause
Be on ya ass like polo draws
Gettin dollaz go-go bars
Why you think we go so hard
Hustle, rest, projects
Killin, shootin, lootin
We a mess
Burn it down nigga they correct
Go to war with the ATF
I do my thang, you ain't got no red stripes on your kicks
I do my thang, you ain't got no Audemar on your wrist
I do my thang, you don't walk around with stacks on deck
Looking flyer than a pilot put your diamonds on your neck
I do my thang, you ain't got no red stripes on your kicks
I do my thang, you ain't got no Audemar on your wrist
I do my thang!
Gucci hat to the Gucci sneaks
Gucci watch to the Gucci belt
Wear a lot of Gucci cause it make the bitch's coochi melt
Phantom door, suicide like that shit gon' shoot itself
Diamonds diamonds in my chain
Dollars dollars on my mind
Play the cut like iodine
O to the schi nigga you know me
Been an og I've been getting guap
All the money can't fit in no Timberland
I won't stop 'til I cop a house as big as your project block
Plus I like to shop a lot so I got to get this guap
I think I'm going blind cause all I see is just a dollar sign
Dollar sign, dollar sign, dollar sign, dollar sign, dollar signs
I do my thang, you ain't got no red stripes on your kicks
Looking flyer than a pilot put your diamonds on your neck
I do my thang, you ain't got no red stripes on your kicks
I do my thang, you don't walk around with stacks on deck
I do my thang!
Ask your hoe about me ya she know my name
And she report to me I call her Lois Lane
And I'm her Superman ain't no telling what coupe I'm in
I swoop up in, in a souped up Benz
Twenty-two dark rims, what you do nothing
Puffing on that kryptonite I'm gon' feel them lift tonight
If she don't suck my dick alright I just tell that bitch get nice
You ain't got no red stripes on your kicks
Them diamonds they look like a red light to a bitch
Make her stop, freeze, and everything's a go
We got that purple by the pound we got that work all by that O
You already know, this gon' ball the Audemar the way it glow
I keep them stacks in my pocket and that's all just for your hoe
Now let's go, that's when she stay
When it's light camera action
Pussy so wet and slippery I need traction
I do my thang, you ain't got no red stripes on your kicks
I do my thang, you ain't got no Audemar on your wrist
I do my thang, you don't walk around with stacks on deck
Looking flyer than a pilot put your diamonds on your neck
I do my thang, you ain't got no red stripes on your kicks
I do my thang, you don't walk around with stacks on deck
Looking flyer than a pilot put your diamonds on your neck
I do my thang!
Drop top, flip flop, big knot, Chris pop
Broke is just a joke and I ain't feeling like Chris Rock
Clocking like a a wrist watch that Lambo make a bitch stop
She be hypnotized, hypnotized like I'm Big Pop

She say that I'm cool smoother than velour
Much as I trap and hard as I go

Met her in Mia, was with my nigga Tre a week ago
In fact, he told that he ate two weeks before
She said she ain't fuck in months, I'm like you sneaky ho
But I switch them bitches like my sneakers though
Fucking all my homies she was trynna keep a secret though
Loving the crew, love the place for the team
She sucking my dick, guess she's chasing that dream

Tryna fall in love cause she know I'm bumpy rich
Hear my name ringing, she know I'm on my tip
2008 came in this game and I have made a grip
I’m sucker-duckin, fuckin' with the ones I made it with
One thing they knew about the hustle, I don't save a bitch
Basic bitch that we flippin' you be laying with
Her pussy played out, they call it Avirex
O-B-G-Y-N she got you in labor with
Your maybe baby cause you're weak and be chasin' your dick nigga

Oh lord, can't panic, don't panic
No time to plot it, no time to plan it
100 keys up in the attic, 100 keys up in the attic
Oh lord
2 birds in the kitchen; 1 brick, 1 desert Eagle
If the cops rush in, better flush it
Better pray to God they don't see you
Cause them F-E-D-S Boys want to L-I-F-and E you
So don't panic, don't panic, if they grab you
Don't panic, nigga dropping statements on the
Whole hood, they grabbed the nigga and he ramming
Got them young boys like 30 years still walking around
And he standing, bet that would've been one of my niggas
My lawyer cost 100 thou', nigga, rats telling with no remorse
Shoot at us, no reports, we shoot at them they going to court
And when them boys start rushing, nigga, just don't panic
Can't panic, don't panic
They knocking, don't panic
It's them people in penny-loafers
They searching people and searching sofas
No time to plot it, no time to plan it
100 keys up in the attic, 100 keys up in the attic
Oh lord
Pussy niggas panic, I could see they panties
Rain, snow, or sleet, I'm in these streets
And it's so organic, WB but no Atlantic
Play with me and I bet I'll handle it, 30 G's, 20 shows a month
That's too much to count and too much to manage
Motherfuck a hater, I done lived a hard life
Nigga Meek Milly, counted my first million
That's when my whole life changed, I pledge allegiance to the streets
That I'll never panic if them FEDS came
That's on everything, money, bag and the bread game
My partner and them is my partner and them
Can't panic, don't panic
They knocking, don't panic
It's them people in penny-loafers
They searching people and searching sofas
No time to plot it, no time to plan it
100 keys up in the attic, 100 keys up in the attic
Oh lord
(Cuff your chick)
You heard that
They call me Meek Milly aka Mr. Philadelphia
And as my nigga Big Re would say
If you don't like it kill your fucking self nigga
I got my first eight ball and I went bananas
Cause I started flipping like them little mini cameras
Turned that to a quarter turned a quarter into a half
Somebody tell them niggas with them bricks up on their ass
When I was broke he used to tell me go and get the loot
Hit you in your head you go in shock just like you're Pikachu
I see you chasing around them bitches trying to fit the [?]
That's why I'm at the dealer now trying to pick the coupe
Cause y'all was at the club and I was at the trap
Shit I was patient wasn't rushing like no running back
Shit I was waiting cause I had that money coming back
Put them youngins out there with that work and they was running back
Ya I'm like what you know about it
Ask them niggas about me in my hood they know I'm about it
Selling anything to make a profit
Money on my mind and my muhfucking conscience

See that bad bitch standing there that's my dope boy bitch
Six on your head shot
All these niggas sleeping on me about to get their bed rocked
Slide up on them niggas ask them niggas what their bread bout
Nigga where that bread at
Soon as them niggas pass off we back off and stamp out
I mean I be on a cash route
Get it on a fast route
Get it then we mash out
Ask me what my past bout
Big twenties the pass out
Fucking with them bitches tipped them brought my whole stash out
I hit my nect up he be like what now

We head hunting you should duck down
Or get bucked down when we bust around
Well I'm the dope boy
Wearing Gucci and that Louie boy
Money up to here but unemployed
Still selling them squares so my pockets getting bigger
I got it if you show it I don't care whoever know it
While I back up at the spot got an order for a block
Got to get that shit together cause the money never stop
Got the [?] in handy and I'm about to take a point
And I got these niggas fishing got their [?] all in they hands
But I got to hit the store cause I need another can
Now I'm in Home Depot about to cop some acetone
Told my cousin bring the press I'm about to make it stretch
Show you how to get that money that's a dope boy at his best
There's three types of niggas in life
Niggas that make it happen

And niggas that don't even know what the fuck is going on

Remember one year ago rocking Mike Kors
Now when I shop different bags in the stores
Cash out on a Audemar shining just like the stars
My jewelry box came with some burglary bars
I treated my diamonds like beauty bars
They be jumping around like a rock star
No Jackson 5 but it's 3 of us brothers
We keep the Nina now we pop stars

Got tired of runnin' to my mama for shit
So I kicked me a door in at 17
All of my brothers depend on me
All of my sisters depend on me
Don't run up on me askin' me for nothin'
You think I'ma ask for some Benjis? Fuck is you thinkin'?
If a nigga ask me do I need somethin', I get offended, come on
Breakin' the law with no codefendant
Go to jail, I get a lesser sentence

I used to beat up the pot, Adrian Broner
Aligator loafer, crocodile hunter
Young nigga I don't need assistance

When it come to the guala they callin' me Polomalu (run to the money)
Brokanese niggas still wearin' Prada
You know you broke, you don't think that's a problem
Askin' for money, that's not an option

Hit that bitch with that stick now he eat his food out a straw
Sippin' Actavis, I'm drinking syrup I don't got a cough

Dab on your bitch and I give her a heart attack
You still call it swag, don't call it that

Hoppin' in the hatch, Richard Mille max
You wanna offer me a 'mil you can have the deal back
Sticks in the field kill pull your weave back

I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most
Oh!
I gave her all I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we been jumped up out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) jumped up out the porch
I got so many decisions, ravens fly with the pigeons
I beat the pot, while you be the witness, try me – we don’t aim at kidneys
I throw back a perc’ to call my tensions; we pipe it up in the city
I got your hoe in my DM’s; I got your hoe at my mentions
Then they gone for a month
Then go to trapping all the way in Kansas
Nigga never rode a transit
Hit the pot, like a canvas
Feeling like Jamie Foxx, ‘cause I’m in love with a bitch named Fancy
When I started getting money, now you can’t stand me
I almost lost my life, one night in Miami
I go back to Miami, drinking out the hammock
I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she do the most
I gave her all I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we been jumped up out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) jumped up out the porch
We fly business; you mad ‘cause you flying coach, (lil bitty bitch) yeah you flying coach
I cannot love her, that bitch do the most
Want to slam my door, what you mad at me for?
But you calling my phone, standing at my front door
Kill yourself, jump off the building
I walk in the kitchen, grab the knife, and go slit your throat
I don’t do favors; you know that’s a no
Fucked them up on the dab, going up on the show
Kicking a door, when the bando get slow
F-f-f-fuck up the pot, they want more
These bitches fucking for (zero)
These bitches give it up
I guess you want lust for the trust
I’m like a squirrel; I just want me a nut
Take the pot and I give it an uppercut
Most of these niggas be dick riding nowadays
Tell these niggas to wrap it up
Like an octopus, I’m getting money in eight ways
Young Takeoff, my stack is up
Since I remember, two years ago made ‘em say bando
Remember they talked down and doubted us
Now when I walk the Earth, I make the street erupt
I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she do the most
Independent, we been jumped up out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) jumped up out the porch
We fly business; you mad ‘cause you flying coach, (lil bitty bitch) yeah you flying coach
I gave her the Beamer; I gave her the Rolls
But this little bitch still gon’ creep on her toes
I see the moves, so I watch how I move
She fucking niggas; she tryna’ to be cool
She broke as a bitch; she got nothing to lose
Giving it up just to put on some Loub’s
How can I lie, bet that thing like a pool
All of these bitches be loving the crew
Ain’t no one on one we fuck by the two
YRN fashion, I’m dabbing on you
You mad at me now, so I’m laughing at you
You something to do; you get hit in a room
Mama told me not to jump over broom
They hungry for money, they tryna’ get grooms
I think that I like the bitch, but I can’t wife the bitch
Whipping up crack; I can make a deuce
Bringing it back, make a brick turn to two
Bringing it back, make a brick turn to two!
I gave her all I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we been jumped up out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) jumped up out the porch

Dare a nigga try to break up in it
Came from the gump, I'm feeling like Forrest
Walking the trap I'm experimenting
It's a brand new day and a bird gon' sing
Rich niggas on the same thang

And these kids love me like I'm a cartoon
The streets are like the Vietnam war
When the bitches see me they get star struck
I can't argue with no niggas, cause shit can get physical
Bullets come flipping and it was critical
I don't think I hit 'em, but I know I hit 'em cause they calling them Whitaker
We got big guns like Marvin

She on vacation but stripping in Tennessee
I got her number, asked her what she doing later
I knew she was digging my pimping
And new Christian Louboutin's forgot to mention. (Red bottoms!)
I brought that bitch in my facility
Told her, "My favorite room in here's the kitchen, (In the kitchen)
After I whip all these chickens
I watch you get naked and wash all these dishes", (Wash all these dishes, bitch!)
She licked me, she fucked me, she sucked me
Then tried to give me a kiss, bitch you tripping (Huh?)
She wanna hit my muddy trouble double
I shouldn't have fucked her, now she's in her feelings, (What?)
Shawty broke down and start telling her business
I said to lil' mama, "You tripping
I don't give a fuck what you did, cause business is business." (Business is business!)
So now we sitting in my condo, (Top floor!)
I don't even know what to say no more
She's telling me, telling me she don't wanna be a freak no more, but...
I know she's a freak, super freak
Please do not try to run game on me, I'm not a 360
Then she told me (Ugh!) she don't wanna be a freak no more
She don't wanna be a freak no more (No more!)
She don't wanna be a freak no more
Don't wanna be freakin', no more
She don't wanna be a freak no more
She don't wanna be a freak no more
Don't wanna be freakin'

Ho fuck around, get kidnapped

Giving them hell, DJ Durel, watch the dope on the scale
Sippin' the lean, moving like snails, but I'm still wrappin' the bales belts
Clientele, clientele, bitch I've been running from twelve

And why you ain't pick up your phone?
I've been on the road stacking money
'Cause she stay at home alone
But it’s all good though

The OGs keep telling me "boy, you gon' make history"
Told my bitch you better ask about a nigga in these streets
We can go to MIA to see the palm trees

Wanna welcome you into my mansion with an invitation

Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
I had to fly out to Vegas to show her that I'm a player
Booty fatter than Deelishis, when I hit her we lay up
We together, get up on our knees and we say our prayers
Ain't no trials and tribulations, we having some patience
25 she got two cars, and a house that she pays for
So what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I didn't smash
And that taught me a lesson, lil' mama got to be special
She just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever
She know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish
When I hit her she be quitting cause she say it's too much pleasure
She telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy
She love it when I'm kissing on her body, start to melt her

We sticking together just like we salt and pepper
But it's all good though
Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
'Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room

I treated her like a queen, but she was the neighborhood whore
And now she tryna ride with me cause now I'm on tour
Money, money, money, money got my fingers sore

So you know when I sign that deal, got to know I ain't buyin' that ho no Bentley
Ain't seen him in two years, now he wanna come around, gotta know somethin' fishy
And I told my momma if somethin' happen to me, she can have my riches

Water whippin', show her how you did it

Now the time faster, I am the master
Every move I make, is spectacular
Northside is my nation, and I'm an ambassador
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
That woulda hurt my heart, prolly wouldn't have no heart
Prolly would've been stopped right then, prolly wouldn't been no start
Back to kickin' them doors, back to juugin' them cars
But I pray to God, cause he healed my mom
If you talkin' 'bout that bread, then I want every crumb
Runnin' to the money like I'm in a marathon
Smokin' on that kush, it smell just like an underarm
And the check say it wanna get married to my thumb
Goin' through it like a nigga locked up with no bond

Ballin out with my pimp, cross over Scotty Pippen
Yo main nigga, he wishin
Hand rolled up stinky
Might be bad til you get it
Red bottom she pickin
Then my hoe won’t have a ticket
Fabreger but no fendy
I’m a boss, bitch I hurt feelings
How does it feel to push them forgies on that Benz?
How does it feel to put that Rollie round yo wrist?
How does it feel to put yo feet in those kicks?
How does it feel to walk around with a big dick?
How does it feel to be real? How does it feel?
How does it feel to blow a mill? How does it feel?
How does it feel to have yo wrists on chill?
How does it feel to have them young niggas that gon kill?
Havin' mob ties
Came a long way from Perry Ellis
First time I seen a drug dealer
Meet the plug was on the movie Belly (woop)
Huncho season no lettuce (lettuce)
We only fuck her if she let us
She eat my hot dog with no relish (oh)
We don't do flex or wrestlin' (naw)
Quarter mill' down on my mansion (yup)
Magnum up under my mattress
Remember them niggas was laughin'
Remember them niggas was havin'
Remember them niggas was askin' (now)
Damn them niggas still askin' (aye)
Now it's 30k for a feature (thirty)
I thought you said you didn't see me
Now you wanna treat me like we been eatin' (oh)
Celiné bag was her dream bag
She thick as fuck
I've never seen that
Oh I’ve never seen that
I've never seen that
No no, I know you ain't never seen that
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
All eyes on me
Drop the top like I'm a samurai
I just wanna a hunna mill
House up on the hill
Sippin' out the seal
Lookin' at the sun rise
I just wanna look like  I'm a champion
I just wanna live better than average
I just wanna (x3)
I just want two bitches and they give me mouth
I just wanna (x3)
1991 I was established
Momma told me stop trapping and capping
I did not listen so I ended up with the savages
Stuck in the county couldn't do nothing it was tragedy
I just wanna look like I'm the president
All of the re up money I fucked up and I spent it
When I told my momma that we gon' be rich, nigga I meant it
I just wanna live like I'm a bachelor
Got the chef in the kitchen cooking up caviar
Doing hundred in the rari screaming fuck the law
Got the chopper aiming at you with the monkey balls
If I don't got the actavis then it's withdrawl
Got the pussy nigga missing like a sick call
I just wanna be on top and never ever fall
Up and downs in the trap like a see-saw
Trap, trapping out the gym without a basketball
I just want millions of dollars and partners that shoot you like shottas
I just wanna be what I wanna be
Got two lambo seats in the old school topless T
Cruising like Penelope
I grew up on the westside of avenue
Game in a knot like a tennis shoe
What you gonna do when the feds run into you
To locking the doors in the Bentley coupe
If my bro drop the pack, then you know I got it
The coupe got the gadgets its like robotics
Giuseppe Zanotti it mark my body
Young rich nigga still walking round with the profit
Tell you a story about one little bird
One little bird when the pecking on the curb
Did he get up, did he fly like a real bird
30 pointer, 40 pointer
Look at the Franck Muller
Walk in your city
I feel like a king
I am the ruler
(pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Who is the shooter
My niggas be trap off the calculator like computer
(gone)

Niggas be asking for money they thinking its funny, I don’t give them nothing
You niggas ain't bucking and no I ain't fronting

You laughing right now but don’t think shit won’t get ugly
Turn em into bread and peel back his muffin
You finger fuck light but that give him no budget
I’m smoking on cookie the cookie jar musty
Treat the blunt like teddy bears and I stuff it
You turn to a cop when you get guap and cuff it
Back and again all about Benjamins
I’m a human being forgive me if I sin
I done been broke before I ain’t going back no more
I done came this far to fall off the pedestal
I done took a walk and walk up to Texaco
Talk to Chico finessing him for Regano
You boys so crazy you can not cop a whole one you no friend or foe
The monts in my pocket sloppy joe
Break a ball like my name is Chris Jerico
Niggas my shooters have [?]
Chop off the top like I’m Eddie Guerrero
My niggas they ride around selling marshmallows
Nowadays niggas call me marshall lynch the way I got the Seahawks flying from Seattle
Stuck in the atlanta ocean canoe but got no pad to paddle
When I woke up this morning
I told myself I had to get some money

You see me ballin' now you finna' rush my nigga
I'm feelin like Hammer, can't touch my nigga
That's what I call Trap Funk my nigga
Looking like a young James Brown in the kitchen
Came in the game, can't trust these bitches
But everybody wanna' fall in love with these bitches
Run from on the north, take a hoe and make a million
Make a basic bitch feel like Hillary Clinton
Let's talk about the rapper swagger jagger niggas
Put the powder on my hand so I can smack a nigga
I had powder on my hand before the rapping nigga
On the north turned the bando to a mansion nigga
Million dollar cash in the duffel
Gotta' pay for fore' you snatch it
Grandmama died, momma cried a million times
Pistol Pete died, still cried a million times
Life paid off all these hard ass years
Money don't change, but the money change bills
Damn, life was so hard (life was so hard)
Life was so hard I prayed to God
Shit weren't good everyday nigga I had it hard
Quit sprinting out the crib running from 12 dropping the cars
I have been through the jungle and forest, came out with no scar
Remember the day at momma house sleep
Quavo woke me up in my sleep
Had one Jordan on his feet
We tripping, looking out for the police
He said not only did I lose my shoe, lost my ID
Take you back about a year ago, trapping it at the bando
Way before niggas begin using the Migos flow
When my pockets was hurting I had to kick a door
I go to sleep, I was dreaming about hitting the lotto
Wake up in reality, he gotta get every dollar
You told me to give it up, but watch how you gone' follow
Niggas that talking they gone' holla
Brush the dirt off my collar
Get back to the guala
Yea niggas, still jugg season (you forgot)
Errbody' know we got no label (independent nigga)
We came in as young rich niggas
One man down but nobody can replace him (Offset)
I don't fear nobody, only my creator (God)
Ain't no pray to nobody only my savior
I don't fuck with none of you niggas cuz' you fugazy
Life's hard life is whatever you make it
Damn, life was so hard (life was so hard)
It was so hard  (life was so hard)
Fuck, life was so hard (life was so hard)

Only thing they can do is congratulate me
Mama told me if you kicking in doors
"Quavo that's the price you gotta pay it"
Once upon a time
Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
My niggas came from the pavement
Talking that shit boy save it
You talking 'bout cookies, we baking
I fell in love with the faces
Quarterback Migos, Troy Aikman
Screaming out mama we made it
Young nigga came from the bottom
Young nigga go get the guala
Trap out a hotel Ramada
They calling me Quavo Mufasa
Open the trap like carcass
We knowing you niggas imposters
They liking the Piña colada
I remix it with a lil' powder
Hit a nigga with a chopper
It will take about forty-eight hours
The Chattahoochee where they found him
My niggas go get the bounty
We hold 'em up for ransom
Migos on top of the mountain
I got the pigeons and falcons
Now I got the keys, I used to trap ounces
Came from the boards on the houses
Them niggas is telling I'm calling them mouses
Free Bobby Shmurda and free my boy Rowdy
I came from the pavement
Look at them niggas they mad that I made it
Look at their faces
'Cause I'm at the top can nobody replace it
I used to be robbing
Hang with the goons, my niggas were goblins
Turning the North side into a lil' Harlem
Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
My niggas came from the pavement
Talking that shit boy save it
You talking 'bout cookies, we baking
I fell in love with the faces
Screaming out mama we made it
My niggas came from the pavement
So many chains like a slavery
Taking a trip to Croatia
Plug sent the pack be coming in from Haiti
Counting up these Benjamin faces
Young nigga, I got rich off of Caucasian
Migo my gang, ain't no trading
Fucking these bitches, they from different races
Rick Owens, they came with no laces
Cooking up dope and the junkies gonna taste it
Your bitch gave me brain, that's my favorite
Told that bitch watch her teeth 'cause she got braces
People gon' hate on me, just 'cause I made it
Talk about me like we might be related
You need to sue your jewelry, Rollie outdated
I be in the bando with the dope boys slanging
Pouring up a soda, I leave it contaminated
All of my niggas that screaming out mama we made it
Now one of them chains is yours around your neck
We start from the North side, screaming free Offset
I gave him a test, get a vest, and then get hit with the Tec
Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
Talking that shit boy save it
You talking 'bout cookies, we baking
Quarterback Migos, Troy Aikman
Screaming out mama we made it
(Hook)
I just blew my mind cuz my mama seen it (fuck!)
And she had a fit, yea she had a fit (mama)
I told my mama we rich, told my mama we rich (rich, go!)
Seen 100 bands, all in one time (I did)
And she had a fit, yea she had a fit (mama)
I told my mama we rich, told my mama we rich (go go go go)
(Verse) (Quavo of the Migos)
Mama had a fit when she seen my money
She say you ain’t got no job, you must be up to something
What the hell you doin? Don’t get in no trouble
I had to look out for my nephew, he look up to uncle
Mama got a nigga, I ain’t like his ass
Tried to make me rake the leaves and cut the grass
Nigga you ain't even got no kids, what make you dad?
Mama kicked him out and now I’m 21
Mama taught me everything, I’m her Danielson
I had to go get her that Porsche before the summer’s gone
(Hook)
(Verse) (Gucci Mane)
I was servin junkies out my mama window
Daddy gone so I guess that makes me head honcho
Mama ramblin through my closet, she done found a spliff
She said I raised you better, boy you’ve got a strong mind
I was a runner for my brother, I need my own plug
I feel like 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne, I need my own drugs
First time I set shop on my block I didn’t get no luck
(Hook)
The Audi, the Mazzi, the Jaguar
The Bentley, the house by the lake
Gold on my neck, gold on my wrist
Young Takeoff I sit on 10 K’s
I’m posted with Guwop, I’m strapped up with 2 Glocks
Versace on my back, I’m feelin like 2 Pac
He wanted a whole brick, I gave em re-rock
Pull up on yo block, Chevrolet t-top
Finesse the plug for the bags
My wrist is spinnin like Taz
I know that my mama gone spaz
She find out bout all of this cash
But fuck it, my nigga we rich
Duckin police, jumpin the fence
Now we in Lambs, president tint
Seen 100 bands, all in one time (I seen it)
I just blew my mind cuz my mama seen it (fuck!)
And she had a fit, yea she had a fit (mama)
I told my mama we rich, told my mama we rich
(Hook)

We was some crazy young niggas huh?
I'd like to welcome you to Yung Rich Nation
I know you been patiently waiting
Yung Rich Nation that's the album
Tryna turn the mansion to a castle
Diamond shine came from Africa, shine, shine (Africa)
(Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors) Ooh, damn, bachelor
Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
(If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ya, pitiful) Sad to say
First check bought a Audi Coupe
It was black and grey like the Raiders
It was 10 bands so I paid it
Remember the time, Offset he got me high
That was right by the neighbors house?
Remember the time we broke in the neighbors house
That was our first paper route
12 tried to make it my fault
Remember the time you niggas laughed at me
Said that I wouldn't bond out
You say that you trappin', take you to the bando
Hand you a fork, see what you bout
Before we made the song Hit Em' wit it
We was knockin' niggas out
Before we made the song 'Birds', pelicans fly to the south
Niggas talkin' stupid up in crowd
Jumped in the crowd and punched em' in the mouth
First time we in Miami, we had a gangsta shootout
Dope in my sock, and we beat the trap out
Don't come in my trap if you unannounced (Pussy)
Diamond shine came from Africa (Shine, shine, Africa)
If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ch'ya (pitiful, sad to say)
Remember the time, I did my first break and enter?
Cause I ain't want my uncles know I did it
Remember the time I got kicked out for havin' gas stashed in my locker?
In the gym choppin' it up wit my partners
Next thing you know got walked out by the coppers
First juug I hit at school, Lord please forgive me
I know you remember that
Got home and counted the check
I'm thinkin' to myself Takeoff what you gon' do wit that
Call the plug up ask him where he at
I'm celebratin' smokin' back to back
Remember that time Quavo came home with a full grown marijuana plant
Stinkin' up the crib tryin' dry it off in the oven it was still wet
I got that dope talkin' anthrax, hit a fat one when we hit for fifty racks
Diamond shine came from Africa (Shine, shine, Africa)
Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors (Ooh, dab, bachelor)
Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
From riding Impala with them things
To driving Ferraris with them wings, nigga
Slide in the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas get a hearse for 'em
Fuck you niggas even sellin work for
Be the main reason pussy niggas gettin' murked for
Little nigga, who you work for?
Cause I came for the bosses I ain't for no losses
You playin', it's dirt for 'em
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a turf war
Then hit the road for my first tour
My level went up to the third floor
And I swerved on these hating niggas
MIA with some Haitian niggas
I pulled up in that Wraith nigga like whoa!
(Let me talk, Meek Mill)
I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now
All of my life, I only wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga
Make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped out the Lamb' like Bruce Wayne
The ten-piece of chicken is on the way
I told 'em Carlito to andale
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know!
Heroin black, look like Willie B
If you do the coke, you gon' buy some skis
I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
Young Takeoff, I am a professional
Vegetarian, only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
You ain't never seen no work as flexible
And I turn on the stove, and I'm whipping the brick
Win the judge ten times, what a miracle
I had to put food on the plate!
Asking the Lord, "give a nigga some faith"
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but, nigga, I got me a check!
I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know, M&Ms)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater (splash), you don't know how I'm feeling right now
Damn DJ Plugg, you just killed this
I fucked the thot and she straight out of Magic (thot)
You work with the fed boy, I hear all that static
I used to sleep on the pissy ass mattress
Now I sleep on a bad bitch and she plastic (bad)
Throw me the brick and you know I'ma catch it (hey)
Dick on the stick, nigga go in a casket (brrp)
Poppin' that shit, he been poppin' that shit (hold up)
I just paid a lil' 40 to go and go get it (pop it, pop it, pop it)
They diggin' that shit, how I'm livin' and shit
You ain't take nothin' but a quarter, nigga (huh?)
We get the bricks over borders, nigga (borders)
I took a bitch to the mansion
I kicked the bitch out because she tried to record a nigga (yah)
I got more water than Florida, nigga
Diamonds dancing, doing jumping jacks
Bitch for every letter in the alphabet
Bust down the Rollie, can't see where the time's at
Drunk me a 4 in the 20 ounce pineapple
Snake with my neck, I think I hear a rattle
Serving the junkies I grew up a bastard
Smoking moonrocks, I'm going to NASA
Bands on me like I'm having a battle
Sherbert the cookie, it don't even matter
In the foreign gettin' road head from a dancer
I'm in designer made from a panda
I come in this bitch lit like a candle
Too many bricks, gotta sort 'em (bricks)
Look at my wrist, it's water (water)
Your favorite top model a snorter (wooh)
Fuck how you feel, abort 'em (fuck it)
I'm in the field, Portis (field)
Empty the shell, tortoise (rah)
Give me the bail, ornament (bail)
Name a lil' bitch I ain't goin' to get (bitch)
Police tryna steal like the Hornets (twelve)
Send me ten bricks and have fun with it (ten)
If it ain't clean, I don't want it (clean)
Drop me a ten for opponents (ten)
You get a mule or a donkey (mule)
Just give me the extras, I want it (wooh)
I'm with your broad and all
I'm with my dogs and all
We pulling up on you and tie-dyeing the walls (whoa)
I got the 9, the uzi, the big bazooka, it's just for a cause (wooh)
And you know I keep the white girl
They call a young nigga mardy
I like to welcome you all, welcome you all to the migo party
Welcome to Milan, my niggas be living like talibans
I got kickstand, got molly santan, be running around in Milan
My niggas is juugin' finnesin' in every season
Had to draw down on a fuck nigga the other day cause he thought I was easy
50 gold bottles of the ace of spades looking like they bringing me a deck of cards
God gave me a second chance so young nigga gotta go super hard
Beat the pot like Zab Judah
Mansion party kick it in Bermuda
Callin' up flippa that nigga my shooter
Cut them to pieces then put em' in coolers
Pocket rocket in the club with me
Lil' mama, lil' mama no dancing on me
Got bags in the party no groceries
When you grow up nigga you don't wanna be me

Fuck nigga

Snow bun its like the cocaine in iCarly
Could be the Fisker but I chose the Rari
Brought her a shrimp plate when we ate at Bennies
She get freaky [?] when she sip the Henny
I'm fucking all night if the molly get in
The gangster being in me so I keep a semi
She came to party she bought her own Whiskey
I hit it from the back and then bust on her titties
My diamonds on glacier, my rollies on fleek
Monopoly money [?]
Can you take three shots quick flash in a hurry
The way I slam dunk the pot
And you know I keep the white girl
Call it Jessica Simpson
They call a young nigga mardy
So what part of Atlanta y'all from?
From the north side
Uh, yeah
Every show get crazy and crazy
We growing and growing every, every, every time at a show
Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
We killed the Versace, we went to Bahamas, shout out to the islands
Mommas and daughters they taking a picture with me and they smiling
Billboard magazine, 45K
Word on the street they say the Migos wanted
But they can't find the Migos, so they bite their recorders
When you ask for a show, can you seriously afford it
Check my dab, it's priceless
And my niggas is righteous
I don't got no type, but I love to fuck Pisces
YRN Tha Album first album going diamond
Got my mama a Benz
Just to show her I'm grinding
Green dots in the pen but I hate the confinement
When Offset got out of jail he ate a bowl of hundreds
Dropped the Rich Nigga Timeline and we was crossed the country
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up
Skrrt, cook up
Graat, he shook up
I'm trapping the white, that Ku Klux
My niggas got grenades and bazookas
A hundred thousand, got a pick up in India
Headed to locker, we changed the millennium
Thirty thousand for a walk through minimum
Snakes in the grass start spitting out venom
That come with the territory when a nigga winning
Tinted windows on the sprinter you don't need to see this image
The blogs say I need to calm down, fuck a image
Choppa sound like percussion, run up on me repercussion
Came from nothing, came home with a half a million, hurt my stomach
I'm taking good care of my kids but they mamma get nothing
And if you think its wrong this ain't the right song you're bumping
Welcome to the jungle, lions, elephants and monkeys
Never see me lonely, best believe nina on me
Stuffed crust, my pocket walking with a 50 on me
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up
Pyrex pot on the stove, take that eggbeater cook up
They looking for the origin, wanna know how did we make this shit up
Came in there right and we fucking it up
Jump off the banana boat, call me King Tut
Niggas be biting our swag I tried to switch it up
But these niggas still don't get enough
Niggas with attitude don't give a fuck
Young nigga flexing never did a push up
Every ten years it's on my story bro
I bet you listen up, you don't gotta like it
Yo favorite rapper he be biting
When I step in the booth, its a moment of silence
I bet yo bitch she get excited
When I'm doing show my front end and that back end be enormous
I need a double cup with my Backwood when I'm on stage performing
Can't get in my tour bus bitch, ain't tryna fuck, it's only 5 in the morning
I got some Dominican bitches that sucking and fucking and back to the origin
Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

Remember kickin' in your door takin' flats
Trap on the block whether rain, sleet, or snow
Young nigga tryna make a dope deal
They askin' me questions like Dr. Phil
Now we independent, worth a couple M's
Came a long way from bustin' out sticks and stems
It's a lot of shit that I regret I did
Can't let negativity get to me
I take a private jet to Sicily
Don't fuck with you niggas, you sneakin' (Naw forreal)
Can't turn my back on the hood, need me (Naw forreal)
When you gettin' money, stack it up for a reason (Naw forreal)
Take a look at my life back then, trap season (Naw forreal)
When you make it, everybody think that it's easy (Naw forreal)
My family need me (Naw forreal, forreal)
My squad let me lead 'em (Naw forreal, forreal)
Wake up in the morning,  gotta thank God
Shake a 7/11 in the dog pound
I'm for real, nigga, you can ask about us, nigga
We earn stripes on the Nawfside
Just another day, just another day
Real talk, nigga
I know niggas took a loss, nigga
On the Nawfside, it's just another day on the Nawfside
On the North, it's just another day on the Nawfside
It's just another day, what is a day on the north?
Wake up in the morning, they kick in the door
We looking for money, we looking for gold
My niggas 100, my niggas on go
My niggas is trapping, dapping, what is you having?
Run with the sack and I go hit the hole
I run the game
Look at my house, take a look at my ring
Walk in the North and I know I got rank
Pull up in the North and remember the day
And I took me a flight to the Everglades
I told 'em that day that it was my way and never get paid of 50k
Nigga, they bucking, they rubbing, they sacking
Taking the pounds and breaking them down
What a beautiful day, my AK came equipped with 100 rounds
Niggas talking like they got the crown
Find their body in the lost and found
Chopper louder than surround sound
It's an undercover in the underground
Just another day on the Nawfside rollin' (rolling)
Riding around trying to get it in, 2Pac all eyez on me (2Pac)
My young nigga hit a 100 band jugg in the club it was stolen
Young nigga still strapped by the North side
Gwinnett County patrolling
Trapping on Club Drive, Migos the Army got Mob ties
Kick in the door a million times
My nigga Westside he had to do five
The hood were crying when Pistol Pete died
You gotta survive ,the streets will eat you alive
You said that you hard, you niggas are frauds
I went to the pen and them times were hard
You niggas is bitches, you wear leotards
Bitches they mad cause I broke their heart
Beating the pot like it's martial arts
I came from mug shots
To posters on the block
Keep our song on replay
Now all we need is 3 Mics and a DJ
3 Mics and a DJ x3
Know 3 young niggas on the North
By name of Quavo, Offset and Takeoff
Squad open the trunk and I pull out that sawed off
Cutomuto he gone cut your throat, Migos dressed in the cut knock your jaw off
I came from bitches staring at me
Brazilians, Snow Bunnies, and I like Dominicans
Gold on my Giuseppe Steppers, red on the bottom on my Christian Louboutins
I used to be jugging, finessing, remixing the plug on the island like Gillegan
The block on fire, I can extinguish it
3 mics 3 mics 3 mics nigga that changed my life
Mama she told me get right
Now I rock the stage and I get paid, it's 50k in my resume
Now I'm riding round president tints on a Escalade
Rocking out shows on the gravey
I told my mama we made it, Harriet Tubman chains no slavery
Play with the water like Navy
3 mics we don't need a fucking deal
Back in the day a flamingo DJ Ray G playing Bando
Bitches wanna come and mingle
Zonatti Guiseppe wrapped round my socks
We came along way from mug shots
Ducking and dodging the cops Ray G to me Offset stop
Offset never listen had to do a sentence when i got out we took to the top
Cooking the dope will get bagged like a replay
You know what I am
Mansion for the bachelors
Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula
Nah, you know I don't like no camera (nah!)
Your bitch she like an animal attackin' us
She won't leave me 'lone, she love the bachelor
Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors
Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors
Quavo, I am a bachelor
Look at the way I'm dabbin' like a pastor (I'm dabbin' ain't it)
I am a bachelor
Rockin' the shows, smashin' hoes right after
Got your bitches workin', calling me master
Came from the bottom and now I got guala
Graduated, now a nigga's a bachelor
Flippin' your ho like a spatula
Don't get me wrong, I still whip up with spatulas
Migos we don't like the cameras
We find out that we can make millions with it
So we started flexin' like bachelors
Came from stashing money in the ceilin'
Young niggas why don't you wanna be bachelors?
Came from kicking doors, juugin' plug for the bows
And now we taking trips to Africa, Africa
Niggas say that they are entrepreneurs
I don't see the millions that you pursuin'
Statistics in black and white, what is you doin'?
Top the charts every time we drop a new one
Mansion for the bachelors
Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula
Nah, you know I don't like no camera (nah!)
Your bitch she like an animal attackin' us
She won't leave me 'lone, she love the bachelor
Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors
Bachelors, bachelor, bachelors, ooh bachelor
Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors
Whippin' the dope, with the Terminator break the spatula
Get the pack and then I wrap it up and then I bag it up
If I catch a mug I'll charge a private jet to Canada
Promoters ain't got my money, I'm shootin' up your manager
Fuck it my nigga, we shootin' innocent bystanders
Pull up with choppas and make a nigga call the ambulance
Drinkin' on Actavis and I'm rollin' up cannabis
Hoes runnin' 'round the lobby geekin' up and their panties wet
I had a cuban link and Rolex before the rap shit
I just adapt to the trap cause that's my habitat
I'm in the corner catchin' the work like a cornerback
Runnin' to the money, my nigga, think I'm a running back
Niggas still trappin' quarters, make 'em give their quarter back
Forty pointers in my Breitling, oh that's what you lookin' at?
Mansion for the bachelors
Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula
Nah, you know I don't like no camera (nah!)
Your bitch she like an animal attackin' us
She won't leave me 'lone, she love the bachelor
Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors
Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors
She lookin' at my diamonds, hallucinating on ‘shrooms
Hold a nigga rest and beat his head in with a broom
Got the bird that be flyin' like caterpillars out cocoons
Pull up in the Bentley, think you seen a fuckin' Jeeper Creeper
Got that 9 on my waist like a two-way beeper
I'm a bachelor, I got a oil factory in Africa
Trapper turned rapper then rapper turned into a massacre
Then beat a nigga, stomp a nigga, I will not account
From the beginning these bitches, they wasn't shit, they ate the apple
I had a warrant with the sack, the police tried to make a tackle
Green Bay with the green, vacuum seal it, I'm a Packer
Just because you rap about it, you are not a trapper
Mansion for the bachelors
Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula
Nah, you know I don't like no camera (nah!)
Your bitch she like an animal attackin' us
Bachelors, bachelor, bachelors, ooh bachelor
Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors

Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
What you want a whole bag or a half a bag?
I need cash, I need cheese, nigga I need all my racks
Running from the task, silver block with them tags
I got stinky kush pack it smell like a trash can
Whip it on the stove then I cool it with the fan
Addicted to the whole bag can't even serve a gram
And I'm doing it for my niggas that be locked up in the slam
Price tags on the bag, in the glass baths
Foreign plug overseas, get my work from Trinidad
Got bombs of the gas like I'm in Afghanistan
And I'm posted on an island, you can call me Gilligan
In the bando wrapping packs in Saran
Some of the bricks be white, some of them bricks be tan
Posted on the block with a whole fucking bag
12 pull up, everybody ran
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Quarter bag, half a bag, I need the whole thing
Red and white, pull up in the Lamb, candy cane
Got damn, racks too heavy I need a cane
Two styrofoams filled up, I'm drinking on Wayne
Foreign bad bitch in my crew, she came from Spain
On the phone catching play while I'm getting brain
Yeah he say he want that white, but the drama came
Make the work disappear, call it David Blaine
Walk around nina on my hip, John Wayne
Pull up in the dump, Lebron James
10 chains on my neck, but I'm not a slave
Batman coupe, pull up in the Batcave
Old money on me so they call me OJs
Run away with the set like OJ
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Got the bag on my back like a soldier
Gucci bag and its a roller
And it filled up with the doja
Got lean in my cup no Foldgers
And I pulled up in a Rover
And I hit hoes like Sammie, no Sosa
No coke - aina, no teaser, take trips, no visa
I make a hurricane, no FEMA
.36 hold it up like a nina
And I pulled up in the beamer
And I got dough, Little Caesars
The block so hot, catch a fever
Got beans, got lean, got gas
Niggas better come with that cash
Gucci bag came with the flag
Hell yeah I just fucked my team
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag

Nigga tell me what you'd do for the dope
Kick doors, rob a store, and a nigga gonna give him point four
I pull out, Maserati, smelling like that kush cologne
Waiting on big bruh to come home, counting up checks while I'm getting dome
Sipping on lean, out the Styrofoam
Got an extendo filled up with strong
Been dropped a sack on the whip
Been dropped a sack on the chain
Been dropped a sack on the watch
Been dropped a sack on the ring
Been finessing the plug
Nigga been sold them drugs
Robin jeans with the stud
Been dropped a sack on the watch
Been dropped a sack on the chain
Been dropped a sack on the whips
Been dropped a sack on the ring
Been finessing the plug
Nigga been sold them drugs
Been dropped a sack on the Tru's
Robin jeans with the stud
Drop the sack, drop the sack
Fuck check up get it right back
My niggas don't know how to act
And I still got bricks like Shaq
Went to sleep today off the Act
In the strip club fuck a pussy stat
Hit the block then I fuck up them bags
Hit the lot, drop a sac on a Jag
Then drop another sac for the stash
Good pack smelling like the trash can
Disappear I clear my hands
Trying to sack up with my nigga Sosa
No triple-A, yeah the game over
I know niggas that bite like a Cobra
Wrap the pack up, ship it overseas
I got anything a nigga need
Been dropped a sack on the whip
Been dropped a sack on the chain
Been dropped a sack on the ring
Been finessing the plug
Nigga been sold them drugs
Been dropped a sack on the Tru's
Robin jeans with the stud
Been dropped a sack on the watch
Been dropped a sack on the chain
Been dropped a sack on the whips
Been dropped a sack on the ring
Been finessing the plug
Nigga been sold them drugs
Been dropped a sack on the Tru's
Robin jeans with the stud
Big on big
Big on big
If you havin' paper and I'm havin' paper
How you gon' big on big?
If you havin' neighbors and I'm havin' acres
How you gon' big on big?
How you gon' big on big?
If I'm trappin' that gas, you trappin' that mid
How you gon' big on big?
If I pull out a dub, you pull out a ten
If your bitch is a five, my bitch is a ten
How you gon' big on big?
You drivin' a Jag, I'm pushin' a Benz
How you gon' big on big?
How you go Sig on Driz?
How you pour one up the seal?
How you gon' do what I did?
How you gon' say you is real?
He ain't touch it or know how it feel
Nigga talkin' 'bout they independent
Turned around and 360 the deal
Nigga walkin' 'round with 30s on them
Vacuum sealed and ready to sell
M&M in the mail, I done took a lot of L's
Hundred niggas with the shells, goin' big, whale
(Can't go big on big)
We the biggest shit poppin', wrist water, no faucet
Bando to a mansion, you havin' condo status
Ever since I was a lil' boy, yeah, I'm havin' Huncho status
Know how to solve a problem, know how to sell a brick
You might be poppin' them bottles, I'm poppin' them bottles and models
You might be ridin' American, my whips is foreign, the throttles
You tryna go big on big? stop it
She get on that pole, get bi-polar
Still goin' big, cup like Magnolia
If you havin' paper and I'm havin' paper
How you gon' big on big?
If you havin' neighbors and I'm havin' acres
How you gon' big on big?
If I got the Draco and you got the Sig
How you gon' big on big?
If I'm trappin' that gas, you trappin' that mid
How you gon' big on big?
If I pull out a dub, you pull out a ten
How you gon' big on big?
If your bitch is a five, my bitch is a ten
How you gon' big on big?
How you gon' big on big?
How you gon' big on big?
How you gon'... flex on the squad?
When you know... the bag is large?
Where were you... when times was hard?
It's pitiful, how you gon' big when we extra large?
Four car garage... two bad broads
I don't flex or floss... I'm a rockstar
With no guitar, Lambo avatar (Lambo)
Sippin' on some tar (Act) I'm livin' above the bar
Your lil' hoe... been my hoe (Smash smash)
Green Lambo... Piccolo (Skrr skrr)
Diamonds drippin' on me, Nickelodeon (Splash)
(You makin' me sick)
I own all of my cars, jewelry, and I got property
(I got some property)
Building these houses in places, I'm playing Monopoly
If you havin' paper and I'm havin' paper
How you gon' big on big?
If you havin' neighbors and I'm havin' acres
How you gon' big on big?
If I got the Draco and you got the Sig
How you gon' big on big?
If I pull out a dub, you pull out a ten
How you gon' big on big?
If your bitch is a five, my bitch is a ten
How you gon' big on big?
How you gon' big on big?

Can't go big on big
Can't go big on big

I'm an OG in my hood, no Aretha, well respected
I see falcons on a daily basis, Takeoff Arthur Blank
Whippin' chickens in the kitchen, trap smell like a septic tank
Black n' gold everything, talkin' 'bout jewelry, not the sink
My plug Carlito, he can't speak no Englo
All he knows is "andale"
I got bandos for the L-O
State-to-state, no real estate
Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (skrt, skrt, skrt)
Can't fuck with you niggas, I'm sorry (no way)
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird

Oh, I counted 10 mil in a year
10,000 feet in the air
You seein' that picture is clear

Lil mama keep asking "who is scotty?"
Got bitches on bitches, they lick it off of they body

Got bitches on bitches, they licking it off of they body
Got bitches on bitches, they licking it off of they body
Look at them bitches, they look at each other
Two bitches from France, they fight in my covers
When I pass you the molly I want you to lick it up off of her body
I'm sorry for yellin' but I am a player but I am no Bell Ami
I pull up on double cup Actavis, my pimpin' good on that Hennessy
When I became a young millionaire the people remember me
50 bitches in the lobby

I told 'em it's molly
Lick it off of they body
Lick it off of they body

Got bitches on bitches, they lick it off of they body
Lick it off of they body
Lil mama keep asking "who is scotty?"
Lickin' they body
Lickin' the molly
Shawty so hot I might hit in the lobby
But don't tell anybody, don't tell anybody
Flew me a brick, try to buy me a Bugatti
I might crash me jet with a bitch in the pilot
Runnin' the lobby, got bitches on scottie
That scottie is molly, they lickin' it off of they body
Pull up in the Audi, (?) Kawasaki, dressed in nickel body
I love my bitches like my marijuana, gotta be exotic, come in from the tropics
Pocket rocket, I keep right in my pocket
Call it Houston Rockets, tote them like a psychic
Bop-bop-brhh

I told 'em it's molly
Got bitches on bitches, they lick it off of they body

Lick it off of they body
Lil mama keep asking "who is scotty?"
Had to tell 'em it's molly
Got bitches on bitches, they licking it off of they body
Got bitches on bitches, they licking it off of they body

You goin' gold or you ridin' chrome?
Maybach Music
Pussy niggas wanna see you dead
Cause them pussy niggas never see the bread
Black bottles and the gold chains
Ho swallowin' my whole name (Rozay)
I got some niggas that'll slide for me
Left hand for the styrofoam
I gave my shone a student loan
That bitch's mouth made the honor roll
Down to do work, nigga, no gloves
Just got me 2 birds from ol' boy
I always look out for ol' boy
Belaire, my refrigerator
I ate your bitch out on the dinner table (woo)
Black bottles and the gold chains (huh)
Want the half or the whole thing?
You goin' hard or you goin' home?
My mama told me get money and stay alive (mama)
I can't make the deal, I think he wearing a wire
Pitching hard ball and they hit it, call 'em Mark McGwire
I'm meeting up with Pele Migo, that's my ese
He ain't ever have a private jet, but work on runways
My wrist whip the magic, Quavo Hardaway
3,000 birds in the air, I call it Andre
I was nothin', turned into somethin', these bitches want me
I came from the bando, lot of bags, but no groceries
Pull up in the foreign, that's the trunk where the motor be
Bottles in that VIP, bring out the camera, Spike Lee
Want the half or the whole thing?
You goin' gold or you ridin' chrome?
(Takeoff!)
Lookin' at my Breitling, it got VS-1 stones
Lately lot of you niggas been rockin' rhinestones
Talkin' 'bout you on the block, Macaulay Culkin, home alone
Walkin' around with that sack, no 6, nigga walking with a 50
It's Migo gang, QC the label, fuck niggas better get with it
After my show, I'm on top of your ho, nigga autographin' bitches titties
For the price of fame and never fold
Act tough behind the internet
A nigga takin' chains, Debo
24k on my toes
My Maison Margiela's, they rose gold
Trappin' and dabbin', I trap in the rain, sleet, or snow
Black bottles and the gold chains
Want the half or the whole thing?
You goin' hard or you goin' home?
You goin' gold or you ridin' chrome?
Drug deala, gotta keep the 9 milla
Finessin' the plug for the work
I cross him over, no dribble
Sippin' Rose after the day I had a court date
Tried to fuck lil mama, I don't really like no foreplay
I hit him in the mouth, he thought he had a damn toothache
Most of you niggas are too fake
They watchin' a nigga like Blu-Ray
You talkin' 'bout that blow, but you can't be from in the kitchen
Whippin' up Alicia Keys
You say that you got the big money
But really your money is sesame seeds
I got this bitch named Valerie, she bring me bricks from Sicily
My neck is flooded and my double cup is mudded
The streets made me a villain, out that bowl, I made a million
Black bottles and the gold chains
Want the half or the whole thing?
You goin' hard or you goin' home?
You goin' gold or you ridin' chrome?
Black bottles and the gold chains
Wearin' gold from the cocaine
Boil kilo in the crockpot
'Nother drug dealer on the car lot
Ayy, let me hear that ho, Jeff
Official tishial (what?)
I fucked that bitch I cannot miss her
Your bitch in the gang, let her blow the whistle
I bought me the Rolls, this not a rental
I gave her a bag, that bitch a winner (bag)
She wanted steak, got the chicken dinner
You got it? Then show the cash (racks)
The money come fast, just like the dash
So I gotta blow the bag (what?)
That bitch she bad
She let me smash, she on me like shoulder pads
Playing with the check
Young nigga imma blow the racks (racks!)
Spend a whole 100 nigga imma go make it....
I cut up too deep, he get to stitching
Then go and switch a new color Bentley
Circle the frames, John Lennon
How much it paid? Mind your business (cash)
Free all my dawgs they got sentenced (sentenced!)
If they don't, we gon' shoot the lieutenant (bow!)
My family proud, no Penny (proud!)
My dog collar got VV's
Not sorry for niggas no pity (nah)
Celebrate with the gang
Order up singles and throw 'em on titties (Takeoff!)
Official tishial, call triple
'Tryna get a 20 up out of that nigga (twenty!)
She want the purple pickle in the mink for the winter
I drive the Rolls [???]
Baguette the Patek its cold
You touch on my wrist and you might just shiver (ice)
Serial killing 'em (killing 'em!)
Your backend got minimal, pitiful
Once the condition is critical (critical)
Migo gang we going digital (go!)
Turn on our TV (why?)
My momma just said that she see me (momma!)
The guys say it's Eliantte, they don't need glass
And when it's smoke
You notice that we the ones come
Look at them niggas they starving 'cause they not eating (starve)
I put my wrist in the pot that's a [?] man
Then I get to beating (let's go)
Everyday my bitch b-day
Park the car, put her out on the freeway (let's go)
Only way that I'm living expensive
They think imma tip 'em
I got whole different colors like Skittles (let's go)
Park my new shit and hop in a rental (slide)
You fuck up my vibe I might spin her
All my diamonds VV's I ain't kidding (bling)

Young rich nigga shit, man

Yo' bitch wanna fuck the squad

Bow, bow, gruow, gruow

I know niggas that remix, re-rock the whole chicken
Gotta watch for them snake niggas plotting
Young rich nigga
I'm walking around with the rocket
I ain't even gon' touch you I'ma let my man's get you
Remember me hitting the juugs and licks, and ducking and dodging the cops
I feel like 2Pac, it's me against the world and I can't be stopped
Yo' bitch wanna fuck the squad

Them niggas hating on your boy
Bow, bow, gruow, gruow
We got body parts
Young rich nigga tryna see a milli
I got niggas that'll get you for a meal ticket

I feel like the president, Richard Nixon
Gruow, gruow, gruow we got body parts
Call me Pastor Takeoff, healing niggas Peter Popoff
I'm A1 nigga no steak sauce
Baking the birdies, I'm having a bake-off

A living legend, Ronald McDonald
My wrist terminator, but I am no Arnold
Football Xans, I call 'em Hey Arnold
Yo' bitch wanna fuck the squad
Cause she see exotic cars
Young rich nigga tryna see a milli
I know niggas that remix, re-rock the whole chicken
I feel like the president, Richard Nixon
Fuck nigga talking hit 'em with extensions
Throw 'em in the river now the nigga missing
Fuck nigga tripping, not payin' attention
I hit 'em with semis he don't even see it
Clear the whole scene and I'm leaving no witnesses
The only people that I spare is the children
Dissecting you niggas, take away your body parts
Karate chop that nigga like it's martial-arts
Put the pussy nigga on a milk carton
Don't roll the dice nigga, you risk your life
I'm pouring up lean on your grave-site
I throw him the bullet, he catch it like Jerry Rice
Ugh, fuck a bitch cause it's Thug Life
Smoking good cause my plug right
200k sold on my debut release
200 felons locked up from the team
Popping 200 bottles the day they release
Yes, I am deceased, meaning I'm raiding from all of these sheets
Get Rich or Die Tryin' keep that on repeat
And all these bitches is trying to get on me
And I fuck all of them hoes, got 2 cell phones, can't none of them call me
I don’t know what language you're speaking
Every time you see us we get larger and larger
I don’t understand the lingo
Everytime you see us, we get richer and richer
Everytime you see us, we get richer and richer
Everytime we see you, you get broker and broker
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Down on your knees, you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, Brokanese
Talking Brokanese, I take yo' bitch and broke her knees
Brokanese, Brokanese
You’re speaking Brokanese like : Can I have a dollar please?
I'm Hercules, you're Brokales
Extortion we want it, so bring that money back to me
WWE, you boys jabronies, GLAW! GLAW! GLAW!
I come with the chopper feeling like Tony
You niggas is cloning, copy me
Then you look at us, like you ain’t did nothing wrong
You got the nerve to bite the swag, then try to get us on a song
No fuck nigga, we don't rock like that
That's how niggas go broke like that
If you wanna make millions, then join QC independent
Everytime you see us, we get richer and richer
Everytime we see you, you get broker and broker
Everytime you see us, we get richer and richer
Everytime we see you, you get broker and broker
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Down on your knees, you speak Brokanese
"Bon appétit", it’s time to eat
Beat the pot like a nigga boxing bob and weave
A whole thing
I don’t talk your language ‘cause you're talking Brokanese
You broke down to your knees
Hold up freeze
You ain't got no money in your pocket don't talk to me
Whippin' the Anna Nicole and Lindsay
No off-days, everyday payday
My diamonds looking like KK (white)
You broke and asking for favors
Young nigga I got 40 acres
Mansion house so damn big, I don't talk to nobody
I ain't got no neighbors
My neck is cold as a glacier
I fucked her, you should've save her
We're ballin', you're not a player
Front row, courtside at the Lakers
Everytime you see us, we get richer and richer
Everytime we see you, you get broker and broker
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Never play piano but I whip with lots of keys
Trappin' and cappin' the fishes
Talking to my plug, Jackie Chan in Japanese
Private jet to Belize, smoking OG Christmas trees
Ain't got a dollar you're so Brokanese
You need to be stacking that broccoli
I'm mister Miyagi and that's why you copy me
A nigga still on the block
Selling them quarters and mention my niggas been dealing it
I travel overseas, I water whip in The Bahamas
In Australia I'm the crocodile hunter
In Africa in the jungle
Everytime you see us, we get richer and richer
Everytime we see you, you get broker and broker
Everytime you see us, we get richer and richer
Everytime we see you, you get broker and broker
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Down on your knees, you speak Brokanese

Pull up on the block, I had to Forgiato my tires
Came to party with my niggas, they be gettin' it
Came to party with my bitches gettin' freaky
Hit the pussy with the right don't call me rookie
Came to party, came to party, came to party
White girls poppin' molly, running round the lobby
Touchin' on their body, fuckin' everybody
Throwin' money up at Follies, make these bitches swallow
Young Offset got plenty guala
You can come party with the Migos and won't go home til the morning
I came out of jail to about 300 thousand. Gadgets on my whip, I'm lookin' at this mothafucka like how the fuck am I supposed to start this shit, man? (Yeah) Rich Nigga Timeline. (I know you can't believe this shit.) Unbelievable. (We did it.) Nah, forreal
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
You say you didn't see but you can't believe it
When it come to kickin' doors I make you believe
How can I not believe that she with it?
She came in my room, caught me breakin' a safe
Then she asked me, "Boy, Quavo what's really in it?"
They tried to assassinate us like Biggie
What the hell goin' on?
No time to talk, bustin' back with extensions
Who got the iron?
I'm prayin' the Lord the bullet don't hit one of us in the spine
Open your eyes, stand up and bust with the 5
Stand up and bust with the 5
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
They suckin' me like they some leeches
These niggas, they actin' like bitches, they wanna take pictures
They not a rapper on a feature
Wake up in the mornin', I say me a prayer like a preacher
I teach myself like a nigga had a teacher
I got Justin Bieber in my cabin fever
Picasso pretty pictures is Mona Lisa
I can take a trip to Argentina, Indonesia
I don't need a fuckin' visa
I can't believe that we did what we did
But I pray to the man above, nigga we did it
Watch over my brother, I'm my brother's keeper
Dressed in black Margiela, I'm the Grim Reaper
Can you believe that we made a milli off of "Versace" money
Mentions ran off the meter
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Achievers, you niggas just disbelievers
You seen the first chapter, now this the sequel
I'm ahead of you niggas, we not no equal
That's the same nigga that broke in them houses
He ain't have no checks so he sat and accounted
21, I had a Challenger
Monitor had 20 thousand, I couldn't even count
My life start changin', these bitches got frantic
These bitches, they see me, they start to panic
Grandma told me better take advantage
Prayed to the Lord and my prayer got answered
I pulled to the club in a Phantom
'Member when the police bust in, it was random
Give it up!
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Yeah

See this day and age, these young niggas getting paid
Wrist clear, Sprite, yuh

Motocross bike, yuh
We don't fist fight
Chopper real light
Double seal tight
This drank got me right
Piccolo green it's millions, and the old money got mildew
They calling me Bob the Builder
Quavo Paul Pierce em', whip a ball, Wilson
Put my all in that bowl, put my all in it
I want all my dogs to win it
I want all my dogs to win it
Remember my dog was sentenced
No, no, I ain't gon' take it back to the beginning
Just get in the Benz and sit in
(Talk to em'!)
C'mon (Ay!)
(Get in there!)
(Chill!)
(C'mon!)
Standing in the trap, been a long day
Thinking bout putting insurance on my wrist and AK
Now it's no more crying 'cause we upper echelon
I can make a Tuesday, go up like a Saturday
I don't play where you fools play, you must be from out of state
Molly your girl dinner plate, you take her on dinner dates
Dabbing in Raf Simmons, yeah I dress the huncho everyday
Ricki Lake, wrapped up, came from Kuwait
Every day, every day, young nigga looking for bae
Got a bitch on Jimmy and she do whatever huncho say

Quavo
Case closed, we can stop the duckin'
Went and did the show out there in Georgia Southern
Had a couple grams on us, large amounts of cash
We was super late, but they said be early
The other van had Rich and Murk in
Got to the show, 12 deeper than 30
That's when I knew that somebody was workin'
We the only niggas in the back
I had to hand big 12 my fuckin' strap
What I'ma do with my pack?
Damn, I put that shit right in my bag
12 lookin' at us, mad
Cause we thuggin' and our pants sag
While we're pipin' the stage up, doin' the dab dance
12 searchin' the van, damn
They locked up my driver, damn
We walked off the staged
Then walked through the locker room, they was cuffin' our hands
Hold up, ain't no talkin', no discussion
They threw us in the paddy van (paddy!)
Shit, we all said, "Fuck it"
Whatever happen's God's plans
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)

Offset!
Denyin' my bond once again and again
We kept it solid, don't fold and don't bend
Had to beat a nigga tryna steal up out my Benz
My diamonds be kickin' like Ryu and Ken
If I had the chance I would jump the fence
Sat on my box, read a book while I vent
Felt like I lost it, but I got it back
She archin' her back in the back of my hatch
I swear to the Lord that I'm not goin' back
Back on the road, 80 thou', we need that
Takeoff gave a hunnit, told me to relax
Sleepin' one eye open, Silver without a patch (I see you!)
They set us up knowin' we stay with them straps
You not a boss cause it's somethin' you lack
Smokin' on gas, breathin' like Toni Brax
Back to the bando and back to the trap
Got on my knees and asked God to help me
Actin' like I don't know you like I got amnesia
Portraits in my mansion of Mona Lisa
My partners beggin' me just like they Felicia
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)

Muddy trouble on the way to Georgia Southern
Poured me a four and went out of it
Tried to hit a nigga in the head with so many charges
When I got to the show I woke up, didn't know nothin'
All I seen was police, sheriff, and drug enforcers
Took that, zipped up my hoodie then I got the TEC
And I asked for the Ozium cause it was musty (spray!)
But it's too late for all that cause they lookin'
My gat's in my britches, I keep smellin' cookies
No this ain't a wrap, but I smell what they cookin'
When I was on stage, I didn't have a feelin'
That they was behind me plottin', tryna get me
If I knew then what a nigga had seen
Had a zip in my net when I got jammed
Lookin' cause it wasn't no cameras around
Autistic when they come to question on sound
Not talkin' so whatever you know, you found
But you ain't find shit, nigga, I'm not a clown
Searchin' so hard, left some drank in the ground
Fuck all that shit, my nigga's out the slam
Nah forreal, Takeoff!
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)

Big bankroll on fold
Cause you see the niggas skeezin'
England, England
Pounds, pounds on me like the king of England
England, England
Pounds, pounds on me like the king of England
Quavo, Quavo, Quavo
Fuck is you thinkin'?!
My niggas, they keep the extension
Car's not rented
Young nigga, I cash out on Bentleys
I'm watchin' you scraping up pennies
(Pow pow pow) Watchin' you skeezin'
You a fuck nigga and I mean it
Got pounds, king of England
King of England, you niggas rookies
I am a veteran, smokin' on clickers
Yo bitch, she textin', my bitch the queen of England
Elizabith II, my nigga, we're droppin' the pound
The Nino Brown, and he got arrested
I got the molly santana, you take a rock, you jungle [?]
I'm whippin' that dope, no miracle
Hop out that limo, pull out the red carpet
Like 80 Coming To America
Plottin' on me is hysterical
El Chapo Jr
Goin' down, betta ask around
(Foolie you really be trappin'?)
Bitch, I'm makin' it happen
Got pictures outta the condo
Foolie the Prince, makin' a call to my Migos
He pullin' up pronto
Bitches they paying my rent
Migo west 700
Taking a trip and we landing in England
Trappin' alound in London, trappin' on more in London
I throw a skimask when we ain't even skiing
West coast, nigga
Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
You can take what's yours but you gon' leave what's mine
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres
Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed it to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searchin' through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
We was born to mothers who couldn't deal with us
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I had both mine home, let's keep it real, niggas
My better half chose the better path, applaud him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winning
I claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard, that rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a hustler, no graveyards
Much rather burn us, ashes to ashes
Now you celebrate, motherfuckers, raise your glasses
Push...
Trouble world, trouble child
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
I'd rather die, than go home
I'd rather die, than go home
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres
Unpolished, unapologetic
Might have broke a heart or two but gave an honest effort
My nonchalant attitude is always 'F it'
Thirty-five years of marriage and my momma left it
The better question is, did you enjoy the dance with him>
(Yughh!) I'll probably never pull you chair out, bitch
All that shit I bought you wear out
Rich, and I'm the only one I care about
Hate me or love me, only he can judge me
Unpolished, unapologetic
Big willie with the blow, niggas, I am legend
School of hard knock, I attended
Selling hard rock, fuck who I offended
I was a goner, punished by karma
The 911 came with the ass shots
A toothless crackhead was the mascot
The owner of the key to that padlock
I’m Jordan versus Cavs for the last shot
I need all mine, reparations
We growin' poppy seeds on my 40 acres
Push!
Trouble times destroyed my smile
No change of heart, no change of mind
And I ain't leaving without my 40 acres
I let you into my diary to admire me
The make up of this man, I let you see the higher me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug of war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harold Potter
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear them Vegas nights was fucking awesome
But adiós I blow my own dice before I toss 'em
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm motherfucking Gorgeous
WOOOOOO!!
As the gull wing doors lift
Karate Kid, crane kick—no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush that they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they devil red, tires double tread
I post and parks up, that gets me double head
Tight rope walking tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind look at what the devil did
She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Came off fly street money partied nights with the a-list
I write this alone in Vegas
I write this alone in Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fading so
I write this alone in Vegas
They'll do everything in their power
Stomp near the stove when you're rising like flour
Make your cake fall when you threatening their tower
It's 911 you're on your 25th hour
Hasta la vista I'm steppin' out the bleachers
The game can't grow by just followin' the leaders
You gotta be better than the ones who precede, yeah
Upgrade them, upstage them
Change the whole body shape and just update them, Pagans
Reagan era I ran contraband
Money caused turf wars through the promised land
First time being rich could be a common man
The Guy Fishers had the blueprints and diagrams
We just took what we needed and we built on it
Lord forgive me for the blood that I spilt on it
She left the door open gave a fuck if I'm famous
I write this alone in Vegas
Remember nights when my team blew it all on the tables
I write this alone in Vegas
Fear of God niggas, got me feelin' like Pac
This the realest shit I ever wrote
About $14,000 dollars worth in 20s
Brown paper bag money, I call that a good weekend
Re-up gang forever
Malice my brother I love you
Work, hard work (Git!)
Work, hard work (Grrrrrrrah!)

Grrrrrrrrrah!
This G.O.O.D. Music
You're sweet to me, diabetes; peace treaties
Breakfast of champions, they need Wheaties
Carrying the torch, the Olympic four rings
I hear 'em whisper like a hummingbird sings
Of all the trust issues that a hundred birds bring
It's a common running theme: victim or vice lord
Disciple or Black stone, what you look to Christ for
We in the last days, fire or the ice storm
I wear it in my chain as a symbol of a crime lord
Jealousy's a sin, Cain killed Abel
Backstabber, Caesar had Brutus
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
Now I'm on this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Raised 'round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high then suck 'em dry
Before you know it, her Q7 is buzzing by
The queen pin to the king pin redeems him
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
Supreme ballers, all my niggas got ESPYs
Triple doubles, both wrist and neck freeze
They love me on my Ric Flair shit (wooo!)
In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (wooo!)
Who are you to be compared with? (Wooo!)
Ain't no niggas that you bled with
Court cases ran base and road aces
Lick shots or left bodies with no traces
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
My whole team winning, no vision on quitting
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it
Look, my ouija board don't never lie to me
The best rapper living, I know who's alive to me
Raah, I make these motherfuckers hide from me
The Sergio Tacchini life we uphold
You just posing for them pics so you can upload
Yuugh! This the life that we made
Gun shots in the dark like a sweet serenade, nigga
Come on, let's toast the champagne, this one's for the life
Did everything you could to be here for the night
Man, it feels good, everything is right
Energy is strong enough to brighten city lights
I'd rather say I did than let them busters say I didn't
Le-le-let 'em talk about it, mane, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it
Black ambition, not
Lack a vision, lead to
Bad decisions, so
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch your number
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch it up
But the antidote
Might not exactly be in what you smoke
It might just be a letter from a long time ago
From someone you know
Who's been there before
So there you go
On my third strike, I done sinned too
Best coke era, I done lived through
Stuck with a baby, cry a million tears
I done had the realest nigga's bitch
I done seen the realest niggas snitch
Get a job, seen the realest niggas switch
Whisperin', "The dope boy's dead"
Says the credit card, mothafuckas
Black ambition, not
Blacks in prison, no
Lack a vision, lead to
Bad decisions, so
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch your number
Switch it up, lil' hitter
Switch it up
But the antidote
Might not exactly be in what you smoke
From someone you know
Who's been there before
So there you go
Wish death upon they soul until they burnin' in a fire
I'm the illest mothafucka breathin', fuck yo rhyme or yo reason
Fucking over yo issues, it's kill-a-ho-nigga season
I made my way, way, I found my road, road
Bar-arada-da, I made my own, ho
YUGHHH , you ain’t ever have shit local nigga?
Woo, how the fuck I owe you local niggas?
I’m a global nigga, Champs-Élysées shopper
Looked up to Eric B and dope dealer, chain rockers
Where was you when I was bleeding
Disappointed and battling my demons
And I feel…
And I feel like they want to take my life
Be careful what you say, be careful what you do
Tell them what they want to hear, but stay from the truth
And I feel like they want to take my life
It ain’t enough that I struggle through my career
Less appreciated when I was part of a pair
Pushed an envelope full of truth like I was dared
Depiction and the depth was the proof that I was there
It’s no question in my origins
Photo album full of Polaroids they’re still pointing in
Seven different SIM cards, bringing all that mortar in
Brick by brick nigga, all you add is water in
I just want to float through clouds Hermes seams on my towels
No overly gaudy shit, just the diamonds on the dials
Woo, and I’m still buying mo’ guns
Mo’ money, mo’ murder nigga, choose one
Be careful what you say, be careful what you do
Tell them what they want to hear, but stay from the truth
And I feel like they want to take my life
Drug dealer Benzes with gold diggers in 'em
In elevator condos, on everything I love
This ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades
This lifestyle's forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made 'em wait
What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and he's great?
Oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
Just add water, stir it like a shake
Play amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes
This is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days
And baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches
They try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches
No jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder
And we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours
We can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold
My numbers lookin' like a bank code
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes
With Ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options
Caviar facials remove the toxins
Who grew up on legends from outer Yonkers
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya
Who said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers
The only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
Might buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out
The message in this music, all my niggas had to live out
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes, yah!
Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Chop the tops off the coupes
The cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho
The Spider joint
And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
Watch the body drop
Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive
The M's count different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
I'll start it at the home front, "I'm On One"
Dennis Graham stay off the 'Gram, bitch, I'm on one
Your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake
How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancée
Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better as your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run; that's real
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh!
I'm selfish, I want all of the curses
If we all go to Hell, it'll be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
OVO 40, hunched over like he 80—tick, tick, tick
How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick
Surgical summer with it—snip, snip, snip
And you don't really want it with him
We gon' take this slow
We just gon' peel it back layer-by-layer
Album of the motherfuckin' year
And you talkin' 'bout you upset
Hahahahaha
You show me that
Razor
The devil is a lie
You ain't broke bread 'till you taste the devil's pie
They say his laugh sounds like an angel when he cries
What better camouflage when the halo's your disguise
Them wings don't fly; your traitor is your neighbor
Bathrobe on, but the sword's underneath
And he wanna see your blood as it pours in the street
It's the mark of the beast
The meek shall inherit the Earth; the weak shall inherit the dirt
You each should have perished at birth, stillborn or aborted
Every street tax gotta come with an audit
Either your life, or your loved ones, straight razor or a snub-gun
From the village where the thugs from
Same corner that you copping all your drugs from
He a hero, but he unsung, I'm the one
Now make a move, these guns whistle, sizzle up dudes
Who got big mouths, no power
We better than the rest of 'em, my guess is the estrogen
And all the money we got, we move like the Mexicans
Yeah, the coke is fresh, straight out of Bermuda yo
Or chilling on a beach in Boca Chica
Passing of the balances of bread to the Island since
1984, the blow was just more
Then we would come trough with rifles rockin Nike boots and war
A real nigga's invention that came from a henchman
Who blew up, now throw the Wu up, that's my redemption
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em
Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin
You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this paper
Make a move, you make the papers, lose lose situation
Sweat or blood, you get to choose what you bathe in
The chemists cookwork, the runners; footwork
The custies took work, the soldiers put work in
On any of the motherfuckers who fucked up good work
Bosses tell 'em: 'Good work,' that's just how the hood work
Northface bubble with eight bundles under it
Gold front upper-lip smile while I was hugging it
I lied, I wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, he who I'm fucking with
My moms threw that snow in her nose, but I would hustle it
Champ hoodie, Mongoose with the pegs
Clap your stoop up, hit moms duke in her legs
That's beef nigga, y'all ain't street niggas
Fucking everything, neck heavy swing
In that Nissan, Honda, Chevy thing peddling
Whatever bring 'fetti in, steadily I fed my whole team
Drug dealer, been that nigga half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen 'em
Imagine being first name basis with the kingpin
In this art of war, my pen stroke is Picasso
Niggas get the picture I ain't got to paint the nostrils
You know my origins is over when
Fat black bitches singing over organs
Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow
Yuugh! That's the price you gotta pay for it
All's fair in love and war, she masquerade for it
Woo! Jack-O-Lantern Push
Trick or treat, fuck your shit, I earned it off the books
Now listen to me vent
When you sitting watch, it's like the tires being spent
Shots from everywhere, but they never make a dent
Knight in shining armor
Mistake me for the villain cause my vengeance is your karma
Yeah, fear is knowing you're a goner
This music to my soul, cause it's death before dishonor
Gone
Check! Got the tongue of a pimp, raised by a dirty preacher
That used the church money to cop a new Beamer
Got the heart of a child raised by a prostitute
That bought his momma the rubbers when a John came through
It’s the microphone methadone, greatest ever etched in stone
You ain’t getting pussy like your prom date had a chaperone
Popping pills got a nigga brain like a labyrinth
Called the ho on purpose but I got the brain on accident
Nigga I’m your majesty, show up with a bag of weed
My manuscript leave a man ripped of all his dreams
The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens
I’m a wet dream, dry sense of humor
Travel in class like a high school rumor
No one really cares if you embarrass us with style
Cause when it comes to them raps you been letting us down
So tell em why you're mad son
Gotta get it off your chest, let em know how you feel son
You gotta say what you say
It don’t matter, they gonna say a nigga hating anyway
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up out my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m ’bout to cop the Porsche
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Started with 28 grams and a hammer
They forgot the third, I’m on top, antenna
Winter time, bags at the mall, bad Santa
Fifths plaza, Lennox Square Mall, Atlanta
Twinkle toe, Louboutins, hoes love glamour
Black and white diamonds in the chain, that’s panda
Good Music calendar, Def Jam planner
Now everybody fans and the feds got cameras
Off white top on the coup like dandruff
Turn them k’s over white girls, that's Vanna
Sell him 10, front another 10, That’s standard
He asked to get fronted 20 more. That’s random
See the signs, cut the nigga short, That’s cancer
Kill him then kiss his mama﻿ cheek, That’s manners
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Check up out my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m ’bout to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
I'ma need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Can you just touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit do something, do something
Please, pretty please
Or maybe you could touch it, see where it leads
Go 'head, just beat it like you was Billy Jean
That coconut Ciroc, see that's all we really need
I hoping you can polish like Pledge what I need
I'm moving too fast, cause just when I believe
You came to shut it down like Drake and the Dream
How to kiss it like she standing under miseltoe
My love game got you feeling so official though
I let you referee, just let your whistle blow
I'm never out of bounds, I'm on a higher ground
The Commes Des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin
The J Brand jeans look like you drew 'em on
Once I get the mood right, maybe you should try it
Alas, I'm past on my past
I ran like the flash and I saved the best for last
See we can take it slow, or we can take it there
I'm thinking lap dance and you should take a chair
You see this back and forth, for me it's kinda rare
Let your hair down, I don’t have you pegged as a square
Just let loose as you ride in that ruthless
And the buck hair's waving in the wind
You are such a champ how you take it on the chin
What do you want fucko? You want something?
L swear on my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead
Don't shoot
All I see is
Black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that devil's angel up they noses
Never let jail turn my shine into Moses
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the chauffeur
Kilian loafers
Photo op is priceless, frame my wanted posters
War brings casualty
Bitch have my son before I face that tragedy
I ordered hits, She orders Mahi
R-I-P Vivian [?]
Shoutout to [?]
I wanna talk to all you addicts out there
That's got yourself a great big Jones
An' you done tried all the methadone
An' you just can't leave that heroin alone
I wonder, have you tried
Dope just touched down, I'm so grateful
Numbers so low, bitch, be thankful
They say don't let money change you
That's how we know money ain't you
Bitch, I been had, bitches been bad
We buy big boats, bitch, I'm Sinbad
All my dopeboys, we like kinfolk
BMore burnt spoon, DC glass pipe
VA sent bales, 'bout that trap life
Rapped on classics, I been brilliant
Now we blend in, we chameleons, ahh!
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darlin' to set me free
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I can't—
Who else got the luxury to drop when he want
'Cause nobody else can fuck with me? What a show-off
Nigga, wrist for wrist—let's have a glow-off
Fuck it, brick for brick—let's have a blow-off
If we go by connections made
I can still climb ladders when complexions fade (Yugh)
White on white, that's the Testa
Black on black, that's the Tesla
See these diamonds in this watch face?
They don't miss you 'till you gone with the wind
And they tired of dancin' like a Ying Yang Twin
You can't have the Yin without the Yang, my friend
Real niggas bring balance to the game I'm in (Yugh!)
Can't escape the scale if I tried, interstate trafficking's alive
I need you darlin' to set me free
Come back, baby, try me one more time
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I can't—
Still fresh off the boat, niggas
Don't make me super-soak niggas
Your life ends up a quote, nigga
It's really just momma's fallin' out on the reverend
I play musical chairs with these squares
Rich flair before they was Ric Flair's
Cocaine concierge, longest runnin' trapper of the year
Stood the test of time like Dapper Dan
Season my sauce like Zatarain's
Is he still in the caravan? (No)
Richard Mille on a leather band (Whoo)
Behind the wheel like an ambulance (Go)
On my way up to Maryland (Gone)
Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
Come back, baby, try me one more time
Ooh, baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I can't—
Come back, baby, try me one more time
It's the blackout, 'Rari got the back out
Showing my black ass, engine in the glass house
Started in the crack house, Obama went the back route
Kill bin Laden, 'nother four up in the black house
Still trick with bitches, out with money or with ass shots
GOOD had room for one more, I took the last spot
Whole 'nother level, then you add fame
That's a whole 'nother devil, legit drug dealer
That's a whole 'nother bezel, the carbon Audemar
That's a whole 'nother metal, but still keep it ghetto
Behind the scenes, pull strings like Gepetto
The gun blow steam, whistle like a tea kettle
Runnin' like the rebels, UNLV
Sport shoe on a pedal, I let you niggas settle (yeugh!)
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
Pharrell said "get 'em", so I got 'em
Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot 'em
Then it ricocheted and killed the game, I'm a problem
'Cause I wanna fuck the world but not a fan of using condoms
Pardon my French, I'm going hard as my dick
When I envision my tip on the crust of bitch lips
Mr. Lipschitz has been trippin'
Since I mentioned Reptar triceratops dinosaur dick
I feel it in my gut to kill these muthafucks
Is a must, like the arm of my pits
You niggas coming shorter than a Bushwick Billy costume
Um, well, not really, it's getting kinda chilly
Soaked, getting jiggy with it in Bel-Air's richest
With a bag of pills, couple berries and a biscuit
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
I'm a fucking walking paradox
And a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks
Ironed pair of dockers, two Glocks cocked screamin', "West side!"
With the speakers blastin' a pair of Pacs
Yonkers 10 milli, you're silly
Thinkin' that this 'preme wasn't free, willy
The feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful
And fuckin' tighter than Chad Hugo's pupils, it's Wolf Gang and the
With the Re-Up's a helluva buzz
Rick James said cocaine's a helluva drug
Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
And paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?
This is for the critics, who doubted the chemistry
Two different worlds, same symmetry
And this black art, see the wizardry when you at the top
Of your game, you make enemies, you'll never finish me
Trouble on my mind
I got trouble on my mind
Trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
Ay unno
Me? Me get every bloodclot ting
Ah him ah mind me, ah him bring di money come gimmie
Yuh no see mi titty dem how dem stiff an tun up? Ah him buy dem gimmie
Yuh no see mi big house wid car an land? Ah him buy it gimmie
So tell me, weh would I want wid unno skettle bald people mon?
Nuttin
These women ain't shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl, you different
When you're not around, it feels like something's missing
Never tell no lie
Know you heard what they say
True love is hard to find
I just might trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
Just might trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Might just trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money, girl
Who'd have thought I would've fucked with ya
Years later, we in the villa suites
Reminiscing about my episodes
With them extra hoes, but you didn't cheat
Cold nights when you couldn't sleep
Celine bags were the given treat
C-Class helped you see past
Whoo! I'm good money
It's all good that she the top bitch
But she just wanna know the bottom line
Phillip Lim, Derek Lam
Every baller gotta know she's sponsored
Whoo! You earned that
We turnt up, we turnt out
We too far gone to ever turn back
When you're not around, it feels like something's missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell no lie
Know you heard what they say
I just might trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
Might trust you with my money
Girl, I'll trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Might just trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money, girl
Locked phones, past tense
Pass time, Presidential
Rolexes, both sexes
Blue bezel we both flexing
Big diamonds, we Bowflexing
Pitch dope, touch down
Both sports, I'm Bo Jackson
Your bitch fronting, that's you
I break it down, then break her off
We everything that they talk about
Them bitches lurking -- your page locked
And they still know when you shopping
You still know that I'm all in
Gon' hate the fact that I'm spoiling
Whoo! But you earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turnt up, we turnt out
We too far gone to ever turn back
These women ain't shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl, you different
When you're not around, it feels like something's missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell no lie
Know you heard what they say
True love is hard to find
I just might trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
Just might trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Might just trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money, girl
Please don't mind
I just need some time
Just gotta make sure you meet all mine
Standing there staring, with your bow-legged stance
Look at you as something more than a ho I could smash
Pole in my pants standing at attention
When you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling
Glance at the ceiling
Now your glass is empty
Thinking backwards, really
I done grabbed a vixen
That supposed to be a fitter after video
Stacks'll really blow
You remain the same no matter up or down
Money come and they help us spend it
But'll fuck my niggas in the very minute
I was down and out and had to go to prison
Kinda high role play, acki
And again I say I like these hoes
Lyrically I’m, untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
To separate myself from you kings of the YouTube
I am more U2, I am like Bono with the Edge
In Mexico, fuck Donald and his pledge
Legend has it, the wrist is magic
The left is Patek, Philippe's replaced by Matsuhisa
Ignore most requests for the feature
Unless it’s getting played on the beach in Ibiza
While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha
Can’t you see my Total; Pam, Kima, Keisha
I’m aiming for the moguls, why y'all niggas aiming at the locals?
And rap niggas broke like them, they’re mere hopeful
The last one to find out that Baby own the cars
The final trilogy of Jaws
It feels like, still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin’ pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
Yuugh! It’s a different calisthenics when I do the Lennox
Half a million paralleled and ain’t nothin’ rented
Yeah, wearing Dri-Fit in my shit
It rides a little better in the cockpit
Untouchable, uncrushable
Mu told me to switch styles
He just came home from the Feds like a mistrial
He tells me I miss out on all that club money, I don’t bounce
Adidas gave me a million and that don’t bounce
The president of G.O.O.D. Music has been announced
My breakdown game bought me ‘8 Mile’ fame
Selling Eminem to him and ‘em
White to the Blacks I’m a villain in
The Rolls Royce, playing peek-a-boo with the emblem
Let’s talk about it gentlemen
My barcode is Netflix “Narcos”
Part on the side of my 'fro like I’m Pablo
No hablo, I sell blow
Lone wolf, no Tonto, head honcho
Yuugh, let’s take the scenic route
They open the wash bay, I climb it like K2
Of every Spanish name I done ran across
No matter what the weight, I done ran it off
I’m walking on water, I took the sandals off
Tell A&E to turn the cameras off, Push
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
(PIXIE LOTT feat. Pusha T)
Let's go
Yes, we turn heads like an exorcist
These red bottoms on our feet looking devilish
We take it to the next level, so effortless
I'm tired of you kicking the dirt, just want the dust to settle
I'll find just what I deserve, if you can't do better
Can't say that you'll take your time, before the sweet turns sour
Don't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Then I'm like whatever
Bye I'll see ya later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Oh, what do you take me for
Let go cause I'm cutting the rope, I guess you climbed the wrong tower
Don't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
Don't know what you think I'm after
Then I'm like whatever
Bye I'll see ya later
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Two kids in a bucket, f*ck it
The way you handle this
Yeah I'm disgusted
Never been busted, treat me like a suspect
Why am I the one that just can't be trusted
Try harder, discuss it, why bother
I made you, I'll make another and she'll go further
And you can bet a million on it
South of France on a yacht with us chillin' on it
Don't know what you think I'm after
Don't think I can take anymore
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
Then I'm like whatever
Go on right through the front door
What do you take me for, what do you take me for
“It's so hard for me to sit back here in this studio, looking at a guy out here, hollering my name! When last year I spent more money, on spilled liquor, in bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made! You’re talking to the Rolex wearing, diamond ring wearing, kiss stealing, whoa! wheelin' dealin', limousine riding, jet flying son of a gun and I'm having a hard time holding these alligators down!”
Bow your heads as the Lord's mentioned
Prayer service held in the kitchen
I wish they never found Jimmy Henchmen
I’m what dreams are made of
Cocaine Ronald gave us
Then Nancy tried to save us
By that time we had Motorola pagers
Now we push button start motors
Yacht owners, you small ballin', that’s Pop Warner
Menage a trois in the bath house
Blew money on ‘em, bitches never bad mouth
You glass slipper bad whores, I just cash out
You open doors, I open jaws and pass out
Luxury is just my lifestyle
I’m Scott free with a million dollar bright smile
You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
I'm what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I’d rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can’t deny it baby
I'm what dreams are made of
Yeah, Louboutins under sweats
A hundred just landed from responding to a text
Niggas talk money but I’m still unimpressed
When these thousand dollar sneakers got me feeling underdressed
Hip Hop bores me, hustlers applaud me
Too much school boy, not enough rude boy
And it ain't even half of my safe, tuck like the Jew boy
Bentley with the rag-top yarmulke
It says kilometers all on my speedometer
Cocaine under my tongue like thermometer
I got the fever, I never took a breather
Need a way out like Nas needed an Ether
Like Mike Vick chased by PETA
More pony hairs, more zebras
More pythons, more lizards
You niggas gettin' money, I never hear about it
I’m what dreams are made of
Sell that pussy to me, I’d rather buy it baby
Look at ya purse you need the help, you can’t deny it baby
I’m what dreams are made of
Niggas talkin' shit, Push—how do you respond?
Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ (GQ)
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?" (we do)
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' "Makaveli" (come with me)
Two sides to every coin so we bail ready (bail ready)
How do you respond?
I let the monies and the fools talk
I let the jewels and the hues talk
Chanel's on ya bitch
The coupe is 320, the roof's hit or miss
See, I did it my way, the proof's in the bricks
Eghck! Smell it through the Tupperware (Tupperware)
Two can get you four like a double dare (woo!)
I'm the king of the oven-ware (oven-ware)
You can piece the whole puzzle here
Niggas talkin' shit, 'Ye—how do you respond?
Poop, scoop!
Whoop! Whoopty-whoop!
Am I too complex for ComplexCon?
Everything Ye say cause a new debate
"You see, he been out of touch, he cannot relate
His hallway too long, bitch too bad
I be thinkin', "What would 2Pac do?"
You be thinkin' what New Kids on the Block do
If you ain't drivin' while Black, do they stop you?
Will MAGA hats let me slide like a drive-thru?
That phone call from Ricky still hazy
When heaven got an angel named Avery
You gotta watch who you callin' crazy
Yeezy, the newest billion-dollar baby
It won't feel right 'til I feel like Phil Knight
Goin' for six rings like what Phil told Mike
No more hidin' the scars, I show 'em like Seal, right?
How do you respond?
Niggas talkin' shit, Push—how do you respond?
I'm top five and all of them Dylan
I am the hope, the dope dealers won
Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?"
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' "Makaveli" (come with me)
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin so we bail ready
How do you respond?
I let the monies and the fools talk
I let the jewels and the hues talk
Watch face came with a fuse box
Chanel's on ya bitch
The coupe is 320, the roof's hit or miss
Murder on the highway, the news is at six
See, I did it my way, the proof's in the bricks
Eghck! Smell it through the Tupperware (Tupperware)
Two can get you four like a double dare (woo!)
I'm the king of the oven-ware (oven-ware)
Niggas talkin' shit, 'Ye—how do you respond?
I'm too complex for ComplexCon
You heard Cole on that song, he was tryna' hate
"Hallway too long, bitch too bad"
Got a surrogate," my kid "gets two dads"
How can one man take a company down?
I can see Nike contemplatin' that
"Like bro, we're fucked, what's the best plan?
I don't know, hire Ye's best man
Maybe sign Travis, sign Don C
Maybe get the [?]"
Ricky came by unattended
Sent Donda out in heaven, up with Avery
I be thinkin', "What would 2Pac do?"
You be thinkin' "What New Kids on the Block do?"
Drizzy wearin' Yeezys on the low though
The company growin' faster than Flo-Jo
And we did it with no logo
It don't feel right 'til I feel like Phil Knight
Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am
Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
They said be all you can be, nigga
They said be all you can be
Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Knee-deep in this dope money
Damn near where my world ends
Same block, same rock
I was thinking 'bout murdering
Let you worry 'bout serving 'em
Yaagh! They said be all you can be, nigga
I just wanna buy another Rollie
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am
Pour it on you, hallelujah, pour it on you, hallelujah
Even if it's leftovers, I still gotta eat, right?
Got gas in my peace pipe, pink Sprite
She P-popping her jeans tight
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Look out the window, got a bad bitch in my swimming pool
Pretty girls is my reputation
Getting to it, no hesitation
To fuck with me you need a reservation
Good music legislation, delegatin'
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation
And I'm going 'til I K.O., eyes closed, I'm OK
All my bitches know they roll, even when we role-play
My homie got that nine on him
All night and all day and all night and all day
And all night like that shit's his motherfuckin' soulmate
'Cause no time for hand to hand
When you got this paper hand in her hand
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy, nigga, na-na, na-na, na
Bitch, I'm feeling like a grown ass lil' boy
'Cause I still love to get pampered
But don't get it twisted, watch your step and fuckin' manners
They said the truth set you free!
Woooh! They said be all you can be
Woooh! They said be all you can be
I just wanna pop another band
I just wanna sell dope forever
I just wanna be who I am
Woooh! I just wanna be who I am Woooh!
Woooh! I just wanna be who I am Woooh!
Always knew I could rule the world
Let's define what my world is
Damn near where my world ends
Uh, ah, fuck it, we all poor
Why am I buyin' Rollies? I got 20 for sure
Still connect witchu, it's still hid in the drawer
You see they gave us crack, then started wagin' a war
Uh, all these lies, they steady tellin' me
Before Obama, we had Eric B. (Woo)
Or Tony Lewis out in D.C.
The '80s kingpins, gotta free them
All these faces, they ain't believe in
When love is gone, you hold onto anything
Some do wrong, just to feel anything
But when the void is filled, you stand up to anything
When love is real, you can do anything
(You can do anything)
Uh, I do it for my big Benz drivers (Drivers)
For my street-corner survivors (Survivors)
For my niggas that miss The Wire (Woo)
And throwback mamis, that won't retire
Reminiscin' on the days
When the trips was Cancún and the bottles got sprayed
Y’all was breakin' into cars, we was breakin' bad
When y’all was fightin' dogs, we was racin' Jags
Ain't no future, ain't no past, we won't worry 'bout the crash, uh
Now it's jail poses and club pictures
Airbrush backdrops and jail visits
This the dope boy song for the dope boys gone
Let 'em know it's still snowin'
When love's withdrawn, you hold onto anything
(You hold onto anything)
Some do wrong, they have to do anything
But when the void is filled, you stand up to anything
When love is real (When love is real)
You can do anything (You can do anything)
I'm speakin' to the soul of my black native bros
Who ain't have a silver spoon or a bankroll
Who weren't taught the golden rule, but they made do?
Free lunches and apple juices, uh
Food stamps, ashamed to use 'em
You ever lived with the user?
Shared a bed with abusers, that's the worst way to lose 'em
New plan, but it's a new day
Black people past their due date
Settin' the captives free in a new way
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
It's a new day, black people past their due date
Settin' the captives free, in a new way
Said it's not over, it's not over
Yes, it's just started, it's just started
When love is strong, you can do anything
Things go wrong, but you'll stand up to anything
'Cause when the void is filled, you can do anything
I went ahead and asked God for forgiveness
So now I’m just asking you to listen
I’m living in a World, where my truth can be my lynching
Last words “fuck you all” feel the ropes tension
I’ll never compromise, in it 'til the powder dries
Best friends drowned in quick sand and help you cowards rise
I floss in their honor, there legacy’s in bottles
We was all fucking Shawna, you and E was fucking on her
I was jealous when you both said her mouth was like piranha
Yeah, spend money like we print money
Buck fifty on the car, that's little Dent money
The AC is forever broke, that's vent money
Cocaine snowballed from gambling my rent money
Everyday struggle get money, get the crown for
Say you telling on me, told them folks bout me
All this coke round me like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Cook it down everytime I come around
I just bought the house, put the pent on it
No rent couple hundred K spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Got me loooking at the crown from a birdseye view
Now I’m standing at the top from the words I drew
Rap shit’ll drive you crazy, it done drove Shyne Jew
Mazel tov, now I’m hotter than a Molotov
Tell Lyor I need a million for my monologues
A small price for my cocaine catalogue
Scalp the coupe like a tomahawk
Travelodge stories, I pray that you ignore me
If you can’t feel the joy off a hustler in his glory
Hiding money in a wall from the first to third story
ATL, Glenridge, condo’s true story
A man of everything that I say I am
A little better than the fans, hope and pray I am
Weed the jokers out the deck and just play my hand
Smokers getting stuck and going nuts like it’s Peter Pan
All this coke round me like it floats round me
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
I just bought the house, put the pent on it
No rent couple hundred K spent on it
Cook it down, cook it down, you know that I cook it down
Yeah
Uh-huh
Beautiful evils
Check me out
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
My young niggas sic' ‘em

Your man crush Mondays be owin’ niggas
My skin is triple black, I’m the omen
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Rappers is victimized at an all-time high
But not I, you pop niggas thought I let it fly
I’m Yasiel Puig, I’m in another league
I defected, only thing we have in common, niggas bleed
In ya thousand dollar joggers as you rhyme about ya dollars
Is there shame when a platinum rapper’s mother lives in squalor?
Mildred’s in the Bahamas for the month
She’s probably sitting in her pajamas having lunch
Banana clips for all you Curious Georges
Old niggas slapping young niggas
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is death by the masses
The only asterisk is the change of address
My infinity pool as long as Magic’s
Yeah I let Zillow change my pillows
The home is so inviting, the Porsche is the armadillo
The silhouette
The pop, pop, pop; the chop, chop, chop
The throwaway TEC's got Tourettes 
It’s more than this drug money, I love money
I speak to your soul and that’s above money
The church of criminology, teaching my chemistries
Woo I’m the L. Ron Hubbard of the cupboard
To some certain motherfuckers gotta love it
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
Crutches, crosses, caskets
All I see is victims
Real ballers, they love it
Rollie faces, they flood it
This diamond life is like dynamite
Explosive and it's cold blooded
My handles can't be trusted
No splash brothers, I slash brothers
Shower Posse like Dudus
See I got a thousand cousins
I was focused when y'all wasn't
While y'all was out there clubbin'
I ran suicides in the dungeon
No plain kicks in my Dame 6
I showed them all who they wasn't
Money on my mind
That's the scoreboard
(Money on my mind
That's the scoreboard)
That's the scoreboard
(Money on my mind
CHING!
The closer
Shake your head off your shoulders
And ankle break his opponents
Cross you up, hocus pocus
This Oakland kid is a soldier
They said it's no one that's colder
They say is heart is like polar
'Cause he will hit the game winner
Bye, bye, it was nice to know ya
Adidas (Watch this, watch this, yeah)
Dame 6 (I've been ballin', yeah)
King Push
Watch this, watch this, yeah

This shit I wrote quick
Shit I hate
Broke niggas, that always got something to say
Renegades
I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, ohh
The gods don't mingle with the mortals
Peasants ain't sittin' with the kings
Goliath ain't worried 'bout your sling
And Cassius ain't bothered by your swings
You niggas keep rappin' 'bout your dreams, my reality
50 birds waitin' in the wings
So when Kanye go on his hia', it don't matter
Since you talking 'bout me, then let's talk about this money
Let's talk about the cars and why mines shaped funny
Lets' talk about the fact you'll never take nothin' from me
Lets talk about the fact you niggas hate I'm up and runnin'
Runnin' through this money and these white women
Spike Lee see that
She gotta have it and I gotta give it
And you do not relate cause you niggas do not live it, no
I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, ohh
Attention seekers beware, I will grant wishes
We can take this so much further than your mentions
I can get your eulogy on YouTube for instance
Have the whole world view the body
Since y'all claim I'm Illuminati, tell me why would you try me?
Kennedy, John F., or Bobby
Almost caught Reagan, but they stopped us at the lobby
And that was broad day, so how the fuck you gon' stop me?
You lil' niggas just dirty mine's is Zero Dark Thirty
Mine is night vision, witch huntin', ride for Pac worthy
I'm coke boy leanin' on you niggas
If money talk then I must be screamin' on you niggas
Top of the pile I was two thirds away
I was sidetracked busy selling two birds a day, God
Death is just a U-turn away
Two men ten paces then you turn and spray
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, ohh
I don't give a fuck what you say about me
Give a fuck what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter
It doesn't matter, ohh
My Name is my name!
Re-up gang, G.O.O.D. Music, Def Jam
I love my family
The nerve of you
The lowest form of a thief is a cat burglar
Tiptoe-in' but the whole while cloning
The elephant’s in the room, the bitch glowing
She walk like its her's but the whole world knowing
Told niggas it’s the new god flow
It’s that New Testament and the old God knows
I’ll monopolize Boardwalk Empire flow
So don’t mention me in the same breath, I’m Genghis
Just venting I never wished to be famous
Truth told I’d much rather be strangers
Before it leads to me turnin’ niggas to angels
Local niggas hatin’ but I can’t blame ‘em
Put Trey up on your hook, still couldn’t save ‘em
Better chance with a snowball hitting Satan
Dreams money can buy, three racks just spent on my Marty McFly's
Now I’m back to the future, my career deja-vu you
When you muthafuckers thought I would hardly survive
Don't fuck with me
You see
There's a lot of people out there to be fucked with
I am not one
Re-Up Gang
Don't fuck with me
Rappers on their sophomores, actin' like they boss lords
Fame such a funny thing for sure
When niggas start believing all them encores
I’m just the one to send you off, bonjour
See yourself as I pull up in that mirror tint
Sketch comedy, who was for real pennin'?
The talk don’t match the leather
And wolves don’t walk with shepherds
These Margiela verses all you mall dwellers
Off-the-rack suits looking like pallbearers
Coffins for my old bitches’ orphans
Daddy’s MIA like a dolphin
Play the Fendi bucket like a shark's fin
Cool J-ing on you bitches but I’m dark-skinned
We walked in, seats courtside
Dap Diddy, Will Ferrell on my walk by
At the US Open, there’s much more to Queens
Versace blu-blockers, row behind Oracene
Dreams money can buy
Push..no shots...but nothing goes unseen
The nerve of you, he'll sit and clip at your lines
Like he ain't heard of you
I seen it happen before, that man will murder you
The lowest form of a thief is a cat burglar
The elephant's in the room, the b*tch glowin'
Like a ghetto girl with the good weave sewn-in
Told n*ggas it's the new god flow
It's that new testament and that old god knows
And you new n*ggas don't get to pass GO
I'll monopolize boardwalk empire flow
So don't mention me in the same breath, I'm Genghis
Truth told I'd much rather be strangers
Before it leads to me turnin' n*ggas to angels
Local n*ggas hatin' but I can't blame 'em
Cleared the road to the riches but I can't pave 'em
Better chance with a snowball hittin' Satan
Dreams money can buy, three racks just spent on my Marty McFlys
Now I'm back to the future, my career deja-vu you
When you muthaf*ckers thought I would barely survive
Rappers on their sophomores, actin' like they boss lords
Fame's such a funny thing for sure
When n*ggas start believing all those encores
See yourself as I pull up in that mirror tint
Chappelle Show, all of your Neal Brennans
Sketch comedy, who is for real penning?
The swag don't match the sweaters
And wolves don't walk with shepherds
Off-the-rack suits looking like pallbearers
Daddy's MIA like a dolphin
Cool J-ing on you b*tches but I'm dark-skinned
We walked in, seats courtside, dap Diddy, Will Ferrell on my walk by
At the US Open, there's much more to Queens
Versace blu-blockers, row behind Oracene
Dreams money can buy, three racks just spent on my Marty McFlys
Now I'm back to the future, my career deja-vu you
When you muthaf*ckers thought I would hardly survive
Push, no shots, but nothing goes unseen
In the midst of negativity
A positive sight can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good
Seems to let evil occur
While still possessing our human form
We live life searching for greatness since the day we was born
Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking for
Forgiveness for our sinful ways
With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray
Amen
Yeah (amen) you like that right? (amen)
I wrote it myself by the way (amen)
Fuck the goddamn shit (amen)
You gotta get it in, bruh, let's get it (amen)
You like that, don’t ya? I wrote it myself, by the way
And I don’t mean to be selfish, but I picture myself gettin' paid
And you might catch pneumonia, 'cause I'm colder than a elf on a sleigh
Uh, me and Pusha back on it, now everybody help us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Tryna get saved? (Too late!) time to get paid
Got a gun and a stockin' mask, niggas thought I was tryna get waves
I’ma let all y'all niggas pray for it, my young niggas knockin' off a K for it
Sold my soul on the back end, only fuckin' way I’ma pay for it
Front that shit you put a flame on, my niggas locked in a cage for
They keep tellin' me to go hard, number one spot you was made for
Yuugh! I made more, front of the grill, got a racehorse
California Crayola red, "Glow In The Dark" like a Ye tour
Fuck niggas steppin' in my lane for, not knowin' that it’s a landmine?
Soon as a nigga feel a cool breeze, throw the top up like a gang sign
Red or blue, Crip or Blood, solitaires, diamond studs
Like chandeliers, I’ma flood, black Jesus piece like it’s dipped in mud
Fashion gods, notice mine, rollerball spikes, I’m Pokémon
Paris shit, Louboutin, under bright lights, where do you belong?
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starvin', ayy, 'cause they can’t find no yay
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
Amen
Amen, how many people do you know hatin’
When you shine, I don't know what they gon' say then
Everything I do now stadiums
And I’m headed straight to the ATM
Finna go HAM, nigga finna go in
Nigga you'll get it when pigs fly
When Yeezy fake, Devil’s pie
Piece of cake, Kit-Kat
I need a break, God’s child
Jesus Christ, club like a broken neck
In Egypt they fightin’ for freedom
Cop pull you over, no reason, beat 'em
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starvin', ayy, 'cause they can’t find no yay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen
I got them units packed in that black van like the A-Team
Even seen 'em come 2-tone like a Saleen (Saleen?)
Break ‘em down in the night, that's what I call hustlin'
Condo on the timepiece, yeah, now that's ignorant
They like, "Young, you a fool", yeah I coulda bought some real estate
Instead I bought a half a block and tried to sew up half the streets
I’m on 75-75, when they was going for the 25
Guess who’s pickin’ up a trey? Just an ordinary day
With extraordinary pay, extraordinary risk
Can’t even explain, got an extraordinary wrist
I talk it 'cause I lived it' man, this shit ain't really nothin' to me
Tell ya like Sosa told Tony, “Don't you fuck with me”
Please Lord, yeah, it’s gettin' realer everyday
Niggas killin’, niggas starvin', ayy, 'cause they can’t find no yay
See the first they roll around and their bills they cannot pay
So some be trappin', some be dyin', bow our heads and let us pray
Amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Valentino summers and wave runners
My brick talk is more than obvious, it’s ominous
Garages, the phantom, ghouls, ghosts and goblins
Blonde mohawk the collection I’m Dennis Rodman
The money count is the only moment of silence
Cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
After all I can make a call
I can baptize a brick
America’s nightmare's in Flint
Children of a lesser God when your melanin’s got a tint
And I can’t even mention what I sent or what I spent
'Cause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence
I put my boos in those cruise collections
Paid in full like ’86, Gs on my body
The new Gucci has less monograms, God’s got him
Let he without sin cast the first stone
So I built that all glass quad level first home
Shatter all of your misconceptions
Hold all of them missing weapons
The ultimate misdirection ya
Your husband was a drug dealer
For 14 years he sold crack cocaine
Federico Fellini in the flesh
Sergio Tacchini inside his mesh
Google me baby, you crazy
’89 in London pull the Benz up
Type it in, Google’s your friend bruh
14-year drug dealer and still counting
He been hula hooping through loop holes, working around shit
Thanks to the lawyers
I marbled the foyer
I tore the floor up
Yeah, that’s for the Koi fish
We been dining on oysters
I walk though the garage it’s like multiple choices
I told ‘em pull the Royce up
I’m getting ghost, I’m hearing noises
I think it’s the boys, but I been banking at Deutsche
We been opening studios and 40/40s up
The paper trail is gorgeous
Cases we buries ‘em
Before Reasonable Doubt dropped, the jury hung
Every time I come around your city bling bling
My tenure took me through Virginia
Ask Teddy Riley ‘bout me
Ask the Federalis ‘bout me
Tried to build a cell around me
Snatched my nigga Emory up
Tried to get him to tell about me
He told 12, “Gimme 12”
He told them to go to hell about me
Drug dealers anonymous
Y’all think Uber’s the future, our cars been autonomous
We just call the shots by simply moving our thumbs
Nothing real can be threatened, nothing unreal exists
Therein lies the piece of God
I always knew I was a prophet, but I couldn’t find a decent job
Daaaaaaaamn Daniel
FBI keep bringing them all white vans through
Better know who you is
When you lookin' in the mirror
I'm gettin' low from the hater
Ridin' with my niggas
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Just another day getting by, by, by
For every known rat, it's one slept on
For every loyal nigga fronted, one kept owin'
So let's blow through this money as we pour bottles
Let me drop another classic and a tour follows
Let's get pissy drunk and let the whores swallow
My niggas embrace guns and ignore Bibles
Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lines
The new jury can be you, ghetto law-abiding
Better know who that is looking in the mirror
The truth lies, and your soul can't see it clearer
Better know who you is
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low from the hater
Ridin' with my niggas
I'm gettin' low, hold me from the haters
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'
Rolling smoke, getting high, high, high
Just another day getting by, by, by
I just can't leave it alone, I just can't leave it alone
They're handing out football numbers after tappin' your phone
Or you watchin' for the drop as they clappin' they chrome
Took a brick and I turned it to stone
5 into 10, the Return of the Clones
Then I took my experience and turned it to poems
Panamera blood red symbolize bloodshed
Few still reminiscin' in they CL
Selling Pete Rock, cruisin' in they V-12
When you lookin' in the mirror
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
I'm gettin' low from the hater
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's happenin'
Ridin' with my niggas
Cause everything that glitters, it ain't gold
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's happenin'
Just another day getting by, by, by
Ha ha ha ha ha
Beef is best served like steak: well done
Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids, have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin' them triggers, fuck niggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Taking half of everything you get
Yeah them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
And we know that
Contract all fucked up
I guess that means you all fucked up
You signed to one nigga that signed to another nigga
That's signed to three niggas, now that's bad luck
Damn that shit even the odds now
You better off selling this hard now
You call it living out your dreams
You can't fly without your wings
You get it
Jeremy Scott's all camouflaged
You can't hide it from yourselves, career sabotaged
I was really in that Travelodge
You just lying through your catalogues
Where the blood and the battle scars
Put me to the body, nigga
First 48 put us to them bodies, nigga
Round here we don't play that
A to the K that, spray that, lay back
You can keep your beats, nigga
We'd much rather share your bitch, nigga, bitch nigga
3 million can't hide that
It shows in the homes I done tried that
Fuck you playing games for
They got you talking that big shit
Them niggas using you as a pawn
You see they never loaded they guns
Now you out here all by yourself
Ask Steve Jobs, wealth don't buy health
Beef is best served like steak: well done
Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Move your kids, have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin' them triggers, fuck niggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Heartbroke, yours don't look like ours
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Throwing that flag up running around you hot shit
Taking half of everything you get
Yeah them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
And we know that
What's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, one more time
What's beef? Beef is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Beef is when your moms ain't safe up in the streets
Beef is when I see you
I’m feelin myself, pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I’ma tell them that they can get lost
Cause I’m feelin myself, it’s my world
I’m spending money like a rich white girl
I don’t know about y'all, but I’ma get off, cause I’m feelin myself
Oh, what a feelin, the champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathed in them millions
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling
But I’m downy fresh soft white like my pillow
Feelin myself so if he know like we know
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Under bright lights, middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself
Baby take your chance, never mind what you’re hearing
I can change your life tell me what are you comparing
Put you on the red carpet tell them what you’re wearing
Shop 'til you drop they say sharing is caring
And I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
We so real, got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed, watching Deal or No Deal
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself
I propose a toast to every living kingpin
Smart enough to delegate their work to their wing man
Keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling hand
Play my cards right, now I’m looking at a dream hand
Yeah, got you looking at my poker face
No joker see it, you can call me Smoking Ace
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I’m feelin myself
I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feeling myself
It's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I don't know about you all but I'm a get off
Cause I'm feeling myself
Oh, what a feeling
The champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathing in millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
The driver of that car wasn't made for a ceiling
Still up on my nino
Smelling like a kilo
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Middle finger to you haters
Just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself
I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feeling myself
It's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I don't know about you all but I'm a get off
Cause I'm feeling myself
They say sharing is caring
More than my winnings
Like baby steps
We can share beginnings
Walk before you run but she so independent
And I could see us fly
The sky is the limit
We so real
Got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed
Watching Deal Or No Deal
In a perfect world
Just my guns and my girl
I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feeling myself
I gon' ball like I'm seven feet tall
I don't know about you all but I'm a get off
Cause I'm feeling myself
I propose a toast
To every living kingpin smart enough to delegate their work to their wing
Man, keep a bad bitch on the arm of my bling and play my cards right
Yes, got you looking at my poker face
No joker see it
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I'm feeling myself
I'm feeling myself, pause
I'm more cuff and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
Cause I'm feeling myself, it's my world
They been trying to tie me to the BALCO
Too many clicks in the dial tone
I’m my city’s Willy Falcon
How you niggas celebrating Alpo?
Interior rustic, the mustard-colored wall’s adjusted
Trap doors everywhere
Macs come out the floor, dinners at the Forge
Four Seasons all four seasons
It’s good to have a getaway for no reason
Concierge never speak
I might travel to El Barrio
To get it from Daddy-O then adios
Cellphone at the back patio
I didn’t have to make a cameo to get it off
I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper 
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it’s FIFA
Yuugh! Pops up like dandruff
Beverly Hills Jed Clampett
A shotgun wedding to collect my ransom
Cameo Chris Hansen
I’m at your door
You don’t wanna know him if you owe him
I done boxed in cars and had to tow ‘em
I done laid in lawns when they didn’t mow ‘em
Even hogtied wives, I had to show ‘em
That I mean business
I mean everything I say, no witness
No forgiveness, Souls of Mischief 
It’s on through infinity, my arms are endless
Your arms, too short to box with God
Might send a bitch a Elie Saab
She fucks and robs
10 grand just to touch the job
Close range, she don’t duck and dodge
You can’t trust them odds
It all started on a beeper 
Now they asking for the feature
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
Drug money kicked around like it’s FIFA
I hope you betting on the sleeper
It all started on a beeper 
Till I'm steppin' out the bleachers
I'm feelin myself, Pause!
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feelin myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm go ball like I'm 7 feet tall
Oh, what a feelin, the champagne is spilling
All this dirty money got me bathed in them millions
Came out unscathed from the days of my dealing
Still up on my nino, smelling like a kilo
But I'm down and fresh soft white like my pillow
Cross that line and get shot like a free throw
Rather be on fire at the tables out in Vegas
Under bright lights, middle finger to you haters
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feelin myself
I'm feelin myself, Pause!
One more cup and I might take off
Seems like haters never take a night off
But you know I'm a tell them that they can get lost
Cause I'm feelin myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm go ball like I'm 7 feet tall

Baby take your chance, never mind what you're hearing
I can change your life tell me what are you comparing
Put you on the red carpet tell them what you're wearing
More's in my winnings, we can share opinions, like baby steps
We can share beginnings, walk before you run, but she so independent
We so real, got my own quarter mill
Counting money on the bed, watching Deal no Deal
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feelin myself

Something 'bout my life
Not in the same class
Not on the same flight
Maybe the same club
Just not the same lights
Both fucked the same bitch
Just not the same night
You just took her phone number
I just took her home with her
Another bitch
Ménage
Boomerang
Stron'jay
Lipstick on my collar
Yo hijo - pequeño
Stay sippin' that Andre
Spent 3 stacks - that's Andre
That Balmain
That Phillip Lim
They say i'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Breadwinner
Brand owner
Play Cloths
Millionaire
Hope your bitch don't land on him
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You couch niggas - we stand on him
*#&%#
Dope money with a band on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
DAMN!
I've been on the road
But now I'm back again
I brought my little friend
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
You mean the most to me in this world
I've been thinking to myself a lot
You probably think it's my girls
But when you got the love
It's not like you ain't calling home
And the conclusion I came to is, baby, I am going
Last night, I thought about if this should end
So tonight, I'm hanging with my girlfriends
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Ooh, you should think about what you did wrong
If you love me
Ooh, such a pity I had to write this song
Better luck with your next girlfriend
I should be starting a new life
So tonight, I'm hanging with my girlfriends, we're hanging out
And I'm starting a new life, we're hanging
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight

Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Pusha, I'm finally back at you two years later, hiatus was hell
Eggshell whites, had them boys on my tail
The truth out, now you don't have to question what I sell
Far as the fucking flow, I'm the hottest 'round
Condos, fast cars, that's Miami heat
If you know they just copped Shaq, we got the floor seats
Whachu talkin' 'bout? All that hair and all that wear
BAPE, BBC, Three Dots and all that there
I spent green mayne on that bling chain
Make you scream like the silly nigga from Ying Yang
Green like fist of big Grinch Stole Christmas
Re-up time and it's the work that we bringing out
Hot off the wire, Faith tell 'em whachu thinking 'bout
Last night, I thought about if this should end
I should be starting a new life
So tonight, I'm hanging with my girlfriends, we're hanging out
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
Me and my girls are goin' out tonight
I build it better nigga ten fold
La Ferrari from the Enzo
The stencil inspired by Kenzo
The roof is like Ghostface, can it be so simple
40 keys in a rental
My dogs bring it back, now you name a better kennel
I keep cash, case Feds connect me
Case kids kidnap me, kids can get back me
Not concerned with your rap beef
Poetic justice watching you sock puppets
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
Thou shalt not covet what thou cannot budget 
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
Trap phone, gun at your backbone
Graduated from the corner where the crack’s thrown
Back talk to your momma now you act grown
Listening to Young Dolph till the pack gone
I relate to ‘em
I’m a Pyrex God, shit I’m great to ‘em
All of you lil’ niggas quote all of the wrong figures
Poke all of the wrong bitches
And follow the wrong niggas
Whichever rapper hot at the moment
I gave y’all the game it’s decoded
The only thing left is to grow it
It’s all hustlin’, so deja vu
I’ma dye on that money like a bank got hit sniff
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got my dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
Game too emo, I’m too Nino
Must stay low-key, I play Reno
I’m so Pesci, too Casino 
We Sinatra, Sammy, Dinos
Outlandish, so illegal
So Carlito, so Pacino
We sip vino, the grapes of wrath
Money counter go till it breaks in half
Coupes the flagship, it feels like futon
Palm the paddle shift, abuse the redline
The home is ranch style, reflects the poolside
Powder paved the way, the sword got two sides
Duffle a hundred bands, trunk is 2-5
Mules are flying in, the drive from Tucson
The dash is hollowed out, we shortened the fuel line
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
Fuck it, I got the dope boys covered
The Arizona brick is 26 and they love it
All dem a gwaan dem heart softer than clay
None ah dem have the guts to rise it and spray
None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK
I got dollars on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta
She be proper
Yeah, that's my flocka
All praise to the most high on both sides
I pray to God, I pray for hard, I won't lie
Multi cause I'm dope-tied, convo and a boat ride
Yuugh, my records ain't got to sell, nigga
Woo, go diamond off of my cell, nigga
I ball hard, you bench ride, so fuck you and yo' baseline
No Soundscan for a bricklayer, square nigga, you a brick hater
Where I'm from, we go crazy with them choppas
I got dollars on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta
She be proper
Yeah, that's my flocka
Welcome to my blocka, take a look at my world
Diamond on my blocka, all we got is white girl
All we got is choppas, all you hear is choppas
All we see is choppas, that spotlight on my blocka
Dopeboy to the rescue, bad bitches get the best view
Lotta money just floatin' round, all them hoes feelin' special
Woo, I know the rent due, fuck me right and it's sent through
Third time you done used the line, God damn, she a pimp, too
Teamwork make the dream work, all my niggas done seen work
All my niggas ain't make it through, so much death that my dreams hurt
Where I'm from, we go crazy with them choppas
Sellin' dope, goin' diamond on my blocka
I got dollars on my blocka
Serve it to my flocka
Yeah, that's my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to Lord on my shotta
Never trust a bitch who finds love in a camera
She will fuck you, then turn around and fuck a janitor
Set the parameters
You either with the pro ballers or the amateurs
I won't let you ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the kid
Good mornin', Matt Lauer; can I live?
Look at my new digs
The rooftop can host a paint-and-sip for like 40
The Warhols on my wall paint a war story
Had to find other ways to invest
It's a nightmare, yeah
Still do the Fred Astaire on a brick
Tap-tap, throw the phone if you hear it click
Art Basel-in' the bezel
Your bustdown is bust down and don't match the metal
Lower level's where you settle at
I'm the pot callin' the kettle black
Between God and where the Devil's at
Had to double dutch and double back
Then hopscotch through where the trouble's at
Exactly what the game's been missin'
This fire burns hot as Hell's Kitchen
Push!
Now that's how the ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
Now that's how the ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
From Honda Accords to Grammy awards
That's where the kings go
I can blow a million dollars into dust
Lord knows how many bottles I've done bust
Still runnin' through the models like I'm Puff (M-M-M—)
Confront my problems like I'm Ralo in the bluff
Chillin' in a condo full of ready rock
My homie amputated but gon' stand for somethin'
I'm dyin' to find a way to get a Grammy from it (Maybach Music)
Watchin' my success, for some is bittersweet
Always keep the sharpshooter's triggers tweaked
Diamonds drippin' on me via Tiffany's
All these K-9 units still sniffin' me
Ignorance versus the innocence
It's not the temperature for you in Timberlands
I keep the coldest flows on the hot seat (M-M-M—)
And you can spot my hoes by their car keys
Another episode full of atrocities
It's double M, baby, money monopolies (Maybach Music)
You scared to see my face in a fancy place
So why debate my case vs. a Nancy Grace?
Still hands-on, sucker, press your luck (M-M—)
Your money gone every other month
My money long, so the treasure's tucked
Now that's how the ting go, I'm back from Santo Domingo
'Cause that's where the kings go, down in Santo Domingo
That's where the kings go
EarDrummers
Half a year later, still ain't heard an album greater (yo)
The natives want me out of the office, back on the pavement (yo)
Jokers at the top know the king is nothin' to play with (yo)
9 to 5 money is just as sweet as the grave shift (yo)
El presidenté, Blobama, blow by ya
Chopper next to me in every picture, Osama
Oh mama, they question my starting line up
You only find a diamond from diggin' like coal miners
Don't listen to 'em, Desiigner
Chanel dad hats, but you don't know that they got 'em
So you will never see me as you rotate the mall
Rolls emblem, Black Virginian
Pull in a neighborhood I don't blend in
Album of the year contender every year
The kitchen's full of work, it's blenders everywhere
Blended bitches everywhere that do the most
They never seen with him so they fuck his ghost
Invisible man, timepiece with the invisible hands
MJ, remember the time they counted in sand hourglass
But mine come with purse and heels
And the DIY Gucci with the crest and shields
It's too far gone when the realest ain't real
I walk amongst the clouds so your ceilings ain't real
These niggas Call of Duty cause their killings ain't real
Rap's John Grisham
The bar's been lowered, the well's run dry
They beefin' over melodies, but no, not I (yugh)
See I'm so top 5
If they factor in the truth I just might blow by
Blobama
I sold more dope than I sold records
So I ain’t hearing none of that street shit
'Cause in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Watercolors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win
I was pissing my shorts, having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Overnight I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
If you slip and you fall I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain't hearing none of that street shit
Cause in my mind, you mothafuckas sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I'm a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in his image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Water colors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descendant from kings, we at it again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Over night I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
This track dictates everything I'm supposed to say
So have mercy on this soul that I've thrown away
Although it's cliche the devil had a hold of me
This greedy motherfucker couldn't put the blow away
Bitches blowing kisses and rappers throwing disses
You gonna make me bear these arms like a Chippendale
Squeeze off on him, leave cross on him
By the time the bodies found there's peat moss on him
I could show all you the ways in which crime pays
Two ranch homes, both dockside
The poison in the car is not carbon monoxide
Then beg forgiveness for the same thing he forgave me for
I wasn't crazy poor, see I was lazy more
A thousand kilos cross his lines that you can't ignore
I felt entitled to it, not how the bible do it
My bright eyes exposed to how the hood idols do it
I just took a page, then I took the stage
Then put the face of that Rollie in that diamond cage
I tried to tame the beast, best I could no leash
I stood the test of time, air-tight no leaks
Not a squeak not a peep of a word
I done lived half my life in arms reach of a bird
I could've been six feet or had nurses on me
It was written like these tatted Bible verses on me
I feel the weight upon my shoulders like the church is on me
I am forgiven
You don't do all the shit that I done and make it through and not be forgiven
This is the Wrath of Caine motherfuckers
Let this hold you over
It's just an appetizer
Ha Ha!
Re-Up Gang Forever

'Cause I was busy earnin' stripes like a tiger's skin
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball courts

Gripped every wheel at a Flex car show
I declare war, letting all you rappers know
Checkered flag shit, matching bag shit
Monaco Grand Prix snap back backwards
Don C joint with the python accents
Some shit dont change, ya life ain't like mine
Closed the motorised blinds
Got a seal and a stamp, papi notarized mines
B.O. double S's, that Camaro ain't mine
That Phantom's double breasted
Back when Dame dropped the duffle off with the records
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?
The game's fucked up
Niggas’ beats is bangin', nigga, ya hooks did it
The lyric pennin' equal the Trumps winnin’
The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
Shit, remember Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they ain't even recognize Hov until "Annie"
'Cause I'm ’posed to juggle these flows and nose candy (yugh)
Tom Brady’d you niggas, I had to scramble out
They be ridin' these waves, I pulled my sandals out
Jefe Latin my Grammy, I went the Spanish route
Oh, now it’s okay to kill Baby?
Niggas looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby
Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure
Flash without the fire
Another multi-platinum rapper trapped and can't retire
Niggas get exposed, I see the cracks and I'm the liar?
Now who do you admire?
Them prices ain't real without inflation
I done flew it, I done grew it, been a conduit
Moynat bags on my bitches, I done blew it
See through it, neck, igloo it
Habla en español, I "y tu" it
Let Steven talk streamin' and Shazam numbers
I'll ensure that you gettin' every gram from us
Let's cram numbers, easily
The only rapper sold more dope than me was Eazy-E
How could you ever right these wrongs
When you don't even write your songs?

And you really about that life
Put your keys in the air right now, damn
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Riding in that Lambo, riding in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Oh my God I'm in this ho
Oh my God I'm in this ho
Oh my God I'm, oh my God I'm
Oh my God I'm in this ho
In this ho, I'm in this ho
That Louie and my cologne when I'm riding in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Woah, I'm pulling up in that shit
Four fifty eight on that bitch
Doors lifting up on that shit
Ho, you see the shit on my wrist
Oh my God I'm in this ho, oh my God I'm in this ho
Yeah I'm fucking that centerfold
Fuck you all in my business for
You ain't talking bout getting dough
You ain't talking bout getting more
That's the difference between rich and poor
Recognize I jeopardize that top spot and they testify
They ate first and I'm next in line
We back to back and he pass baton
I put my chest at that finish line
This art money, this Renaissance
My chain heavy, it's winter time
See all colors, this Benetton
Vroom, vroom, I ride around like wheels
Swizz, I'm back up on my shit
Haters, got to suck the dick
I'm riding around in that Countach
Candy paint on that Countach
Rare form, I'm in rare action
Came back I'm like Michael Jackson
Woo! Michael Jackson
Wait a minute, let me slow it down
For you dumb niggas I'll slow it down
I gets the paper you know it now
I gets the paper you know it now
But I'm 'bout to get another one, you little bastards
Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I’m just tryna find my way out this fucking kitchen
Turn one to two now the kilo’s got a sibling
Father knows best, wash my hands all's forgiven
We kicking up dust like the colosseum floors
Walls full of safes like they mausoleum doors
Grants, Jacksons, no room for George
Yeh, the fear of God’s in you muthafuckas
This art imitate my life
Your World Star Hip Hop fame based off imitation white
Eliminate the fool's gold and imitation ice
Every dime I made in this life wasn't disastrous
Help my young bitch see my way through the Bachelors
Sent my old bitch right back to get her Masters
What goes around comes around, this is life's ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel
As I parrallel park, Kentucky Derby on the grill
The fact that I’m free lets me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I’d rather talk fear
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up sipping java
Strolling up the totem poll, what’s my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bear my toddler
So many hands raised as the band plays
I’m here now, watch how many nigga's plans change
First class flights, Ciroc soaked nights
Waking up to models, what a motherfuckin life
Big up di numba one awtist inna di rap game, Pusha T
Me waa unnu kno seh nuhbody nah fuck wid da bwoy yah in or outta music
Di money nah stop run
Nuhbody nuh ave di lyrics, nuh body nuh ave di style or fashion weh him have
Fi him program sort out differnt from unnu
Unnu a rampin business, caa who?
The dead has arisen
My niggas still in prison, though
Til they free, none's forgiven
It's only one mission, it's only one magician
All-Star's in Houston this year, I'm still fishin'
The plug's playground where them hoes play around
Galleria, Mr. Trick Bag when I'm in town
Vengeance is mine, says the Lord
Throwin' shots at niggas cause I'm bored and they whores (Pussy!)
I'mma lean 'til they crown me king of New Orleans
Now everybody so 80's, 90's-inspired
You laptop hot, just internet warm
Down-low for downloads don't get caught up in my storm (Don't do it)
Fuck nigga, you just internet porn
Now we don't gotta fake it no more, the line's drawn
I'm too much dope dealer for rap niggas
Too much closer to every trap nigga
I'm just preachin' facts, nigga
I'm more biased to the coke-dealin' Coupe drivers
Preludes the debut, My Name Is My Name
God!
I've been in this rap game for a long time
Sometimes all you need is an opportunity
What you’re about to hear is ten dope artists
From across the country, fighting for their shot
What you're about to hear is something special
I'm Pusha-T, and this is :1800 seconds (Yuugh!)
Espera, ven aquí, who you wanna be? Drug Dealer? Demon? Rap nigga? You tryna save the culture? Ay Dios mío. You gotta pick one, daddy
Leave your conscience at the door
We done hid the monsters in the floor
I speak to the trap lords
I done been black balled 
And never gave a fuck ‘cause I’m Jack Frost
Of sellin’ that blast off
Where talent meets timing
Christopher Wallace, Think Big, keep climbing
Reasonable doubt, drug era, keep climbing
I’m my brother’s keeper, Lord Willin’, keep grindin’
Still held back, I done paid with my skin
The only thing missing is a cape on me
You niggas wanna tag a late, great on me
Put the fears in my peers, heard my footsteps coming from the rear
Now it’s murder was the case homie
I’m watching this three ring circus 
Old lions don’t roar, so the clowns ain’t nervous
Even you fools serve purpose 
Let ‘em run amuck until the king resurface
Then it’s off with your heads
They take samples of ‘em, I make examples of ‘em
It’s the thrill of the hunt, I keep my mantle covered
Ask ‘Ye who’s loyalty more realer
Ask P, who’s core’s a drug dealer
The only great I ain’t made better was J. Dilla
Get ready for the placing of the crown
Just remember last year at this time
We were in a fucking cage, okay?
(You remember
I'd like to forget that)
I say be happy with what you've got
(You be happy
Me, I want what's coming to me)
Oh, well what's coming to you?
(The world chico
And everything in it)

See my face on the news and it ain't TiVo
I still wanna sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the pen begging for the RICO
I still wanna sell kilos
Searching for the fishscale like I'm tryna find Nemo
I still wanna sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still wanna sell kilos
Grew up watching momma car repoed
A little nigga staring through the peep hole
How you think I felt knowing daddy wasn't there
Recycling cans cause nobody ever cared
Get it how you live, always echoed in the streets
When we talking business, talking on the phone cease
Piecing puzzles together solving homicides of I's
Dice game chatter, better bring your stash out
Red velour, I'm in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
City of dope a real nigga sell yayo
Everyday a nigga dies and we can't ask why
Show em all love, the bitches f*cked on the side
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work
Testarossa top models, G4s, Gucci pass the crease off
Everything I climb in, I win
Black label everything, logos in the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe push poison like a copper head
Powder fall, smoke clears through the walking dead
The Rose bottles pour for the champions
You'd think it was a Grammy win
Celebration spills through the morning like an Ambien
Bitches love my ambience
Chain swinging, ticker taping like it's Mardi Gras
Thousand niggas deep, never needed body guards
Where the kings crowned like the grill a Maserati's on
Cocaine storaging, Liva living dreams, y'all DeLoreans pouring in
They call him a crack dealer, I am like Warhol
A nigga paint a picture of a bullet for all y’all
My sophomore jinx is more minks
But only for my mother she’ll use ‘em as couch covers
You niggas cheapening my All-Star Weekends
If y’all can’t swim in the deep end then watch nigga
Yuugh! And I ain’t never had to watch nigga
Rich or wealthy, pick your poison
I think I paid for one too many abortions 
Another Celine, it’s like a routine
It’s like ferris wheel of waist trainers and Seven jeans
Her new body's in my new body
Make her in an hourglass that’s my new hobby
Rich nigga shit, how I blew my first million
Luckily was somethin’ in the ceiling, keep dealin
Talk numbers, but never talk ‘em to me though
When you’re the link to what fits in the keyhole
The realest nigga to marathon on the RICO
The last cocaine superhero
I got the cape on, to cover kilos
The villain wins, the evolution of Nino
Nah, you ain’t talkin’ to me though
The Robb Report of the snort
Lawyers get bought
Palms get greased when them cases get fought
No felony what the fuck is you tellin’ me
Reduced to simple assault
It cost to keep it hush-hush
It was just us
Ended up sellin’ my Bat Mobile
The crash don’t kill
It’s how you survives it
Couldn’t miss a Super Bowl or a Cancun
Bitches ain’t respecting niggas not in full bloom
So the neck is full moon
And loving the Alaia pumps
Rich nigga shit, how I lost my second million
Luckily was somethin’ in the ceiling, keep dealin ya
Talk numbers, but never talk ‘em to me though
When you’re the link to what fits in the keyhole
The last cocaine superhero
I got the cape on, to cover kilos
The villain wins, the evolution of Nino
Nah, you ain’t talkin’ to me though
Ten toes deep in the trap, nigga I’m good here
Feelin’ like Tony reading words on the Goodyear
So no threat, be on your steps with the whole hood there
Kerosene in a 20 ounce Poland Spring
Nothing to lose attitude like Ron from Arizona
It’s homicide when I slide up on ya
Reporting live from the project benches
Hella caine, dope in cellophane, dirty syringes 
Heron zombies street-walking on three-week binges
Clientele look like the “Thriller” vid in 3D lenses
COD, niggas never had to front me jawns
I’m weighing bricks on the scale they put the lunch meat on
I’m Nino Brown in the projects
Yes, Curtis Jackson in his pyrex
Get rich or die tryin’ is my mindset
Cause I ain’t never see a Brinks truck follow a hearse 
I ain’t never see a dead man taking the stand
I ain’t never see a nigga swallow a bullet 
And live to talk about it
You watched me go through hell, now watch me walk up out it
Nigga shit, that’s how I lost three million
Unpolished, unapologetic
This cocaine cowboy pushed us to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would've made us timid
We found his old cell, bitch, we searching through the digits
Anything Spanish, got me speaking Spanglish
Money's universal, that's the only language
The dream ain't die, only some real niggas
Left by fathers who wouldn't build with us
I have both mine home, let's keep it real niggas
My better half chose a better path, applaud him
Younger brother - me, a spoiled child, I fought him
I heard that the Devil's new playground is boredom
The California top just falls back like Autumn
And they say I'm on the verge of winning
I'll claim victory when Malice on the verge of sinning
Old habits die hard, the rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's Heaven for a hustla, no graveyards
Cause stand up niggas don't lie on no floors
Much rather burn us, ashes to ashes
Mix it with the powder, sell it to the masses
Now you celebrate, muthafuckas raise your glasses
PUSH!!!
This is my time, this is my hour
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane 'cause they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders, gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided, if you hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, on my side bitch I let tag along
Call me "daddy" from a complex
'Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
And I'm speaking Spanish like Don Omar
But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap, nigga, 'bout trap niggas, I don't sing hooks
Fuck nigga with the sly talk
Miss me with all the pie talk
When them lights on you and them letters there
You point us out just like an eye-chart
But that's my fault, my details of the sidewalk
For 11 years, we seen better years
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than Billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress
'Cause I'm King Push, still King Push
Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle, insult ya
They name dropping 'bout Caine copping
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
Rage against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
In a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best D-boy, all I'm missing is a dash
Difference 'tween me and Hova
But I'm King Push, still King Push
Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I'm just tryna find my way up out this f*cking kitchen
A Birdseye view got me channeling my vision
Turn one to two now the kilo's got a sibling
We kicking up dust like the Colosseum floors
Walls full of safe's like they mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet like she walking through my morgue
Yeah, the fear of God's in you motherf*ckers
This art imitate my life
Your WorldStarHipHop fame based off imitation white
Every dime made in his life more disastrous
While my old bitch went back to get her Masters
Same graduation, I was clapping in the rafters
What goes around comes around, this is life's Ferris wheel
Grab hold and reverse the steering wheel as I parallel park
Kentucky derby on the grill
The fact that I'm free let's me know God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers talk crowns but I'd rather talk fear
Villain like Candyman, say my name and I'll appear
Hakuna matata, feet up, sipping java
Ey yo, strolling up the totem pole, what's my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who shall bed my toddler?
So many hands raised as the band plays
I'm here now, watch how many niggas plans change
And eventually answers to the call of Autumn
Got caught with 30 rocks, the cop look like Alec Baldwin
Inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
And at the airport they check all through my bag
But we stay winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And a new fitted and some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you dunno who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied til all my niggas get it, get it?
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
It's been a while since I watched the tube
Cause like a crip said, "I got way too many blues for any more bad news"
I was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history I don't believe in yesterday
My guy said I need a different approach
Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffing coke
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
Kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it I'm going after whoever who has it
You blowing up, that's good, fantastic
I don't really give a f*ck about it at all
Cause the same people that tried to black ball me
I let you into my diary to admire me
The self righteous drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawn from both sides, I am Siamese
The tug-of-war opens the door, entrada
Rip me apart and see what's inside of this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's one saga
One chapter of black magic, I'm Harry Potter
Feels like I'm doomed to dealing with women who
Relationships with their fathers won't allow us to bloom
And blossom, I swear this Vegas night was f*cking awesome
Loss some niggas, some other niggas double-crossed 'em
Wrestle with the work, we was like the four horsemen
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm muthaf*cking gorgeous, woah
As the gull wing doors lift, Karate Kid, crane kick, no Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coke brush did they paint me with
Sunk leather seats softer than an angels kiss
But they devil-red, tires double tread
I postin parks up, that gives me double head
Tight rope walking, tryna keep a level head
The bright lights blind, look at what the devil did
Yuugh!
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign, then it's my shower
Dope boys, block bleeders
Gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is misguided if it hit the mark, then it's not needed
Carry on like a carry on, and my side bitch I let tag along
Cause her mother's fucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no regard
Step on the brick like a promenade
Twenty thousand on calling cards
And I'm speaking spanish like Don Omar, but
I'm King Push, this king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks
Fuck nigga, with the sly talk
Miss me, with all the pie talk
You point us out, just like an eye-chart
We was sellin' birds over the time port
My first grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than billboard
I got a label deal under my mattress, 'cause
I'm King Push, still king push
I rap nigga 'bout trap niggas
I don't sing hooks
Vultures to my culture
Exploit the struggle, insult ya
But never been a foot soldier
Let's have another look, just get a little closer
In a cranberry Rossta, inside track on the G rap poster
Best d-boy all I'm missing is a dash
Difference between me and Hova, but
I'm King Push, still king push
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you
Uh, I know that you think I'm the one, but who doesn't?
It comes with the territory when you buzzin'
A ball player sold you a dream, ain't do nothing
A couple rappers under your belt, but who's judging?
I ain't trying to guide you, hand on Bible
Thirty-dollar nude catsuits is not cute
And fifty comments on ass is not fluke
So, no cuffing, no buns in the oven
If my girl call your phone, she's just bluffin'
If anybody else do ask, we just nothing
Boy, you got that six in the morning
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Boy, let me love you
With the Givenchy toppa, shoe Balenciaga
If you act right, I can match you up proper
If it's about a dollar thing, big like Poppa
Introduce your exes to my choppa
You know she wanna be you in that vehicle
Riding in see-through V1, V2
Christians or Chloe, damn, them C's too
I know it ain't cheap for you to lay here
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you
Can't commit the crime without accomplice
We both to blame, let's push the shame behind us
On the DL, pushin' my brother’s CL
Meet you at the spot, you had tint on the TL
It’s only right you shake them phony types
Blow it all 'cause the money don’t last
All them broke niggas lookin' puppy-dog sad
She in that new purse, sayin', "Honey, don’t ask"
Boy, you got that six in the morning
You got that thing that'll make a girl feel high
Oh, I say boy, you got me lonely
Just say the words, I'll do anything you want
Boy, let me love you
People looked at me differently and they knew I was with somebody. I didn't have to wait in the line at bakery on Sunday mornings anymore for fresh bread. The owner knew who I was with and he'd come from around the counter. No matter how many people were waiting, I was taken care of first. Our neighbors didn't park in our driveway anymore, even though we didn't have a car. I mean at 13, I was making more money than most of the grownups in the neighborhood.  I mean I had more money than I could spend. I had it all!
I'm up in the woods
I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still
To slow down time
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city
Down for the night
I'm lost in the world
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Said shes down for the night
I’m the real Situation, I should be on Jersey Shore
We found a superfreak, no, she won’t know what hit her
I’m on my Rick James, minus the beads and glitter
You’ve got to beg my pardon, this shit here is money talking
You don’t get good dick too often, I’mma have you funny walking
Damn, too late you lost it, back to that world you lost in
Back to that world you lost in
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
(Run from the lights, run from the night)
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
(Run for your life, down for the night)
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night
Down for the night
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable
Mami tryna land a Sinatra
So she don't fuck niggas with Apple Watches
Shout out to dope boy lit sixteen swipers
Movie on my neck with the screen gems
Me and my nigga havin' bottle wars
40 thousand on the floor when them bottles pour (Spill, nigga)
A Blu Ray to your DVD
You might've caught me on TMZ
Cameo tryna sue a nigga (Fuck 'em)
Cause I party hard like it's three of me
America's still abusing us
And 9/11 is the Ku Klux
So why wouldn't I fire back
True enough, I'm out of line
You better stand for something 'fore you out of time
If the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable
Poppy get me everything I want
Riding 'round with Miguel Cotto in the trunk
Mink, leather or it's lizard, nigga
The mannequin to you ballplayers
Shout out my Mac 11 monster
Grew up on Nintendo playing Contra
And though that nigga only 5'9"
100 bodies on his timeline
Lost my bitch, bought a chef
Hottest 7, I'm so alive
Your bank account Swiss, nigga, so is mine
If the crown ain't mine, tell me who am I behind
Yeah, I'm taking niggas' lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only dope boy quotable
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!
Play your role, it’s easy acting like Mitch
Paid in full is really just being Rich Porter
Filling all standing orders
Would you question could I swim if you saw me walking on water?
Yeah, while every song got a rapper dance
Yuugh, I’m drug money like Dapper Dan
No retirement plans, no Derek Jeters
We all know I did it; Rodriguez
The illusion of money we don’t believe in
I’m Kim Jong of the crack song
‘Cause we done see all and they telling lies
Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!
You rather be more famous than rich
Play your role, it’s easy being my bitch
It’s only right for a queen to floss your shit
The minimums, niggas ain’t synonyms
Dual exhausts, driving flying saucers
And laugh at bitches fucking promoters
Hoping that they get noticed, still driving a Focus
What you fuck him for if you didn’t know what the goal was?
Shine, remote control blinds
That turn on the time lapse, controlled by the iPad
Ahhh, my living room rap scream crack money
I don’t trust rap niggas or rap money
Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!
Niggas talking it, but ain’t living it
They ask why I’m still talking dope, why not?
The biggest rappers in the game broke, voilà
They say it’s hate, but it’s these well-dressed snakes
That learn to walk on the concrete, I just saw it and spoke to it
Yuugh, you ain’t know, you got coached through it
Haaa, the whole time I sold coke through it
Nigga, and records I was Bo through it
King Push is synonymous with kingpin
Uh, this is O Dog in the courtyard
You wonder why I’m still here
I’m America’s worst nightmare
Night, night nigga
Creep up on these niggas
Creep up on these niggas
Speak up on a nigga
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Walk up in that bitch and wave at everything
Go and make it bang, go and make it bang
Gettin’ followed by them hollows, go and make it bang
Niggas ain’t been to church in a minute
But it’s funny how that TEC make a nigga get religious
Amen!

Niggas still hands on, whip it like a sandstorm
Had the audacity to sell it in a damn poem
Get you higher Angelo, the author of this anthems
Like the clear glass on that coupe I steer past
Money on my mind like my pillow is a vault
You niggas is soft so on that pillow’s where you talk
Can’t find it in them d-list actresses on mattresses
Your real chance to loving you bachelors, I laugh at them
Bitches love money, I granting them three wishes, Push
Ya ain't even know that you got an aka did you?
Always in that fly shit, Mike Dean what up? Brendan

The fear of Gods in these motherfuckers
Niggas ain’t fucking with me man, no games, yeah

Waiting by your doorstep, hidin' in the bushes (Mhmm)
Got a vest on, got a gun that can really do it (Mhmm)
You niggas playin' with real niggas' money, get fronted
One day you is the plug, next day you in the dumpster
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (Sprayin')
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Quit playin')
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin'
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (We sprayin')
You don’t know 'bout this life, nigga
Earnin' all of these stripes, nigga
Kilograms, Peter Pans, pack holders on bikes, nigga
Throwin' bitches on flights, nigga
They ain't know that they dyke, nigga
'Til the money’s out and the bottle's pourin'
Rose gold on my wrist, this Rolex like Devil's piss
This Daytona illuminate, y'all think I'm talkin' that Devil shit
This fifty racks, no bezel shit
This mo' guns, this mo' bodies
We call shots, they nobodies
They fuck niggas, they owe prolly
Who fuckin' with me? Nobody
When the guns drawn, they so sorry
Bullets out the barrel make your body jerk
Fuck with my money and I'll hit you with that body work
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (No Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Quit playin')
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin'
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (We sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (Ain't no Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Playin', nigga)
Bad bitches on deck, nigga
Money, power, respect, nigga
Everybody be rap dissin'
I catch niggas, I check niggas
These goons with me don't spit no verses
Black 'maro 2 S, nigga
Couple birds on my neck, nigga
Every time them hoes see me
They like, "Meek Milly, you a mess, nigga"
Two gats, no vest, nigga
This gold Rollie that's on my wrist
Leprechaun prolly die for
Young boys that's on my strip
Will kill anything I say ride on, bow!
T-tell them niggas call us if they out of work
'Cause we liftin' weights but we don't do no body work
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (Sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (No Klan)
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin'
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (We sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (Ain't no Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Playin', nigga)
Know we love that KK sound, you know we not backin' down
Hunnid drum like, "Hold that doe", diamonds flash like Kodak though
Straight cash, nigga, fuck that loan, seven digits on that phone
Money so long, smoke a whole zone
Getting blood money, tryna put my cuz on
Bitch, I'm on fire, got my jaw wired
Sex, money, murder, Petey Rollack (Soundview, whaddup)
Body work, chopper work like a techno song
Twenty thou' a show, I just hope my nigga Max come home (wavey)
Money fast, diamonds flash like high beams
Make it rain in this bitch, Hurricane Irene
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga, we sprayin' (Sprayin')
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (No Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Quit playin')
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin'
Ridin' with three K's and I ain't talkin' 'bout the Klan (Ain't no Klan)
This ain't no arcade, nigga, so quit playin' (Playin', nigga)
It’s eatin' time, me and my niggas buffetin' (We winnin')
I see the strangest things
The evil that money brings
That goes round and round and round like sirens
And they wanna bury me
Why? Cause I’m anti everything
I swear it’s like a disease
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
The three leading killers of you niggas
Is the shit that’s most appealing to you niggas
The lies will get you through it
Money, pussy, alcohol, what a wonderful cocktail
Fronted my first brick over oxtails and ran with it
Dope is like a two-way street
Every sparkle in the club that wasn’t ours, we compete
Poor minds, poor decision makers
No reward, then what’s the risk you taking?
Won’t unveil it yet, can’t tell it yet
Defense wins games Bill Belichick
These hoes having Google numbers, niggas better check
Yuugh
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
I woke up and really had it all
Shout out my bitches fucking baseball niggas
That dress like Bamas with guaranteed contracts
Now the Major League’s where you're fishing
You young and hot, so why not?
The dealers is washed, the money is dry, so take your best shot
For real, we made you watch from afar
Even talked down on you, tryna dim your star
And watch them pick you up
And then we realized we missed a diamond in the rough
So, make us proud, make it count
Until you learn to love ‘em, make ‘em spare no amount
Take advantage of it when you’re worth it
Money, pussy, alcohol
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not at all
Get in them drawers
Lose your mind, go insane
I got money, you got money too
You think it’s honey dew
Whispering in my ear like a hunny do
Eyeballing every bottle that we running through
Trying to stand near, nigga damn near
It’s no pictures, now you in your feelings
I’m a real dope boy, no stranger dealings
Bruised ego, Henny-induced Debos
Nickel bag niggas, all of a sudden Ninos
I cancel all of you G-Moneys for G money
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
Get in them drawers
I had a dream I had it all
See the future like the car show floor models
Both feet in the snow, so that my core follows
Drown sorrows, ocean blue Murcielagos
The formula is warning ya
Crack kills offerings to the coroner
Kill my eldest brother? Nigga, I’ll be damned
A hustler’s paradise, a lucky pair of dice
Cause the batter I add had the coca base
There’s no feeling like your bitch chin chilling right
You in Italian leather and you're four wheeling right
You know you’re up when you count a quarter mil in white
And if you down you can slang it like a pillow fight
I’m a wizard at it, nigga here’s the magic
Make a small town feel like I throw a blizzard at it
Get the green from the scale like a lizard had it
Bear witness as I unveil this instant classic
Yes! My God!
The first coming still here, so I’ll need a hearse
I got a voodoo doll every time I pen a verse
Not only do they say they feel it but say it hurts
No pain, no gain, nigga
I only change when the new body came, nigga
Aerodynamic, roof panoramic
My credit score let the dealer take full advantage
Paid over sticker price, cash under handed
The 012 a year early, I’m a time bandit
Gotta time manage when you heaving snow
They’ll be no waiting, I have no patience
This is the end for all my unrecognized greatness
I’m here now, nigga, pardon my lateness
It’s the new god flow, ain’t it
Take position on the chess board and rearrange it
Face to face with the truth, get reacquainted
No flex zone, No flex zone
No flex zone, No flex zone
They know better, they know better
I treat it so special
They tens or better
I'm a trendsetter
I'm a go-getter
Who ain't waiting on King Push?
Got niggas checking for them new flows
Sold more dope than the old Jigga
Now niggas calling me the new Hov
Let the coupe go, planetarium
Let the roof go like Cesarean
Just a hunnid bottles they carrying
This foreign nigga, he ain't know better
I lose the plane on this fool nigga
Bought dope with my album budget
Play Cloths was the blueprint
Four million in four seasons
Fuck who care for my fashion sense
Tell a ho come and swim in the money (splash)
Broke niggas just stop at the heel
I could body paint you in them name brands
And put a red bow on the wheels
See I'm just in and out, I call a rent a mouth
Suck the ice out of a bezel
Use my rap persona, fuck baby mommas
If I am the problem
Then you cannot solve it
You live in the crosshairs
When you are the target
It's hard to stay underground
From sun up to sundown
I'm glowing regardless
We came with the mission
To take it, you gotta be heartless
One of the hardest, ah
I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh
I get the feeling like I'm high
On my life you ain't gon' want these problems
Take you down ain't gon' be no problem
Watch when you play with God
I got diamonds dancing in my mouth
Think you the king of this house, I'm coming for you
I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh
Dead or alive, I'm wanted
Just like a ghost, I'm haunted
The Angel of Death is upon us
It's not a threat, it's a promise
Killing at will if we honest
I tell you, no lie, it's Jekyll and Hyde
When you are like one with the monsters
I am the problem (yugh)
I got the power (yugh)
I got the pull, I run with the bulls
You run with the cowards
I put out the hit, your funeral's lit
I show up with flowers
I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh
I get the feeling like I'm high
On my life you ain't gon' want these problems
Take you down ain't gon' be no problem
I got the Tec and the squad coming for you
I got diamonds dancing in my mouth
Think you the king of this house, I'm coming for you
I be the realest one alive, you don't want no problems
Take you down, it ain't gon' be no problem, yugh
Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasted time, can't get that back
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
Say hi to the bad guy, say ahhh to the champagne
(Woo!) They see I'm doing my damn thing
Magazines, videos, they ain't missing a damn thing
Nowadays I sell hope, what you rather I sell dope?
What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats
Rent-a-cars we road run, money longer than train smoke
Representing my niggas down 'til they free 'em like Django
It's the same old, just the same old
How the game go, where the pain go, where the blame go?
My mind wanders on a PJ, my momma brought up in the PJs
If I leave today, throw the keys away
But I'mma live today, I wanna see tomorrow, I wanna lead the way
Wasted time, can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...
Momma had me in the ghetto, I was raised in the slums
Every hero got theme music, guess I need me some drums
Bought me a 5 for 50, I bust 'em down, it was jumps
Streets taught us, streets raised us, had it less determined
Dodging jackers, dodging murders, federal to state pen
Uncle got power, now I see him in another ten
We was set up just to lose, Lord know we trying to win
In the pursuit of this power, this masterpiece to the hour
You know it's platinum and waterproof, wear this bitch in the shower
In the hood, I'm a king, King Arthur to the people
Except he got his on a Chariot, I got mine in a Regal
Sport cars, Italian leather, Princess Cut with baguettes
Law of physics say them 9s weigh more when they wet
No regrets
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasted time, can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Came from making real figures (Too much money)
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...
Presidential, I came back, April showers, I rains back
Jumped ahead like June something, still I'm wheeling that Maybach
Time forward, my braids back, Tom Ford and my shades black
Dope boy with a cape on, super-sizing that beige back
All white like Gotti said, Ye told me I'm outta here
Mentioned Ye two years ago, yeah, I got that by the square (Woo!)
And you could buy a pair, twenty or more and we'll fly 'em there
How you acting like I ain't here? D-Boy and I pioneer
Yeah, I'm on the move, I can-can't look back (No way)
Screaming, "No regrets, no regrets at all"
Wasted time, can't get that back
Uh, so everyday I go hard
Real nigga and all my niggas real niggas
Nothing less, no regrets (Let's get it)
No-no, no regrets, ahhh...
W-W-W-What is it?
Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder there's diaper rash on my conscience
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a Minute Steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got their mule on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and a arm full of watches
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, "If he dies, he dies"
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dying – dead, yuugh!
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah" (What is it?)
You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my momma's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, geez, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took a L, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, "Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter"
He said, "Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense"
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga!
Now reap what you sowed, nigga! (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
Now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession
Let's get it
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"You better change ch-change, ch-change, ch-change, cha-ange"
"You better change what comes out your speaker"
"Th-Th-Th-Th-They must be on the dick of who?"
(Yeah!) How you feelin'?
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
Your SL's missin' a S, nigga
Your plane's missin' a chef
The common theme, see they both got wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's only one God, and it's only one crown
So it's only one king that can stand on this mound
Coast Guard come a hundred goin' overboard
I got money with the best of 'em
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your side bitches settle in
Might have to headbutt your Evelyn
Might reach back and relapse to wrappin' up this raw
Givenchy fittin' like it's gym clothes
We really gymstars, I'm like D. Rose
No D-League, I'm like this close
'88 Jordan, leapin' from the free throw
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more
25 bricks, move work like chore
Hit Delaware twice, needed 25 more
Come and meet the pieman, a must that I flaunt it
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Can't a bitch livin' say I bought her Michael Kors
Keep the sticker in the window 'case you wonder what it cost
How could you relate when you ain't never been great?
And rely on rap money to keep food up on your plates, nigga?
I might sell a brick on my birthday
36 years of doin' dirt like it's Earth Day, God
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
It's coming clear I've noticed
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Two sides, what the game'll do
Stackin' mine, nigga ye high
Couldn't imagine a better view
From the pool house you see four cars
Bad bitches, they skinny dippin'
Mixed college bitches with porn stars
Disconnected my OnStar, no GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, went ocular, that's CBS
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon
Bloggers get your trace on, 500 horses race on
Coke ties, that coke dries, it's cemented, it's baked on
Eghck! That's based on, the life of a nigga who ain't said nothin'
Trunk tight, trunk white, can't relate if you ain't bled nothin'
You askin' me to tell you why you niggas never had nothin'
Folarin back, the hardest out I put us on the map
We ain't hatin', cause we ain't y'all, too much Ciroc we CB4
62, black on black, see my vehicle is like MEAC ball
Shoutout to Norfolk, kicks from Portland, my hoes from Portsmouth
Y'all nick and dime, if a brick was 'round you might need a forklift
Can't fuck with us cause me and my niggas ride
That's right, what up Pusha T, it's DMV for life
Giuseppe Zanotti, I beg your pardon, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Tell these motherfuckers get me doe
Iceberg Shorty, mu' fuck your Disney store
Behind these walls, still in our thoughts, the city know
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why
It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why
Two sides, what the game'll do
Stackin' mine, nigga ye high
Couldn't imagine a better view
From the poolhouse you see four cars
Bad bitches, they skinny dippin'
Mixed college bitches with porn stars
Disconnected my OnStar, no GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, one ocular, that's CBS
Aston Martin, DBS, James Bond cool as James Todd
Best nigga to make hits and run base since A-Rod
Hands dirty like Ason, I'm grindin' nigga you J Kwon
My Diors is distressed, CDG vest with Jays on
Eghck! That's based on, the life of a nigga who ain't said nothin'
Trunk tight, trunk white, can't relate if you ain't bled nothin'
Now that there said somethin', don't make me have to dead nothin'
You askin' me to tell you why you niggas never had nothin'
It's coming clear I've noticed
It's a different face you're showing
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it tell me why
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can say
Only you can tell it
Tell me why
Folarin back, the hardest out I put us on the map
My eyes low, I keep 5 rolled so my THC be makin' sound effects
We ain't hatin', cause we ain't y'all, too much Ciroc we CB4
62, black on black, see my vehicle is like MEAC ball
Shoutout to Norfolk, kicks from Portland, my hoes from Portsmouth
Y'all nick and dime, if a brick was 'round you might need a forklift
Can't fuck with us cause me and my niggas ride
Giuseppe Zanotti, I beg your pardon, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Three something for an after party and Balenciaga, I filled Arenas twice
Tell these motherfuckers get me doe
Iceberg Shorty, mu' fuck your Disney store
And remove your words, G double O-D, MMG we good
Got Zamunda furs, don't know how Akeem, but Pusha's semi cold
My nigga Geezy out in VA, I hope you hear these flows
Behind these walls, still in our thoughts, the city know
It's coming clear I've noticed
It's another "welcome back"
I don't imagine it could be this way, so jealous
Only you can tell it, only you can say
Only you can tell it
Only you can tell it
Tell me why
Prometh flow for the slow sippers
And if you on your paper chasing, I’ma roll with ya
About an onion, it odors a bag of Funyuns
Bitches packaging dozens, fuck ‘em until they malfunction
I laugh my ass off, taking shots like a gunman
I don’t hunt game, motherfucker, I hunt men
Take ‘em to the back of my pick-up truck to rot them
Kill a fuckin’ superhero, I watch the Watchmen
My Glock that’s cocked, loaded, and ready to lock in
Who’s sending niggas to the dirt? Ostriches
Captain holding them captive fucking hostages
Create carnage from cartridges, eating the heart of pigs
To murder, homicide’s a part to live with that
Grab your Teflon, ammunition, and your gat
Unless you wanna get shitted on like porn scat
Oooh, you ain’t sayin’ nada
Guns drawn, niggas scream opera
38 snub or the chopper
You better hope the Lord is your doctor
Like, oooh, you ain’t sayin’ nada
Guns drawn, niggas scream, opera
38 snub or the chopper
Middle finger goes to the coppers
You better hope the Lord is your doctor
Like, oooh
Hey Hodgy, hey Tyler, don’t mind us
(We kill ‘em all, 50 shots, fuck kindness
In all black Versace dressed in the finest)
We sell it all, even the drugs are designers
Gangsta bitches, Red Monkeys for the ecstasy
(Fuck it, take ‘em all, overdose the recipe
Let them hoes show they true colors-) crew lovers
Passed around like a cold (It’s a zoo of us)
Two brothers, add two others just the news of it
Make the net crash, the ultimate “Who done it?”
(And who knew Sarah Palin with the sniff type daughter knocked up
But she was knocking down Glen Rice)
Been nice since the Wolf Gang was baby pups
(Golf Wang full grown, now they crazy fucks)
Add two dope boys known for taping up
(Kick in the door, now the world ain’t safe enough)
Oooh, you ain’t sayin’ nada
Guns drawn, niggas scream opera
38 snub or the chopper
You better hope the Lord is your doctor
Like, oooh, you ain’t sayin’ nada
Guns drawn, niggas scream, opera
38 snub or the chopper
Middle finger goes to the coppers
You better hope the Lord is your doctor
Spit bars, this hard, teen sixteen bars
I’m fucking the game when its vagina got my dick scarred
Um, sure it’s ‘Preme button up floral
Stack of money, dark shades, looking like a fucking tourist
Or it’s the Tourettes that my fucking neck have
I’m like a average nigga in the 20’s of the 18’s
And I’m not even 20, dropped a classic at my 18
The wolves finally reconcile
While mouth watering, this shit is sick and fucking vile
Trying to fuck my destiny, they couldn’t find another child
Lyrics from Snippet
If my girl called your phone, she just bluffin'
If anybody else do ask, we just nothin'
Boy, you got that six in the mornin'
"O—"
"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor—"
I'm just a poor boy—"
"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy—"
Seeing is believin', believe when you see it
They tied me to a mountain of it, I just try to ski it
Long distance wireless Kinect like I Wii it
Double-U double-I, spelled so you can see it
Cause it's way over their heads when I Ray Allen 3 it
I'm Rondo on the bongos when giving you my convo
We ain't been home since we were snatched out the Congo
Toast to progress as I'm staring out my condo
Made it this far and I ain't never been a Tonto
Yuh, as you compare me to a fuckin' rookie
You can't respect the new school when you played hookie
Cooked white, turned it tan, sold world Snooki
School of Hard Knocks, look at where the game took me
To the limit like Montana with better grammar
Bigger homes with bigger guns and better cameras
"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy—"
You are now listening to the future
Open your eyes, nigga, and see what I see
Don't mind me—I'm just here to restore the feeling
Yeah, I'm just here to restore the feeling
You feel the pressure, yeah
I never pitched a penny in a wishing well (Never)
I laid it all on a fishing scale (Yes)
And an apron that hung from a kitchen nail
Straight from my memoirs as I kiss and tell
Big faces like Rushmore, touch more
Fashion trailblazers, trendsetters look to us for
The next mission when the tide dries up
Fifteen years abducting spies like us
Jail doesn't resonate with guys like us
Told Wesley at the Oscars to slide like us
Didn't listen, so prison is what they did to him
Accountant unscathed, millions is what they hid through him
"Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy—"
The odds is against us
No excuses though, we just play harder
Hustle smarter, yeah
Congratulations, my nigga
Now let TIP go, yuh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Money goin' in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
Getting money, baby girl, gold chains
I don't never feel pain
Blood flowing through my veins
Getting money, rocking chains
We'll never feel the same
We the thugs in the game
I don't never feel pain
Eighteen-wheeler gorillas
Black with gold chains, pitch bird like Steelers
Hines Ward of the crime lords
Running through this money, screaming, "Encore!"
Spending nights with a prime whore
Celebrating on a whim, nigga
Pain is Pac, Above the Rim, nigga
My bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas
'Cause she was there when it was dim, nigga
She wasn't fucking none of them niggas
So now we're even like a hem, nigga
Put your freedom over failure
Tryna find my Griselda (La Madrina!)
Might as well, they gon' nail ya
Momma screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and it's war
Pain is running out of raw
Pain is finding out you're poor
As the Feds knock at your door
'Cause I done felt too much pain
Been around here, standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring
Pain is joy when it cries
It's my smile in disguise
It's what makes the story chilling
Spare the women and the children
Hear the scribbles of the villain
Pyrex on the platter like hot sex
Pain in this bitch, with a mask and a glove
It's no risk without gain
It's no trust without shame
It's no us without 'caine
Push: my name is my name
In the kitchen with a cape on, apron
Trey-eight on, coulda been Trayvon
Powder-face like a geisha
Arm & Hammer for the breakup
Turn one into two, watch the brick kiss and makeup (woo!)
It's a match made in heaven
All that's missing is the reverend
All that's missing is a blessing
I hope God gets the message
Been around here, standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rock a hundred gold chains
I don't never feel pain
'Cause I done felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rocking all these gold chains
Million dollars on one gold ring
Since we on the topic, let me be obnoxious
This ain’t just no style war, this right here is Shottas
I just paid that ransom, stuntin’ on you biatches
We shoppers, you bloggers, if money talks, you mumblers
You try it on then take it off, then post a pic on yo Tumblrs
We flip that, it somersault, we get it back cuz we hustlers
It’s heatin’ up, we fired up like Waco
They place the order, we cross the border with pesos
Do you wanna make pies? Yes, I wanna make pies
Let me see it in your eyes, I wanna make pies
Then try this exercise
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies?
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies, pies
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies?
Yes, I wanna make
Pyrex bake pans, watch birds break-dance
I measured it perfect, the product’s in great hands (WOO)
You want the spoils, cook it to the oils
Couple diamonds keep ya bitch loyal
Roger Federer Rolex, my wrist royal.(Yeaughh)
Goyard trunks for luggage, nigga
Tell the bellman at the plaza not to tug it, nigga(Wooh)
Oh, it’s only luxury, when you ain't got it (Wooh)
Take a look at BabyGinny closet
All cocaine sponsored,the Nextel chirp era it made monsters
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies, pies?
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies?
Yes, I wanna make
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies, pies?
Do you wanna make, do you wanna make, do you wanna make pies?
Yes, I wanna make
Got my hands tied, the power's above me
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just a puppet here
Family, fortune, envy, jealousy
Privilege, passed on legacy
Secret, sabotage, borderline felony
Suicide, subtract, selfish, pedigree
When the love's gone, and the hate's there
Better watch out, 'cause it's Cape Fear
When your family ain't your family
And your legacy is just a name there
In your mother's eyes is a blank stare
But your father's pickin' who remains here
It's a power struggle, it's a tug-of-war
That's amongst the kids, and it ain't fair
Yeugh, who gon' stop the pain?
We are not the same
It's a free fall when I leave y'all (Whoa)
(If you love me, please don't judge me
My bloodline was not chosen (Ooh)
This bank account is not frozen
If you love me, please don't judge me
Family, fortune, envy, jealousy
Privilege, passed on legacy
Secret, sabotage, borderline felony
Suicide, subtract, selfish, pedigree, yeugh
Privilege, passed on legacy
Secret, sabotage, borderline felony
Suicide, subtract, selfish, pedigree, yeugh
Yeah, look
Look
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?"
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' "Makaveli"
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin so we bail-ready
Still find a brick in my Tupperware
Two can get you four like a double-dare
Buried in the snow, bring a shovel here
Ever since I ran into a deficit
Had it sent, [?]
I just wanna-wanna, I was goin' George Jetson
Niggas still treatin' me like George Jefferson
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I buy you a sick truck
I buy you some new tits, I get you that nip-tuck
I start a new family, the condom done slipped up
(I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck, I like)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I buy you a sick truck
We start another family, the condom done slipped up
Zip shut, this, this shut
I like my dick sucked, I buy you a sick truck
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I buy you a sick truck
I buy you some new tits, just keep the (Aw fuck, aw fuck)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I buy you a sick truck
I buy you some new tits, I buy you that nip-tuck
Just keep your lips shut, bitch, zipped shut
*gibberish*
I’m only in the company of kings
I made a power move and it’s everything it seems
Before 'Ye signed me, I was getting out my dreams
Every time a nigga wanna try and turn a profit
Folks rush in, three letters try and stop it
F-B-I-R-S, D-E-A
One letter short but still motherfuck the DA
We play by the rules as they try to crack the code
Leopard print Louboutins prowling the concrete
Rollerballs come alive just like Jumanji
You know where to find me
Greenhouse a circle of top whores
Mandarin, Gansevoort, any them top floors
35 large, took it right out the top drawer
Still got a throwaway phone in my sock drawer
It’s like Raid! Spraying on you roaches
The AK is an animal, it is ferocious
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring, a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'Less he is an insomniac, he'll die in a dream
You can tell I went to school on a small yellow bus
Never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from powdered jelly donuts to taking them Os
Look, I’m all grown up and I done blown up
You’ll take my word for it or make me do it to ya
I’m a magnet to murder, when I’m in the mood
Get convicted through the forensics when you walk in my shoes
I’m bad news, you niggas know the verdict, I’m filthy
Drop Phantom is milky, white on white
24 inch blades, I'm skatin'
Red eyes, smoking that bomb shit, I'm Satan
50 back running round this bitch strapped, hitman for hire
It’s like Raid! Spraying on you roaches
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring, a nigga won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring a nigga won't sing
'less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream, ugh!
I sit with the liars, duck tape and tiers
Been lost their soul, they just waiting on the fire
Something out of nothing, a team full of MacGyvers
Deep-sea dive for the fishscale
Tryna find a better price? Man, that ship sailed
Take a breath and head back if that shit failed
Drop weight like an anchor; then, you set sail
Hell freeze over like the watch I put the sleeve over
Engine devil-scream when I turn the key over
Yuugh! Re-Up Gang with the G-Unit
Test it on your tongue or either watch a fiend do it
I got you hooked and I laugh as you lean to it
It’s like Raid! Spraying on you roaches
A nigga wanna sing, hope he is the dopest
Watch that nigga disappear; hocus pocus
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
'Less he is an insomniac he'll die in a dream
They think that they know, something 'bout my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
I just took her home with her
Boomerang, Stron'jay
Yo hijo - pequeño, my nachos - bell grande
Stay sippin' that André
Spent 3 stacks - that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say:
Hope your bitch don't land on him
You small time - you Hyundai's
You couch niggas - we stand on em
Dope money with a band on it
D-boys still ball the same
Just gotta little bit of glam on it
YAH!
As I get hotter, haters get madder
Escalator up...fuck a ladder!
Success callin', your world's shattered
They say it's destiny; to me, it never mattered
Say you gettin' money, we goin' overboard
New Years with my bitch in the Palm suite
The Don Dotta, the kingpin
I jump squares on you muthafuckas; king him
The Aston was ice-blue, I went Tron on 'em
Now handle that, bitch, handle that
White dripping off the pot like candle wax
Let it dry then it's on to the next one
I'm Raekwon in the kitchen when I chef one
I'm light-years beyond Balenciaga pythons
You put 'em back after you try 'em on
Forklifting the palate, nigga, pile it on
Cocaine cowboys, no spurs, but I'm stylin' on
Run the Late Night, get my Jimmy Fallon on
Request love (With ?uestlove) on that price that they peggin' on
I beat a different drum
G.O.O.D. Music, but I speak it with a different tongue
The numb one becomes number 1
See us Grammy night; bow ties and cummerbunds
Ciroc soak bad bitch, I'm layin' under one
Make her work for it, night nurse for it
In the morning she can get her heel and purse for it
The way I'm killin' shit, you should send a hearse for it
I’m glad that you noticed
The realest nigga here
It’s kinda chilly being the coldest
Me and Timbo in that two-door, making our ”Otis"
Now witness the chosen
It’s just different here
Monte Carlo nights, let her throw the dice
All I know is white
Get the powder gone
Mattress full of money, let it break the fall
Woo! She used to fly on a buddy pass
They say when the money go, you hope that your honey last
I been preaching since money, cash— hoes
And I promise, I hardly see you
From where I am it’s so hard to see you
Got money I’ve been different ever since
Maybe it’s me and my arrogance
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you? We don’t know you
I’m the fire and the base
I’m admired by the greats
This to each and every rap nigga
I look you liars in the face
Cold case, Rolls Wraith 
Big dipper, constellation in the ceiling, see the stars
See the jewelry, all rock, no guitar 
Who you know better with the raw?
Bogota, she like finessing niggas
She gets a Range Rover Sport 
And got seats on the court from the best of niggas
I never bit at that apple
I never lost my El Chapo
I can still grab it, and bag it and capsule 
Covered in white like I walked in the chapel
I’m that cold
From where I am it’s so hard to see you
Got money I’ve been different ever since
Maybe it’s me and my arrogance
Who are you? We don’t know you
Who are you? We don’t know you
The last dope dealer
Red leather in a room full of Thrillers
The mamas, they zombies
Chase a nigga for the money, they behind me
Woo, safe look like it got a printer
Ain’t no rappers in that Sprinter
Ain’t no saints, only sinners
What bitch ain’t fucked a winner?
I’m a blue ribbon nigga
Talk down on you two pigeon niggas
Front five or better
Yeah, I got a mountain of it, you could climb forever
Recorded in Emirate's palace
I bring to you the Fear of God
Liva Don
Steven Victor on the camera
Virgil what up
They say this took confidence, I just call it patience
Cause I had too much pride to take this motherfucking cadence
Knowing the Feds watch me, private paparazzi
Still chasing me for war crimes like a Nazi
Against all odds, see the judge tryna' Pac me
Lucky dice roll got my lawyers screaming, Yahtzee
Who the fuck can stop me run away freight train
Mike Vick's redemption, big doggin like a great dane
12 cylinders 50 grams of willing ya
These rappers get away with pushing these child Illingers
Now it's hard feelings, I just put my ceiling up
Planetarium Push, the I-Max experience
They say I talk coke for 9 years long
That means my rap sheet is more than 9 years strong
You niggas would have thought that I was 9 years gone
But I am still in the mix like 9 ounces and a straw
Nigga get your bag on, bitch get your bag on
Balenciaga Hobo so heavy that you drag home
Yeah, see my verses let you tag along
Swim in the oasis of this drug dealers Babylon
Three bitches, three different flights
Glad it was four sides at that Paul Williams fight
The Wynn, the Bellagio, the Palms three nights
As long as they are separated they are my three blind mice
You can't just rap this, the same mindset
Wish every doughboy could get a fair crack at this
They say when one ends, that begins a new chapter
Can I live
You tell me, can I live
Two-door, four-door, sedan, roadster
We balling — ESPN highlights, posters
Tangerine Lambos, mimosa, raise a toast
We at the Grammys, then Miami
Playing Boca like it’s poker
Had a room at the La Quinta
Full of soldiers, full of coca
Feel a ulcer
Hundred grand up in the sofa, reupholstered
I am twisted
Saying Heath Ledger Joker to you jokers
If you Tony, I hang up, send a hit, I am Sosa
I am cultured, I am legend
I am Liva, I am closer
To the best writer alive
Other two, I’m the closest
No holsters, no chauffeurs
No mask, no witness
C-I-two A
And 2 Chainz, with my bad bitch — it’s my b-day
This life that we live is for the connaisseurs
Carnival, gives our form
Everyday pool side cabana floss
Mami in Monolos, I’m in that Gucci polo
With the multi color moving dolo on my solo
My niggas that’s in prison I’m their eyes and their ears
Every champagne night, for every laugh there’s a tear
There’s a picture being shown, every jail every tear
Representing so my niggas know I’m here
Poloroids being shown in every jail, every tear
From Virginia, never rated
Before us, no one ever made it
Dope boy lane, a nigga paved it
When every nigga was afraid to say it
Sold a mill, spent a mill
We was grindin', Lord's will
Never thought of hiatus
All these bitches, high maintenance
But I love it though, I cater
Deal fell, Tony saved us
After blowing up, Al Qaeda
Feds rushed like Raiders
Took our coach down, Al Davis
Regroup, tears faded
Casket Drop a year later
Three albums, three majors
Only critics to our favor
Put the spin on it, tornados
Our father, thy neighbor
Couldn't tell me that God hate us
I was lost, I was jaded
Malice found his way to our savior
Now author, he offers
Way to view it 'fore I see coffins
Way to view it 'fore we see vultures
Different way to view it, for the culture
Ross called 'em, Ye and all them
In Hawaii, Jay and all them
I was honored to be called in
Ran away with it, "So Appalled" them
Goin' in the vault, it will earth you
I'm back in with P, it's full circle
Only cause Dre say
I made a million on a corner, sniff
I ain't even had to stand on it
They say numbers don't lie, well dope boy, put your bands on it
Bet it nigga, Patek Philippe on you peasant niggas
Commonwealth, got the open foul
I'm the poster child for alleged dealers
These niggas mention my name
With their little rumors and their little jewelers
That's no threat, that's no sweat
My little shooters ride little scooters
Fuck you know about a motorcade full of millionaires
Hole in ones, we're like billionaires
Chain linked, they change colors, I'm Chamillionaire
This is sealskin walls, this is trap door floors
I charted nigga no borders nigga, we above those laws
I'm really running from the R.I.C.O
Yeah, I'm really dodging all them people
Uh huh, I run a marathon on the R.I.C.O
Y'all just waiting on the sequel
Beats One yeah
Ay yo, they said it's 10 points higher up there
We got to go get that
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
From the rascal alf-alphabet boys
Trackin' choppers in the highway patrol
And I know once I get there that it's sold
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
While I get this dough
Chevy Malibu; we graduated from them renteds
It's only four letters, I ain't worried 'bout a sentence (k-i-l-o)
Travelin' the distance, stayin' off the white line
Alphabet boys out prayin' what they might find
I hate the Carolinas, racial profiler
Say you smokin' marijuanas, fuck you talkin 'bout
My piss is clearer than my mama's, with her church wig on
996 before I get my Big on
Thousand grams, thousand hands, thousand furs, thousand bands
Hundred thousand dollar horse all-star; we stylin' in
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
From the rascal alf-alphabet boys
Trackin' choppers in the highway patrol
And I know once I get there that it's sold
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
You niggas ain't takin' road trips for real
Route 13 with the vacuum seal
Pre-paid Legal on my window shield
The ice cream man's on his Jack & Jill
Moving weight state to state; MACK trucks I deal, MACK trucks I fill
I feel better knowin' that the donor is anonymous
See, my diamond is growin'
Tugboat or car tow, we summertime snowin'
Reasonable Doubt flowin' on your niggas
Been gettin' it since '96 in black AC Vigors
Snub .38 with the matte black trigger
When How Can I Be Down was filled with crack niggas
Lord Father, I don't mean to be a bother
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
From the rascal alf-alphabet boys
Trackin' choppers in the highway patrol
It ain't right, but it's white and it's right
And I know once I get there that it's sold
I'm just prayin' you'll protect me on this road
While I get this dough
And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at
And I always find, Yeah, I always find, Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Run away fast as you can
Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away
Just run away
...I got a plan
Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away
Why can't she just run away?
Baby, I got a plan
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, they wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes wit' a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me
I'm guessin' you're at an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day you just up and leave
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Let's talk this payola (Payola)
You killed God's baby when it wasn't his will
And blood spill, we can't talk this shit over (This shit over)
The Lord is my shepherd, I am not sheep
I bring my offerin', I will not preach
Awaken my demons, you can hear that man screaming
Santería (Santería, Santería, Santería)
Triple back, they rush in like Soviets (Soviets)
At the Kremlin
Searchin' for the green like a Gremlin, presidential emblem
Presidential tint on this shit that I am driven in (Woo!)
I just place orders and drop dollars
Seen all the wrong moves, watchin' The Untouchables
We don't do vegetables, niggas get flatlined
Welcome all beef, then we heat 'em with flat irons
Your plans are backfiring, think of double-crossin' a priest
Hail Mary, repeat after me
Ya te vas a la mañana (Mañana)
Ha-ah, los ángeles te esperarán
Es el fuego que yo—conozco
Es el fuego que yo—
Ya te vas a la mañana (Mañana)
Es el fuego que yo—conozco
Es el fuego que yo—
Of all the things I've ever paid for
Know that it's no price tag when I wage war
It's no more to pray for, niggas get preyed on
Darken my doorstep, they told me the day's gone
You listenin', De'Von?
As I'm talkin' to your spirit, for God's sakes
I'm dealin' with heartbreak
Checkin' my ego, I'm livin' with lost faith
I'm backin' this hit, nigga, you ever seen Shark Tank?
I paid 'em in small bills, all of 'em small face
I bet when we draw blood, you niggas will draw a blank
Dress you in all black, partnered with All Saints
Our numbers is all facts, my shooters give all thanks
And all praise, no jail bars can save
Leave you like Malcolm where X marks your grave
Hey, it's probably better this way
It's cheaper when the chaplain prays
Santería!
Ya te vas a la mañana (Mañana)
Es el fuego que yo—conozco

The Lord is my shepherd, I am not sheep
I am just a short stone's throw from the streets
I bring my offerin', I will not preach
Awaken my demons, you can hear that man screaming
Santería (Santería, Santería, Santería)
They say that death comes in threes, how appropriate ('Propriate)
Triple back, they rush in like Soviets (Soviets)
At the Kremlin
Searchin' for the green like a Gremlin, presidential emblem
Presidential tint on this shit that I am driven in (Woo!)
Rottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock hollers
The three of y'all too accessible
Welcome all beef, then we heat 'em with flat irons
Your plans are backfiring, think of double-crossin' a priest
Hail Mary, repeat after me
Sacred stories of home, they know

Grab the baking soda homie (Evidence!)
Huh, huh (why?)
I’mma show them how to whip it up for Ricky dia!
(Scared money, scared money, scared money, sacred money)
Scared money don’t make no money, (Uh huh)
Scared money don’t make no money, (Uh huh)
If I ever go broke, I’mma take yo money
I’m on my northside Philly shit, southside furious
That boy and his bag and that boy is serious
Two chicks give me head on they periods
Make them run threesomes, ‘cus they a little curious
Have my niggas in your crib when you waking up…
Lil N.O.R.E’s a shooter, I don’t miss my target (target)
And fuck it I’m a rider
Magnum strapped tight, so I’m bustin’ all insider her
Nobody dies a virgin, life fucks us all
I was born poor, but was raised to ball
I’m a grown man, pay my own bills
Great Adventure money, I pay my own thrills
Scared money don’t make no money
Scared money don’t make no money
Scared money don’t make no money
If I ever go broke, I’mma take yo money
Scared money don’t make no money
Scared money don’t make no money
(We goin’ be fine, ha ha)
Yeah
You ain’t really gotta ask where it came from
Caught fire with the brick, made a dollar off the strip
Used to gamble with three dice, four fify six dream
Ran from the Po lights, thank God for the six speed
If you scared then you better get a dog nigga
If I ever go broke, I’mma take yo money
Have my nigga snatch yo bitch and rape yo honey
Papi said he got that work just bring them Pesos for me (the money)
As a youngin’ I used to be the lookout
Now we in the kitchen with pigeons having a cookout
Niggas gettin’ took in, niggas gettin’ took out
Used to drive Chargers now they foreign when I pullout
Maserati, Panamera’s, big Ghost’s
Team of killers, long clips, big toasters
Fuck around they buck you down, get chauffeured
Nice casket talking past’s, big hearses, ha!
Lyrics from Snippet
The Franklin Saint that broke the bank
I owe my ties, the check is blank
Who are you to question how I show thanks?
We don't pray to the same God, wager the same odds
My Saint Tropez don't relate to your Saint odds
Three or four rappers are sharin' the same lies
Mirror my excellence for me is exercise
Feelin' like exodus, tryna get next to God
This is an exorcist, see through to my ex's eyes
Hopin' my ex forgive all of my extra lies (Woo)
Life goes on and babies born
Bring the noise (Bring the noise)
Louder
These niggas' heads is too light (Yah)
Take that (Yes)
Put the Fear of God in these niggas, Pusha
It's like the changin' of the guards
We changin' out the frauds
I gave these lions heart like my name ended in Oz
Long time comin', Sam Cookin' up these bars
Still Eddy Caning, see the fiends sunk in jaws (Yiuuck)
Push a ton, pledge allegiance to the raw
Known dope dealer that escaped without a scar (Yess)
I'm Buddy Lee, so lucky me, see I’m home
Wish I could jailbreak my team like an iPhone (Wooo)
Squilly told me take this motherfucker by storm
So as I embark, this where begin start
I write my own happy endin', nigga pen sharp
My life’s a Kodak moment, I need a frame for it
The Penthouse’s daybed needs a crane for it
I'm fuckin' on it, exotic bitch from out the rain forest
So many bitches it's a blur, I take the blame for it (Wooo)
God in heaven knows what I feel inside
Responsible for all this inner-city genocide
I'll be damned if I let Yale campus vilify
As I uplift this art form ceilin' high
I can't identify with your one death
We lose thousands over here, you speakin' one breath
Outsiders lookin' in like using one ref
My zip cam point of view to you is one step
Closer to clarity, not a parody
How cocaine single-handedly carried me (It's just my life)
I just shake it off, then I shake a leg
A lot of time to make up is what Jacob said (Welcome home, baby)
The fans fell for your act, I tell you break a leg
Then guns shots goin' off that’ll awake the dead
The only thing missin' is seven dwarves
Funny, Snow White sprinkled all through my repertoire
Pissin' the devil off so much I shovel off
They hopin' I level off, escalator-climb on you niggas
Uh, white gloves and a powdered face
Single-edge razor, Gemstars on powdered plates
The winter coupe hibernates, here's where I dominate
Bitches get over, dog, can't limit the protocol
Don't turn your motors off 'cause niggas' motives are on
Rich nigga shit
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talkin' to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But, sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!
Say you got to hang up but that man won't let go
Now we speakin' on some niggas that he say he ain't know
Graduated, gettin' money on the same blocks
But things changed and we ain't end up in the same box
Givin' you the jailhouse talk but you ain't mad enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standin' up
I never thought I'd had have to question, 'Were you man enough?'
Long letters how the streets got the best of you
Yeah, see I can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I gotta press 5
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are lookin' through me, can't you hear it in my tone?
So, then sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!
Got me tiptoeing through the conversation on our calls
Tryna act normal but the writin's on the walls
But I just let it ride so I don't be the next to fall
"They sayin' Terrion been getting money while I'm gone
And won't he tryna to holla at my bitch when I was home"
"Nah, he selling cars, it'd be him and Lil Rome"
I'm just tryna offset what he was sayin' on my phone
Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointin' fingers like pallbearers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
Might as well have a robe and gavel like Your Honor
I just sit and wonder, play it by the numbers
When you ride like lightnin' then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mama, she ain't even know if she should speak
What the fuck is there to say knowing her king's now weak sayin'
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Well, the walls are talkin' to me and I know you think I'm wrong
Let's talk real niggas, let's speak real, nigga
How many niggas you knew snitchin' you ain't killed, nigga?
We had a legacy he killed, I got to wear that
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't stare back
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one that set in motion all them undercovers
Called my mom mother, was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal you was my motivation
Uh, from great friends now it's no affiliation
Divided by the time he was facin', once he told me that
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
Sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home
I think the Feds are looking through me, can't you hear it in my tone?
So, then sorry, nigga, I'm tryna come home, hey!
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot (D-D-D-ing up)
She AP and really eat a nigga's watch (D-ing up the spot)
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot
Call the bitch Swiffer 'cause all she know is swipers
Fuck a rap nigga, but she don't need him to wife her
(D-D-D-ing up the spot)
Travel out to them islands in Thailand
She don't know if it's Lanvin or Lanvin
All she want is the monograms and my bands
(Yo, what, what is charcuteries?)
(Man, it's, it's when you go to your hotel room)
(And they got the cheese and the fucking pepperoni)
(Sliced on a little wood board, waiting on you)
New taste levels, shit, she be schooling me (Nigga)
I got a bitch that'll master your card
Every page inked up, her and the bitches link up
They think they hear the drum and the machine when it syncs up
Heads boppin', boop-bopty-boop-bop
Bustin' down watches
Rental whips in the garages
She don't trick, but she charges
Lotta double Cs, double Gs (You know how I do it)
The dual exhaust is double Vs (You know how I do it)
You niggas talk, she fuckin' me
But she just worry 'bout who got the purse first
I tried to tell her, "Go to real estate school"
She say, "Don't you see these fucking dealer plates, fool?
You know the rush it is to know bitches hate you
I got a bitch that'll master your card
Nice with the Visas, passports is art
Every page inked up, her and the bitches link up
They think they hear the drum and the machine when it syncs up
Heads boppin', boop-bopty-boop-bop
Who you think showed you that Chanel did the tube socks?
Bustin' down watches
Rental whips in the garages
She don't trick but she charges
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot
My bitch hot, like she D-ing up the spot (D-D-D-ing up–)
She AP and really eat a nigga's watch (D-ing up the spot)
My bitch hot like she D-ing up the spot (D-D)
I see you supplying the strip
These niggas been fiendin' for this shit
Push!
In one short year, I've turned dreams to nightmares (Hah)
Let the gods of the game know I'm right here (Bangladesh)
To you new muthafuckas, Buzz Lightyears
Ahead of y'all, so be careful on that tightrope (Yeahh)
I inspire all the rappers that you might quote (What?)
Lookin' down on you niggas like white folks (Haha)
You're entitled to believe all your high hopes (Uh huh)
When you can fool anybody with the right hoax (Who run it?)
Let you sing to 'em, emotionally cling to 'em
With no pillow, you just sellin' a dream to 'em (Wake up, niggas)
I just laugh at 'em, fuck is he doin'? (Hahaha)
I just wanna flip it (Hah)
I just wanna sell it (Hah)
I just wanna flip it (Hah)
I just wanna sell it (Yeahh)
I just wanna flip it (Yeahh)
I just wanna sell it (Yeahhh)
It's so obvious in my clothes you could smell it
Powder everywhere, like I drug the chalk through it (Forty racks in my pocket)
Hit the jackpot; bulls-eye, dart through it
Music; I talk through it, it's an art to it (Tell your bitch to come in)
Let the critics praise, let the charts do it
80 cents could save a child, but I ain't opt to it
I just shop through it; cook and chop to it
We got our own thing; drop the top to it (Wooo)
This is block music; Waka Flock to it (Push)
I just wanna flip it
I just wanna sell it (Yeahh)
I just wanna flip it (Flip it)
I just wanna sell it (Sell it)
It's so obvious in my clothes you could smell it
I'm so raw, runnin' from the law
Here to raise the bar; chain, no flaws
Say it's whiplash when I let my neck thaw
In that two-door, no rims on the car
See what I saw, the best gettin' better (Dope man, dope man)
Look, but can't touch; I'm a muthafuckin' leper
K-I-L; I'm just waiting on a letter
Oh, there it is; let the triple beam measure
Re-Up is the gang and we bettin' whatever (Yeahhh)
I just wanna flip it (Push)
I just wanna sell it
I just wanna flip it (Hah)
I just wanna sell it (Hah)
I just wanna flip it (Yeahh)
I just wanna sell it (What?)

Price for the 20 all i need to know
Still moving snow like it's 3 below
Detroit's hard, while I Cape Cod
You niggers little bees to the base guard
I've been cooking, is you mistooking?
Shot town plug got the city junking
Mad max 5 stacks before i look this weather
Small circle bad bitches all think they clever
The mix 1 whole shape and recycle better
Sit them on a curve when i'm done with them
She oblivious a girl wanna come with them
Can't blame off another niggers can't run with them
Around the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like wassup? wassup?
Everybody in my city show me love

Speakers going hammer, speakers going hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer
The dough boy version yeah
See i could tell you ain't gonna be around long

I wake up, early in the morning 'round the crack of dawn and
Wave to my neighbors like what's up?

Everybody in my city show me love
Because I have the speakers going hammer

Back up in this bitch niggas free to go

Small circle bad bitches all think they clever

Usain Bolt through these bitches then I'm done with 'em
So Liv
This guy had a Range Rover just like you
I said Range Rover where? This ain't no motherfuckin Range Rover
This a G55; 130 thousand dollars of winter throwaway money
You must be out your fucking mind
See I could tell you ain't gonna be around long
You ain't doing enough motherfucking homework on your nigga
Get it right
Ear drummers
Yeah, my success is their nightmares
Wide awake but the boogeyman is right here
Paid dues, I done earned every stripe here
Paid you just to get it on them flights, yeah
I am not the sequel to any of you people
We don't even share the same prequel
I am drug dealer, you a pill popper, credit card nigga
I am shotta
You niggas is opera, I am more blocks
All I wanna hear is choppa, choppa
Authenticity holds more weight than an Oscar
Emmy, really holds the semi, really sold Demi
More than these rappers with their ghost stories
It's a war outside no man is safe from
Where they pray I fall from grace from
Push
I came to G.O.O.D. Music with the checkered past
Some said I was finished, checkered flag
But like the LVs on this on this checkered bag
Yet Sean be youthful, tell Ye "Stay neutral"
While the president makes the company fruitful
I just wanna make my own dark, twisted, beautiful
Gotta factor in the powder under my cuticles
Still, if you lookin' for real, we don't stop at the yield
See, 'cause balling's a sport, take a look at my real
That's the 'Rari and Porsche, a quarter short of a mil'
See my name on the bill, naked bitch in the pill
Cop some L on the flight, let us smoke it with ills
The art of the hustle, still an ultimate thrill
The tenure of blowbama's a license to kill, yeah
Yeah... I just ordered one, my nigga
Yeah...
I’m still a snow mover, blow harder than tuba
Designated shooters, turn weed to woolers
Condo in Atlanta, money counters like the NASDAQ
In that glass back, the motor is the ass crack
I’m still feeding divas like I feed the meter
Holy father to 'em, I ain’t talking Jesus neither
I’m just a name and a number with the means to reach ya
His army, MCM on gym sneakers
You knowin' that hymn better, he been preaching
You motherfuckers is bloodsuckers, you been leeching
Been Baller, been Jacob, been dealer
All killer, no filler, been iller
Fraud niggas, you Zoolander, Ben Stiller
When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way
Big difference between a renter and a homeowner
Lufthansa I heist, nigga, or that bitch Winona
Stop comparing me to rappers 'cause they in their moment
Might have crossed the name brand every blue
But these brand names to a brand owner isn't new
She ain't the angel that you think, she reincarnated too
I build mine off fed time and dope lines
You caught steam off headlines and co-signs
Young niggas cliquing up with my rivals
Like the Bible don't burn, like these bullets don't spiral
But a pawn’s only purpose is completely suicidal
I'm just talking to the world like it's you and I
When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way
Nothing but cash here, this sweater is cashmere
The roof is a translucent, it's nothing but glass there
The car is a concept, what's next is my last year
My future is bright hot, you never can last here
I'm top five, listen, who hot in the past year?
Five heartbeats and I'm feeling like Flash here
'Cause what I captured is the beast unleashed in the pasture
Telfair, tailor-made suits hand crafted
Over Bottega Veneta, high tops unfastened
S550 drop top is unimaginable
To my hand drop and then he unattached it
Practice it, niggam brick, break down, break dance
When it comes to shooters, my niggas is trained to go
And they gettin' practice on bitches who breaking codes
Thirty-five hundred, just point and give 'em a name
They back flipping niggas, that go for rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck out my way
I say hey, sunshine
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
Beyond spiritual 
I need a realer view
I hold a mirror to it
These ain’t new problems, they just old ways
I see one time turn sunshine into Freddie Gray
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
Not guilty, still I’m filthy
In FOX eyes, we the dark side
So they tell you lies
Through a TV, C-N-B-C
C-N-N, Don Lemon, no Kweli when you meet me
In order to be me
Brenda’s baby next door to the candy lady 
Same project as Candy Man where they still doing hand-in-hands
Sunday to Sunday, pastor only want one day
Grandma praying someday
But God can’t hear it over gun play 
Woo! Still a target, but the badge is the new noose
Yeah, we all see it, but cellphones ain’t enough proof
So we still lose
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hey, sunshine
Oh how the day can be so long
While they testing your patience, they just testing my reach
Funeral flowers, every 28 hours
Sworn to protect and serve, but who really got the power?
Looking over their allowances 
Building prisons where the mountains is
Laptops is for the county kids
They’ll never re-write this, like they re-wrote history
The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a goddamn mystery
And so it goes, every truth don’t get told
All these cops get cleared, and lives are stole
Every goose don’t lay gold whoa
Just another nigga dead, just another nigga dead
Send another to the FEDs, send another to the FEDs
Public Enemy, I am Chuck D
Flavor Flav in Louis V, but I’m Huey P
Woo! The new elite, it’s either you or me
Let the sunshine, cause their dark clouds try to ruin me
It’s more and more and more than Baltimore
Patience torn, patience gone, oh lord
I say hey, sunshine
I say hey, sunshine
Pissing the devil off, so much i shovel off
A nigga ice cold as I'm freezing my bezel off
Escalator climb on you niggas
White cloves and a powder face
Single edged razor gym stars on powder plates
The winter coupe hibernates, here's where i dominate
The longest running trapstar street niggas nominate
Over-all
Although watches get overhauled, bitches get over dogged
They say the snake is the closest Remember to mow the lawn
Rich Nigga shit!!!
Yeah!

Ten-room mansion with a lake in your backyard

Standin' on the corner with a Coolaid stand

Yes this is freestyle, LBC style, G style
I like to flip and dip
So you can ride and roll and get control
And lemme show you how I get cold
I might get, I might get lifted
I tripped it and dropped it
Never ever flopped it
I need to use the phone
Could you give a dogg a bone?
I'm leaning and everybody lookin at me screaming
They wanna get a picture of the D O dub
All the ladies in the hall love
Even the big boss, he wanna get a picture
Cause he know it don't cost
Big Snoop Dogg, I'mma start the show
Yeah, take a picture with me
In the middle, I'm on the side
Wiz on the left so you know how we ride
And when we came, we both got high
And they got mad and told us put it out cause "fire"
We just kept smoking and I took another hit
For Cosmic Kev, I said "cool I got a freestyle
And then I came in and dropped it for him"
Pushed record and popped it for him
Baby start filming it now
She got the camera, I got the rap
And he got the dippy-dippy scratch in the back
My music is dope, I never ever choke
And if I wasn't rapping I'd probably be broke
No I'm lying to y'all
It's only Big Snoop and I'm the Top Dogg
That means that I'm gonna get money
No matter what I'm doing it's sunny
It could be raining, I could be banging
You could be talking, I could be singing
I could be slanging, I could be bringing
You what you need, but I stop and proceed
It's big Snoop D O double to the G
Ease.. and when I'm done on the microphone, smell me
I'm just like the breeze
Power power, 99
Everything is oh so fine
I gotta say something cause these suckers got me so upset
I haven't won a Grammy yet
I haven't made a call to my granny yet
Cause when it comes to rap, you the only one
You don't need a Grammy, you got a Soul Train Award
And you keep smoking reefer, and these suckas is broke
But you can't touch me, cause I'm just cold
When it comes to the freestyle off the top of my brain
And I'm 40 years old, but it sounds like I'm 17
Cause when I be rocking, I'm oh so clean
And I'm on the hip-hop scene
Cause my rhyme is so clean...
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Snoop Dogg
Here we go
Nigga, understand, West Coast Son of Sam
'Cause that ain't shit to a real Crip, cuz
You'll swallow every clip before a nigga slip, cuz
LBC, yeah, we gets love
213, rest in peace, Nate
It's real in the field, keep your cleats laced
Smoke a pound when I move around, yeah
The world is my lounge chair
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Now I'm back getting another bag
Clocking the grip, never gon' slip, I put the "R" in Crip
C's up, G's up, B's up, aw
He's up, we's up, East up
Get a real woman, don't trust these slu-
And when you're around the cops don't say three much
Stopped drinking cause my liver act up
But now I bring back the savage like a rental
Gold and black flannel, grip gripping on a handle
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, countdown, 1
Snoop Dogg
Go crazy in this mothafucka right now
Go crazy in this bitch, mothafuckin' now
Go crazy in this bitch, right, right now
C-R-I-P, y'all ain't gon ever see a G like me again
So get a glimpse of a winner
A rich Crip, shit can get-a
Swizzy the countdown
I'm sittin' in a over crowded tank
Cause if it's me, it's on (Sup, homie)
Loc, the Ese wit the black knights just got stole on
And he fell to the ground
It's not a jack for his scratch nor his shoes
One point for the black guys
They rolled him up, swelled and belled
He still alive so he know what's next
Any nigga they catch slippin' they gon' put him to rest
So I made my best to protect my chest
On point all night cause if I sleep I might
Not make it in this world of fools
I might come up missin' if I'm slippin' in these County Blues
1 - Niggas fuck around in they County Blues
You might come up missin', if you snooze you lose
Why? Cause it's this is gangbangology
See the first verse got'cho ass scared
But hold up, you gotta take a trip upstairs
Where the fools always wonderin?
Young nigga, welcome (welcome)
I be "God damn nigga, what'chu gon' do?"
Stay down for yo grits cause he who slips, gets licked
And stuck, fucked and all that
Put him on a killer row, where the killers kill and disregard
Say you don't gang-bang
Well why your homie - baby boo callin you by ya gang name? (Sup nigga?)
But damn, the Ese's is deep
And it look like they straght tryna creep, you peep?
Creep like T-L, on the D-L
But you fail, tryna tell Deputy Bell
Well, that shit was disrespectful, nigga
That's what'chu got checked for, and deck for
Nigga you'se a ho (you'se a ho)
Uhh, and I'mma let you know (let you know)
I mean, niggas is bitches, when they get behind the wall
But I ain't talkin 'bout all y'all
Cause I know some niggas from the C-P-T
And some big homie's from the L-B-C and South Central
Repeat 1
{*singer's sings until fade*}
Yo, uh, yeah
Doggy Dogg back in the muthafuckin' house
But this time I'mma get on the realistic tip
Take you niggas on a trip through the county jail
You know what I'm sayin'?
But if you haven't-
I'm tryna see which nigga these niggas plottin' to gang
Note, the ese with the black Nikes just got stole on
And he done fell to the ground
The deputies ain't around so he finna get the beatdown
They takin' his moneybag, now they takin' his shoes
A quick come up for the black guys
Now he's callin' for some help, see?
But when you at it like this every man for himself G
Especially if you're black as me
Watch ya back for the niggas, the Mexicans, and the crackas, G
Ain't no love jumpin' off
I done seen some of the biggest OGs get tossed
You think I'm lying?
Well take a trip, Mr. Hardass Muthafuckin' Gangsta Crip
Get shackled up to spend a whole week in 43
But if you don't bang, peep the ruse
Straight up, you know what I'm sayin'
It ain't like you can't go nigga
But when ya go it's like you on death row
So if you got warrants you little busta-ass nigga
You might as well pay them muthafuckas off beore you get baffled
You understand what I'm sayin'?
I see the first verse gotcho' ass scared
But hol' up you gotta take a trip upstairs
Young nigga, welcome to 95-hundred
Confronted every second about where ya from
Who ya slang with, and who ya bang with
And don't try to lie like you don't bang
Cause here come one of ya homies callin' ya by ya street name
Now you sittin' on a roof just freezin' like an icicle
Oh shit, here we go another squabble
But this time the eses is deep
The niggas gettin' beat so ya creep
Straight to the deputy
That was disrespectful
Busta-ass punk, bitch-made nigga you be livin' in a trunk
Ya catch the county blues
Straight up
I got hoes, I got cars, I got this, man I'm the ballif'
Man you ain't gotta business since you been in this muthafucka
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Nigga the county jail ain't no muthafuckin' joke nigga
I'mma break this shit down for y'all
Could really hear what I'm sayin'
My message was smooth and direct G
You betta check yaself before ya wreck yaself
Cause Doggy Dogg is a muthafuckin' hog
While ya slippin' ya get somethin' shanked in ya back
By me or one of my BGs
And busta-ass niggas don't really wanna see me
In or out of the facility
Don't come like bitch
You tried to play hard but we found out youse a snitch
Tellin' on niggas to get out quick
Shoved up ya muthafuckin' guts
Now youse a fag gettin' paid to like nuts
Droppin' dimes on fools
You got fucked in the asshole
Wearin' county blues
Never fails
County Jail
Hang a nigga out to dry, you know what I'm sayin'?

20 homies 2 minutes gangbang overload
Wanna be a gangsta well this the first step
Choose who you wanna cruise with, that's your birth set
Now get you some heat and learn to merk back
No rats and cat naps where you work at, for real
My family, they chose the shield
But me, I'm a Dub with the Pittsburgh Steel
Slang drugs with them thugs that'll split your grill
LBC and C is bout as big as it can possible be, on me, we
E-A-S-T-S-I-D-E, C-R-I-to the P, I is he
Gangstas, ridas and we get busy
Patch on my eye like Spuds McKenzie
Strike up on the wall where your homies and friends be
You cannot have the crown without the cross
I'm talkin about somewhere in your life there is a cross
That drives you to the Father
Ladies and gentlemen
I know, I know that it's coming
A blessing is coming my way, yeah
Not comin in houses
Worth more than silver and gold, yeah
Even when the world thinks it's a joke
Churches talkin' holy, but no ghost
People dyin', steady losing hope
Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
Then no one can be against us
So i'mma keep running this race, yeah
And nobody killing my faith, yeah
Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
When I get to heaven I'mma say Amen
Say Amen, yeah
Grab my crown and run and dance
Praise him 'cause I made it in
Made it in
Yessir
When I get to heaven i'mma say Amen
Say amen
'cause one day, one day
One day, one day
I'm gonna wear my crown
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day

So, so many people so cold
'cause they don't really know ya'
Oh thank you Lord
Standing hollerin' God we trust
But do they really love ya'? (do they, do they)
Connected by the truth that hurts us right now
Pray for the path that keeps shutting me down
Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
Then no one can be against us
And nobody killing my faith, yeah
Tell if God be for us (oh yeah, yeah)
Woah I can't wait to see your face, yeah
When I get to heaven i'mma say Amen

Something we can not see
So far gone, that's come blind to our eyes
Intro:
G shit, LBC shit, remember how it used to be?
Mmm, you remember so much
(Verse 1)
1982 now what was I to do
All I wanna do is claim RTC
Cuz all of my homies from ICG
So we gon do this thang for tha LBC
On my eleven gettin slicker
Buyin liquor from a non-liquor store
Quick to dick a ho and get tha big homie for a 64
He ain't gon miss it though
Cuz I'm too slick for him to notice it was gone
Now he's tryin to take my dome
Hangin out all in front of my home
Now it's really on
Cuz I'm a dome this nigga and get him for his shit
Now his bitch is my bitch
Ain't that a trip how I'm a crip
But I won't hesitate to test another rep
And by tha time I'm 17 if I ain't in tha pen
Ridin, hoo-bangin like Mack 10
Back on tha streets again and strapped in
I'm lookin for tha niggas wit tha wrong fingas up
Nigga I don't give a fuck, nigga I don't give a fuck em
Straight bang, bang, bang, bangin, bangin
Chorus:
Shoot em up, shoot em up bang bang
It's all fair in tha gang bang
X2

I mean will like livin it up, you know
Bang to tha boogie and boogie to tha bang
Tha sound of mi nina when she feel tha need to sang
(Verse 2)
I got a gang of bitches who ride for me now
Not to mention tha homeboys locked down in tha p now
See now tha road get shaky but you can't break
Watch out for them hoodrats, snakes
Cuz E told me a little story that left me kinda hurt
The lil homie did too much dirt and got worked
Now he's on the run and dyin of thirst
Stayin at his girls spot on 21st
And when he gets snitched on that ain't tha worst
Cuz he might not make it to tha last verse
But meanwhile back in tha p now
Straight hoo-bangin and slangin cigarettes
I shank ya baby brotha just to get a rep
*Chorus  x4
(Verse 3)
This is Dogg Pound for life

Musta thought we was bustas or sumthin
I drop two niggas I don't need you niggas
Thats tha one thang I learned about tha gang bang

Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Huh, it's like that that there
They love it when I let down my hair
From Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson
Even Jessica Biel wanna know how I feel
So I let 'em all come to my back table
Roll up and lick the paper if they able
Bottles of everything, models and everything
Cocaine castles, I ain't sniffin'
But baby that plate in that one movie is trippin'
So, I invite her over to my party
Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie
No autographs, I ain't signin' now
Act like you been around a boss, bitch settle down
My life is like one big highlight
Welcome to the motherfuckin' Hollywood night life
Every night I'm in the limo, Excursion
With some whites, some asians and persians
They flirtin', and I'm certain they suckin'
One night with the Dogg and it's curtains
She say she wanna be an actress
Take one, take two, now cut
Now turn around, and let the homie Damani fuck
Huh, yeah, here we go again
I gotta go behind the club just to get in
They say I'm just too much commotion
All the yellin' and screamin' and pushin', oh yes I got 'em open
I'm in the back of the club gettin' a backrub
Smokin' with one of the Marley's, "One Love"
I'm higher than gas, refusin' to pass
Hollywood Night School my nigga join my class, c'mon
Meet me at the Roosevelt, bass cabana room
I'm on Sunset (where you at?) at The House of Blues
I just stepped in for a quick cameo
Me and Leonardo DiCaprio
Oh the life, night after night, flight after flight
Will have a nigga burnt out, some hoes turned out
You know it's pimpin' when you see the Dogg permed out
Cameras flashin', police passin'
Every little model wanna give me some action
So I let 'em kick it, then I let 'em lick it
Get some m_nage, durin' every visit
I wouldn't leave it, even if they paid me
The L.B. raised me and Hollywood is crazy
Father, we pray this morning for the spirit of wisdom and revelation, and the knowledge of Jesus Christ
We thank You and we pray for the sick, the shut-in
We pray for the young people, we pray for the babies
We pray for everyone that's sick this morning
Everyone that's lost this morning
In the name of Jesus, we thank You
Hallelujah, we thank You for Your love, we thank You for Your power, thank You
Satan, the Lord rebuke you
Satan, the Lord rebuke you
Satan, the Lord rebuke you
He's defeated again
Changed my hustle to witness
Gave me a brand new message -
Gave me a brand new song
So now I can't be threatened
By the drama and the tricks you bring
For I will not be defeated -
(Satan)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Oh Satan)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Satan, the Lord Rebuke you)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Ooh, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Ooh, Satan the Lord rebuke ya')
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (You are defeated)
He's defeated again. (again - listen)
Open your ears - open your eyes
Everything you're trying to do
(or we will) never gain and introduce to you. (oh my)
The enemy promised (enemy, he promised) said he promised
He'll steal and destroy
But the Bible says, no weapon formed against me
Will prosper or take my joy!
My joy!
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Wooh! Satan, the Lord rebuke you.)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Hah, Ooh, Satan)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Rebuke you - yeah)
He's defeated again. (Defeated wooh - everybody sing)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (He is)
Satan, the Lord rebuke you. (Yo Snoop, y'all break it down for me)
He's defeated (Can I get a real witness in here)
He's defeated (I need a few of the holies to open your mouth and say it with me - oh!)
He's defeated (I don't fear the terror by night)
He's defeated (Nor do I fear the arrow by day, uh huh)
He's defeated (Jesus made me a promise)
He's defeated (He has all power in His hand)
He's defeated again!
(Oh Lord, we rebuke the devourer and deceiver...)

Pedicure on my feet
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town
Aiyyo Jaz, tell 'em how I put it down
Is it the way you look? Is it the way you walk?
Is it the way you cook? Is it the way you talk?
No playtime in the daytime making love
Kids go to school, we can act a fool
Skinny dip in the pool, do it real smooth
Miss Bow Wow, queen of the town
Aiyyo Jaz, tell 'em how I put it down
Ooooooohhhh
Got me saying things I don't understand
Ladies, if your man make you say
(Got me speaking different languages [reversed])
Ladies, if your man make you say
(Got me speaking different languages [reversed])
He's here to stay, he's here to stay
This my plan, you my girl, I'm your man
Take your pain, take my hand, take my name
Ain't no game, show no shame
If I'm the boss, boss lady must be your name
So I got you, got 212
Put your face on my back, brand new tattoo
20 years in the game, what love won't do
A lot of women want me but I want you
You look cute when you smile, so I renewed our vows
It might happen to you
What gotten to me, shit I gotten to you
And start rapping 'bout things like love and being true
Now maybe we can make another baby or two
(Got me speaking different languages [reversed])
You make me say (Got me speaking different languages [reversed]) [x2]

It ain't shit like ridin' wit my niggas, watchin the world time
It ain't nothin' but a thang to a youngster
It wouldn't be the same if the paper wasn't amongst us
I used to wonder what the funk was
The Bigg Homie said 'Give em what they want cuz'
I can't remember gettin high as a muthafucker
Walking by not saying hi to muthafuckers
Little mama told me, don't get it wrong its the truth, but I
Prefer to have a nigga like Soopafly
Believe me I'm goin all out
And niggas trip when they see me up at Dogg House
And every time the Bigg Homie comes through they rush
Dogg House America {ooohhh}
Dogg House America {Dogg House America}
My home {my home}, sweet home {hoooommme}
Uh, like get ready for the park and jack move
Mama said super-tech the funk, back shoes
The white groove, S dot A dot SHOES
A nigga like moos best not make that move
Unless, you rockin wit the Dogg House best
Many hate it but at least they strapped wit heat
They make it false tabloid, you froze back
Thinkin they can fuck around wit the cost of the town
They love to boogie, uh
One tough cookie chocolate chip dip
Wit the rockin this bitch hit top wit this hip-hop
And it don't stop (don't stop)
I make a lady go damn near crazy, I wanna treat ya lazy
And when I'm finished wit your bitch I'm like get on baby
And look its no maybes, about the game I pack
Name on tracks, supa dupa came on back
O danger, niggas give me five minutes of fame
To show you why you should be use all kane, check it out
Oh I, Oh I (oohh I), (oohh I)
Oh I, Oh I (ooohhh wwoaahhhh)
You want the funk
I can see it moving takin over your soul
Over your soul (over your soul yyeaahh)
We got that funk
We see g'd up bumpin everywhere we go
It's the music gotcha feelin the groove (ooohhh clap your hands)
Clap your hands and make your body move (woooaaahhhoo)
Uh, Uh, we here to listen, ride and slide
And we doin the hip
Come along and ride wit this Dogg House mothership
My leg bone is connected to my knee bone
And my hip bone is connected to my big bone, your house
That Dogg House gangsta crew
It really makes you go
It really, it really, it really fights me to the brain
It really fights me to brain (wooaah, wooaah, wooaah)
This is goin out to you and you
In to each and every hood
Menacing, noooo
Don't plant your seeds in hollow ground
Is an elephant heavy?
Is pig pork?
And how did Snoop manage to keep beef off his fork
Speak with the folks and chief wit the loc's
Rob from the rich so I can give it to the broke
Open your isears and pass me a beer and bang this here
Sip on the corner we pop a did in the game
Dogg House motherfucker we, do the damn thing
And I am so cool
My sweet brand liberty

Uh, 2000 plus 2
Pyschadelically
Oohwee

Padelic that ass can you dig it?
Whenever I'm down and out I get back to myself
I roll a motherfucking fat bat to myself
Leave it to beaver, America gon' legalize but I ain't believe her
Til she finally did it
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg done did it
Gracefully gazing unto the sky
A lot of people smoke just to get by
But I see things much differently
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically
Put it in a letter so you let it be
One day we'll all agree and have peace up under a big chronic tree
And not have to answer to nobody
So let's go cuz
So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)
I blaze up soon as I raise up from out of my sleep
I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of police
I'll still blaze with ya, fire that ho up
I even put it in my food, I got a brownie recipe
You eat one piece man your ass'll be fucked up for six or seven hours or so
You don't like edibles? Then I got plenty of flowers to blow
Smoke it in the paper, cigar, a bong
Don't worry about the haters, just vibe to the song
And do it however you please, you please
Today's the day to smoke weed
So go ahead and blaze up
Today's the day to blaze up (Yeah, yeah ooh)
So go ahead and put your J's up (And smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (Get high)

Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she open
The best trees I be smoking

So she puts her back up on a pillow, uh huh
Two minutes later I'm bailin' out the hoes-pital
On my way to the liquor store
Dropped the O-E cause it's just too cold
Get myself some gin instead and then I stroll
But before I get out the door
The man behind the counter says hey, yo, yo
He picks me up and sit me on the seat
And then he grabbed the phone and get to dialin' the police
I wanna run but I can't walk yet
Can't grapple nothin' said, cause I can't talk yet
Cameras all around me as if I was a star
Mom's grabbed me, hugged me, and kissed me
This fool tried to twist me, mom's say she missed me (I missed you)
Re-group it, swoopin' in the coupe and
That's what I'mma name you cause boy you be snoopin'
Soon to be hoopin' hoes I be scoopin'
First piece of ass before I got my first whoopin'
Cookin', bookin', hookin' up with G's

Motherfucking Dr. Dre's on the piano
Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the vocals and I swing like soprano, ano
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg, he's on the mic, you understand it, yo
When I be growing, I be flowing with the gangsta shit
I don't be flowing with that punk-ass punk shit
And when I step into the house, I'm gonna hit you with the gangsta..fat hit
It just don't quit, like I told you
So let me have the microphone so I can slowly fold you
I told you, mold you, scold you like some water that's hot
Heat it, beat it, Snoop Dogg, you can't defeat it, delete it
I'm so smooth I don't have to dis you on the camera or the TV screen
I'm funky like some collard greens
I told you peoples, my sequels, they don't be bumping
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg, I'm down with D-R-E, see he's from Compton
And I'm from the L the O the N the G

Lets try the Deep Forest
I heard that was fly (yea, it is)
3! 2! 1! lets go!
Foot to the pedal and the pedal to the floor
Hurry up and take off, adjust my seat
Everything cool cause I'm dippin' to this beat
Slidin', slippin', smashin' off
I’m taking the lead while others crash the wall
Doggy D-O-double G in the (motherfucking) Gran Turismo 3
The coldest game, doin thangs
I'm picking up speed while I'm switchin' lanes
Doin' 'bout a 100 tryin' to reach two
My homie in the baby ('Bu), navy blue
Yea, it’s on! sittin' on Firestone
I'm tryin' to bring another checkered flag home
It feels bad in the worst way when you in last place But loc, I’m in 1st place
So how I’m gonna trip off that?
Cause if I lose I’m a turn it off and get right back
A whole new course, with tunnels and trees
Thanks for your support
I couldn't have made it without you
I doubt you ever seen a racing game this astounding
Picking you up when you’re down and
I drive good when the beat be poundin'
Knocking all across your face
In a whole nother place, a whole nother state
Sitting on chrome, actin' bad like that
On the real deal
Live from the Apricot Hill
I’m in hot pursuit
Being pursued by (hoes) that’s way too cute
Slipping out my lane, swerving trough the grass
Man these cars be on my...
Bumper jump up to three hundred, way cold
I’m doing too much I done lost control
Should I stop or should I roll?
My mission is to position my pole (position)
It’s all about winning! y'all know what’s up
Playstation 2 taking you to a whole new dimension
Where the cars look fly and they got good suspension
Did I mention it was tight though for real though
Your listening to the sounds of the D-O-G baby
Riding slippin', slidin'
(Damn) you in second gear? put it in third
And make sure you don’t hit those white lines by the curb
You wit your shuby do in the Subaru
Oh Lord I jumped in a dark blue Ford
Any claim that he in it to win it
Don’t trip, just make sure that you gonna finish 1st, 2nd, 3rd
That’s all that matters and I doubt there’s a racing game that’s phatter
For real though Gran Turismo for sho though
On the low tho, the game that’s for sho yo
Put your pedal to the metal
And ax all the kids in the ghetto
“Is the game hot, like the kettle?“
And I guarantee they all say, “Hello!?!”
Ride on, ride on, ride on
Doing bout two hundred
In the fast lane
Yeah, what’s the name of the game?
Gran Turismo for sho' yo on the low tho
Better ask somebody
For real yo Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo
Can we get a motherfuckin moment of silence
For the small chronic break?
A-hah, niggas be brown-nosing these hoes and shit
Taking bitches out to eat, and spending money on these hoes
Know what I'm saying?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have I never will
I tell a bitch like this:
You'll never go platinum!"
Hey Daz, give me a light nigga
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
Y'all niggas know who I am, y'all niggas tearin' up shit
But we got somethin' old, and somethin' new for y'all tonight
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
The Dogg Pound, and the fabulous Dramatics
It's like everywhere I lizzook
And everywhere I go
I'm hearing motherfuckers trying to steal my flow
But it ain't no thang, cause, see, my homie Coolio
Some of these niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
Seems you haven't learnt
Hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off so take off your clothes
And quit trying to spit at my motherfuckin' hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
And see where I'm coming from: it's still Eastside
Til I die. Why ask why?
As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-double G, Y
It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
Well if you give me 10 bitches then I'll fuck all 10
Seen the homie Snoop Doggy sipping juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the set-trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packing flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that something?
Talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
1, 2, 3: you can't see me
A fuckin' menace, using hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, It's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
(All I ever did was just use that ho
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin' slugs
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin' hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it’s on, I’m head huntin'
Peep, the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' Tec-9’s for some action
It's a crazy, mixed-up world
It's a Doggy Dogg World
Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)
Til when? (Til the early morn')
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
For tha Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dough
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
Now I'm the mack daddy, had he not known about
The city where I'm from: Dum diddy dum
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D
The gangster clique
Now as the Pound break it down with the gangster funk
It's a crazy, mixed-up world
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
(Here ye, Here ye, Come one come all)
To a place that be, call it LBC
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
To a place that be, call it LBC
Now if you tired of the hard work
Tears and sweat
And you breakin' your neck
Walkin' round town all strapped in
Two strikes none left, out of breath
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo
All this deception on top of stress
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent
And now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent
It's a thin line, between yours and mine
The difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime
Now I know a place where
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline
(Here ye, Here ye, Come one come all)

Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!

Oh your homies think you're funny?
Doin' stick ups for moneys
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack
You got two strikes, but you right back up to bat
You all about yo' money and got something to sell
But if you bail for a robber you'll be back in the jail cell
Someone hated but baby without the homies and
That's when you got beat up
Because you can't be out there doin' low
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt
Somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt
But see, I know a place where
You might wanna be
And I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, We'll go right behind
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!

Stop the life it seem that we are on
Time to slow your roll
Let Doggyland be your new home
Stop the life you save may be your own
Time to slow your roll
Let Doggyland be your new home
Doggyland is the town where it's goin' diz-owne
(It's goin' down)
Everything is free
And ain't no HIV. (What?)
And niggas don't kill one another
(Oh really why is that?)
Because a brother is a brother
(And what about the mothers?)
Heaven must be like this
Green aroma like the grass in the summertime
I'm smarter than the senator
Bigger than the mayor
It's like a prayer
And you can't get in without yo' gold card you got
Now you know a place where
You gots to be and I took you there
Pop goes the nine, we'll go right behind
(Here ye, Here ye, Come one come all)
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaaand!!
To a place that be, call it LBC
Yeah, this is a story about a famous dog
Doggy Dogg that is
That smooth macadamian, a.k.a Silky Slim
Back in the motherfuckin' house for nine-trey
Why must he be like that?
Why would any other dog hit it from the back?
It's in his nature, it's Doggystyle baby
Doggystyle, it's Doggystyle
(Oh I, oh I) Yeah it's Doggystyle (oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh)
It's my first piece of ass and it's awfully tight
But I'm still finna handle my business like a dog
So lay back baby girl, and take a trip with me
I got the drink on deck, so take a sip with me
Drip with me, while I swing my thang
Reminiscing 'bout the first time Doggy Dogg came
It's time to take you motherfuckas down memory lane
(Memory lane, memory lane, Doggystyle)
(Down memory lane, Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (yeah) I (yeah, Doggystyle)
It was a hot sunny day in the month of May
I'm next door to the house with my homie J
Instead of being at school, I'd rather ditch and shit
Cause at one-forty-five I got a bitch to get with
With working my thang to get a bitch sprung
She glimpsing in the mirror and shit
'Cause once I'm in it from the back all I'm hearing and shit is
(I can see it)
I will do things to blow your socks off
(I can feel it)
Once you get near, the pussy gets clearer
A little something for the bitches that's down with me
Keep it low as you creep and get around with me
Don't be afraid like Aaron Hall
You know you want to fuck your nigga Doggy Dogg
Have you ever had your pearl tongue licked and shit?
While your nigga's in the county and you eating a dick
The position I'm fishing and wishing for
Is doing it Doggystyle, bitches blow
Oh I, oh I (oh yeah), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(Doggystyle, doing it Doggystyle) I (do it Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I (oh let me feel it), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(I can see it, I can see it) I
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(Doggystyle) I (Doing it Doggystyle)
Oh I, oh I, oh-o-o-o-oh (doing it Doggystyle), uh oh oh-o-oh I
Oh I, oh I (oh I want to feel it), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh I
(doing it Doggystyle, I want to do it)

Ayo, lil P
Tell them bitches to come sit right next to me
Yeah, gotta story to tell
And after that mac, mac I bought my first Cadillac
7-duece, 6 seat with the danglin' thangs
You can hang if you wanna but I don't think you can last
Last week in the beach, the big homie got smashed
Didn't say too much, all I heard was blasts
Ask no questions in this profession
You gotta view the game at your own discretion
It's a cold game, my niggas stop guessing
Do the right thing cause I ain't giving no lessons
Smokin' that stress got ya stressin'
Take that frown of yo' face and stick yo' chest in
Unless ya plan on restin'
Cause I'm the wrong nigga to be pressin' or testin'
I'm a east side nigga and I just don't care
I might change the game, go and cut my hair
You niggas say I'm back but I ain't went nowhere (he's back)
Hell yeah I'm there
At a crip clux clan meeting, family affair
Standing on stage, bout to do that there
I need to be the governor (yes ya can)
I keep a dark one, a light one, a fat one, a tight one
I'm always lookin' for the right one
Chinese, Japanese, Lebanese on ya knees
Shit you know me, I leave with either one of these
Vietnamese, Philippines, pick a niece, yo' niece
And will we still be homies
Nah I stay committed, forget it
Cause I know in the end you gon' wanna fight again
Green eyes, blue eyes, yo' eyes
Her eyes bring me the money, I'll just split the pita
Throw it in the oven, take my time and bake it
It's amazin' how they act when you get naked
Can't take it
I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I need paper and that's no lie
Blaze my dough-dough until I die
I say I just can't take it
I just can't fake it
I just can't take it no more
I need (dough-dough) and that's no lie
I blaze that dough-dough until I die
What sweet sounds
Of Meech-a-rooni
Inside the dogg house
For the 2000 plus 2
I mean, you could put a chocolate wrap around that
And put a lighter on the end of it
Cause that's all foggy
I smell you Meech-a-rooni
Ugh
Alright, hand me my backwoods, here we go
Not bad meanin' bad but bad meanin' good
Time flies by with the boomin' system
Shot for my head, I popped back but I missed 'em
So I kept shootin' 'til I ran outta shots
Then I threw my gun at him and I ran up the block
For a disguise, east side niggas is back
Ain't heard your new shit 'cause you niggas is whack
I came to this party all by myself
But I won't leave by myself
They all come through, it's sorta like a rendezvous
I'm so true to this shit, never new to this shit

She belong to the gang, so you know that bitch chose
So cold, make a nigga freeze up, hoes down, nigga, G's up

I did a whole lotta gutta shit
But lookin' back at it, young loc, Cuz, I'm on some other shit
Intellectual, misdirectional
Correct yourself so you can avoid correctional facilities
Mental stability, validity
Everythin' you look at ain't what it appear to be
Compellin' you, sellin' you, I'm tellin' you this
See poppin' this shit is like knockin' a bitch

Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
It all goes back, to '85
I remember one night, after the Sugar Ray fight
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yessir
She was so vicious, lips so luscious
Suck a nigga dick and have it shinin like some dishes
Patricia, Patricia, she love the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now, she eat the dick up
Big bucks, no whammies
She lived in the Valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig out, her homegirl named Brandi
Now Brandi was a cute little thick bitch
She moved to the hood from the 2-0-6
And the pearls, and turnin out the neighborhood little girls
Hmm, and I seen that, so I peep the game
So I put her down, bottom bitch on my team
And we began makin, breakin bitches takin
Whatever we want, see she want with the fakin
And crack the little bitch, yeah she Jamaican
And let me beat it up, listenin to "One Love"
Off some jerk chicken, I got mo' bitches
Now I'm fuckin her sister it's gettin real suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't tell
And now they next door neighbor, Clarissa Bell
She been lookin at me, I think she wanna hit
But I'mma holla back, cause I'm on another bitch
He said, "Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch
And make her suck a dick and not get caught for the fuck of it?"
I called and look here, this what you do
Make the First Lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, cause he left fast
Well what do ya know, D-O-double-G
And I'm a young pimp, got a lot of growin left
And you's a young ho with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a ho in check, blowin us a train wreck
Yeah I might have to go in depth
See every little ho I met
I shot it in her face and it went "Ahhh"
My homeboy Charles
Went up in his sister, behind the garage
I was menace, I was freaky, I was sick
When y'all was tryin to hump, I was teachin them to suck dick
Always tryin to go up in a ho
Got caught tryin to fuck in school they asked me what I did it fo'
You know just what I told her?
I love pussy, and this dick is what I showed her
And now they threw me out, now I'm at the pad
I'm at a new school, way cool
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Walk up in the room and I bust a new bitch
I'm in some new tail, wanna holla back
But for now let me holla back Impala black
She's a 12th grader, in my science class
And I done seen the pussy, yeah boy I'm movin fast
Could claim a dame, or game her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give it up
Now what you gon' do, when they ask you
Is you gon' tell a lie, or you gon' keep it G
Or you gon' hold it all inside or you gon' tell on me?
It's just another day in Doggy Dogg's neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she on the loose
Now what it do, what it is
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
Bitches will be bitches as I smash in the Chevy
It's gettin, it's gettin kind of heavy
{*fades out*}
I'm in Junior High with a C+ grade
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade
I got to tell these niggas everyday don't shit
Cause where I'm at if you soft you lost
And to stay on course, you got to roll with force
In front of his building witht the rest of his friends
I give him a pound no I mean I shake his hand
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man
I go upstairs, I hug my mother
I kiss my sister and I punch my brother
I sit down on the bed to watch some TV

Four young brothers got shot in the street
The very next day while I'm off to class
My momma go to work cold bustin' her ass

So there in school I made a fool
With one and a half pair of pants, you ain't cool
Cause there's no dollars for nothing else

So now its time I got to do something

No sticks, no stems, no seeds ca-rum-pum-pum-pum
We puff on nothing but chron' like rum-pum-pum-pum
(mumbling)
Doh' rae me fah so la tee smoking on that Doh'!
It's just the way that I can't help myself when it comes to this Mary-Jane
It's just the way that it makes me feel when it comes inside!
Comes inside! In my mind!
(Inhale followed by coughing)
*inhales*
You know mothafuckers be doin' way way too mothafuckin' much
You know? That's real
Just like baby right here, she doin too much
And he actin' like it's his but you know it's not
Say he doin' too much, yeah nigga you doin' too much
And if that stuck-up bitch got the bar posted-up
Say she doin' too much, yeah baby you doin' too much
I gave my kinfolk the keys to my Suburb
I told em "Hit the side and slide and get the herb"
Forget about that nigga though (fuck that nigga)
Fuck that nigga yo
But I can't forget about him 'cause he taught me everything I know
Oh no Joe, walkin' down the wrong lane
Niggas like that (what), get things like they want it (damn)
Then fake the funk, doggonnit
Now loc, look at this predicament
You smoked out and can't be trusted, I can't kick it wit
Niggas like you, used to be in my crew
Goddamn, they don't make niggas like they used to
Now if you're doin' for your family and you can't stand it
'Cause you know these mothafuckers tryin' take advantage
And if your kinfolk broke and he smoke dope
And he need to catch a mothafuckin' different stroke
Say he doin too much, yeah Joey you doin too much
We parlay, parlay everyday DPG style
We might throw a pool party every once in a while
Now in fact we gon' do one this weekend
Let's see how many hoes me and my nigga Rose can weed in
I believe in, sharin' the cock
Also, I believe in comparin' the cock
'Cause she love the way I just beat up the pussy
Not just knee deep, she was totally deep
She blew a nigga socks off, got a nigga rocks off
Ooh wee, baby you's a freak
Put my homie up on game like a gangsta
Ain't that a trip? Now we in a twist
And he get his third strike wit no get back
Say he doin too much, yeah homey you doin too much
I'm livin' up in the hills, wine sippin' wit mills
I'm havin' major type of paper, I ain't trippin' off bills (still)
Show me some respect and accept my coolness
And don't mistake my kindness to mean I'm foolish
Use this as a warning, 'cause I'm startin'
To figure it's some niggas think I'm soft as Charmin
Pardon me, 'cause I ain't mad when you get bent
But I hate when fools mistake me for U.S. ?spray?
Friends and family, gettin' after me like repo
Eat, smoke, choke then want me to throw 'em a c-note
Callin' strays over nigga leadin' months gone
And only get to hit a cold shower
You fakin' like you're makin' more moves than Simpson
But frontin', pushin' buttons, doin nuttin' but sin
And when a nigga on yo' phone, runnin' up yo' bill
Tryin to tell some hoodrat bitch how he feel
You know he doin' too much, yeah nigga you doin' too much
And when your baby momma cryin' 'bout she need some milk
And you heard some other nigga did been at her tilt
That's real

But it ain't no thang cause see my nigga Coolio
Put me up on the game when I step through the do'
Ya know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
I hope ya get burnt, it seems ya havn't learnt

So put your gun away, run away, 'cause i'm back (why?)
Hit em up, get em up, spit em up, now
Tell me what's goin on
Lone for the break-up, so take off your clothes
And quit tryin to spit at my motherf**kin hoes
Seakin of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherf**kin paws
Y'alls, niggas, better recognize
Why ask why? As the world keeps spinning to the D-O-Double-G-Y
It's a crazy mixed up world, it's a Doggy Dogg World
It's a Doggy Dogg World, it's a Doggy Dogg World
The Dogg's World
Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll f**k all ten
See my homey Snoop Doggy sippin juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm fo' to set trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packin flavor like Life Savors
Ain't that somethin, talk shit and I'm dumpin
I had your whole f**kin block bumpin
Ya never find the bomb-a-rama then this Nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming through
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that strapped with hit hard tactics
A f**kin menace, usin hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin
(All I ever did was just use that hoe
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I'm dishin out blues, I'm upsetting like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name's often marked for catchin slugs
And I smoke weed for the f**k of it
Ruff and rugged shit, it's unexplanitory how I gets wicked
But it's manditory that I kick it
Check it, I'm runnin hoes in 94, now must I prove it
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm head huntin
Hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep, the massicre from a verbal assassin
Murderin with rhymes packin Tec-9's for some action
You can't do me, I'm goin out looney like O-Dog
Tha Dogg Pound rocks the party (all night long)
Tell when (till the early morn)
Diggity Daz out of the motherf**kin cut once mo'
I flip flop and serve hoes with a fat dick
Till I die I'm still screamin that (bitches ain't shit)
Now i'm the mack daddy, had he, not known about
The city where I'm from, dum diddy dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique
I can see and I can tell that's what the f**k you want
So I blaze up the chronic, so I can get high
Yo dogg, niggas always asking me
Niggas gon ask me
We ain't going nowhere nigga
And matter of fact, you actin foolish right now with all that shit you kick
Nigga everywhere I go niggas be actin foolish
I'm a rider, the first local stock pilot
I'm moving down to block D, me and my homies
The Dogg Pound would rock overseas, immense degrees
No bitch niggas in the circle
I told myself watch out for my family and health
Knowing the rules have chose to hang out with the dummies and fools
Old school Poda Dada that I knew from way back to school
Attitude shitty, kept it raw and gritty
Uncut, me and my dawgs fuckin it up
What up
Fuckin it up, fuckin it up for life nigga, Dogg Pound, ya heard
If I hear another nigga talking about what he gon do, to who
Now how the fuck you figure that we wasn't gon comeback
The D, the P, the G to C
Westcoast's finest and I'm a put that on me
See niggas been rappin but they ain't sayin shit
Nigga shut the fuck up, get off my dick
Chorus
Don't be foolish x2
Hook
You see you don't wanna fuck with us
Knowing how we throw it out, the sucka niggas want to imitate us
Yeah worry about your muthafuckin punk ass crew
And we keeps it gangsta fool, thats gangsta, keep it gangsta fool
Trip, we got more dough than rock up, more niggas to lock up
See because this world we live in is crazy, and the people they so sick
And when it comes to gun play, hell yeah we the quickest biach
And oh my momma and my daddy, grandpapa and my granny
Homeboy you can't fuck with this
Smooth when we come through
The DP when we come through the gangstas is in the house
And all you muthafuckin niggas and you muthafuckin bitches
Get a muthafuckin dick in your mouth
I'm a gangsta I thought you knew, G'd up, grey and blue
Dippin through on the coop, made you blue
We gangstas nigga, laid back thinkin I tell you how it is in the hood
Where all my homies at, straps in Cadillacs
Hittin switches like e'yday, livin like the G way like e'yday, DPG-C
Hook
Chorus x4
Just bullshittin man this dude done told me the Dogg Pound broke up
Wait till I catch that nigga, I'm a beat him down
Dogg Pound ain't gon never break up cause that's favorite group
They gon keep on commin out with albums
Wait till I catch this nigga, he lied to me
Wait till I catch that muthafucker
Shit man, don't be foolish
Don't be foolish, nigga
Don't be foolish nigga, don't be foolish nigga
I don’t want nobody fuckin’ with me in these streets, children
I don’t want nobody fuckin’ with me in these streets, cause
Ain’t nobody got time for that
Ain’t nobody got, Ain’t nobody got
Ain’t nobody got time for that
Real shit mane, no matter where you from
I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated
Grew up from the turf, love doin’ work, I’m affiliated
See I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood
All I bang is that crip shit, trip this
Put the hammer to your bisquick to your biscuit
Jam with the jelly sellin’ grams at the telly
If you really want it come and get it on the Dinnub
20 gang, for life, all my niggas locked down
It's a new game, Its a new day
We even got homies in Akron and OK-C
And I can’t stop and I won’t stop
I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated
See I’m real for my niggas, I kill for my niggas, I’m affiliated
Grew up from the turf, love doin’ work, I’m affiliated
See I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated
Shit
Pull up, get out, hood up, sit down
It is I, he, King, NFZ, so my throne, a no fly zone
To make sure they mail they’re check, fly down LAX
To see my big cuz, fuck y’all thought this shit was
Turn a couple corners, big homies’ll pull up on ya
Cuz say the money where the booth is
Go and show the motherfuckers where the truth is
Hold up cuz I do this, state to state face to face
Straight up G shit, 7 mile nigga with the 21 east clique
Love my neighbors, season floor seats Pistons and Lakers
I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated
See I’m real for my niggas, I kill for my niggas, I’m affiliated
Grew up from the turf, love doin’ work, I’m affiliated
See I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated
State to State, Oh
Grew up from the turf, love doin’ work, I’m affiliated
See I don’t hang in my hood but I bang in my hood, I’m affiliated
Yeah
Don't do it
Fell off into a party in the cpt
Niggas looking at me strange
But I'm up on the game
Shit, I feel the same way y'all feel
Nigga, f**k death row (ha ha)
I cut em loose, send em juice
With visine in their cup
Catch em slipping, all my homeys get em stuck
It's the tale of a whale locked in a cell
On the streets he was the heat cause 'cause had major mail
Hanging at the studio, splurging and thangs
Nigga f**king off money, saving them hoes
And bought me a white rolls
Living on wilshire in a penthouse suite
F**king bad bitches seven days a week
Colder than a motherf**ker but now I'm hot
I guess I'm balling now
Money falling down
I can hear them movie star bitches calling me now
Doggy dogg come and get with the pg
Mr. calvin broadus could you please come and see me
But I ain't tripping, I'm just dogg pound cripping
Talking big shit and in a bulletproof dipping
Make my own beats, so f**k y'all too
And I'm down with the niggas from the you know who
We get to the point
Blaze the joint
Step into the party and holla at everybody
As long as the gin get mixed with juice
And the five on the crap game gon hit with deuce
Shit niggas gon be niggas so nigga, nigga what
Just because I'm having paper don't mean f**k
I once was in the same predicament you was
Thinking to myself "damn should I kill 'cause? "
Two wrongs ain't right
And it started from a fist fight
I only got one life to live
I'm trying to see a grandfather with some grandkids
You dig?
I'm trying to live long like my hair
Put the shit down, like fred estaire
I want to share my world
But how the f**k can I share it
You look at mine and compare it
Man, it's a cold shame
Is try to come through with something new
Banging for you
So whatever you do, you like it or not
Because when your shit play out
My grandpappy once sat me in his lap and he said
"son get your money like that" (get your money, man)
I sit alone in the zone
Face of stone
Live the live of al capone
A don corleone
Casually casualties, fatalities
And all kind of funny looking niggas coming after me
Funny, it's got me dodging, dipping, slipping, and sliding
Eastside up, eastsiders cause we riding (eastside up)
I f**ks it up, like I always do
And that's a trick
I'm saying some shit
See it's an everyday thang
Communicating to y'all with the dogg pound slang
Back up in the house and we just don't stop
Call ya mama, f**k her fat, call the motherf**king cops
Uh, uh
Don't, fight the feelin'
Hey, let me see some more

Don't get better than this, I got no wet, no Kris
When I'm in a whip, man, I burn my rubber
A girl tried to pop my rubber (What?)
But one time I shot my lover, popped my lover
Pled insanity, said forgot I love her
So come check me out if you shop for brotha

Canopy bed, well I'm a mova
Goose pillow, double deuce, stain less

Hit up the motherfuckin' set when I dip
(Where you from?)
Dogg Pound motherfuckin' Gangsta Crip
Split wigs for a livin', everyday's Thanksgiving

We love to bang bang
And the rap game is just like the dope game
The minute you forget it - forget it, you bit it
But them niggas know when you ain't with it
That's when they get ignant'

Life will twist ya like a twista, get twisted with this
It seems it's on, but it's off, I keep missin' and shit
Lookin' dead at the chips, I blink, they dip
Life will twist ya like a twista, get twisted with this

Shit, we just a bunch of thug niggas, ex-drug dealers
The kind of gangsta ass niggas that your bitch love niggas
But don't do that to yourself cause I'ma tell ya

Now getcha ass in my way, I'm snatchin you up by your lil' briefs
Now rock twice and do your hand like this
If you not then stop representin this gangsta shit
So we bangs the clip, the main West G spot
Compton, Long Beach, S.E. Watts
Where niggas is more sick, more dumb, more gone
Trick, you know where I'm from, the War Zone
Don't stop, don't stop!
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop!
Damn, I still hear my mama voice
"Snoopy get your ass up and go outside and play!"
Hah, if she only knew what I was ‘bout to get off into
Bang!
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop being you, don’t stop being G
Egotistical, mystical, officially
Shuffle my feet to the beat with my heat in the stash
G in the bag with the C on the flag
We some real OGs baby
I was getting money in the 80’s daily
Niggas like me don’t never quit
And I still go hard on a bitch, ya bitch
You got to tell ‘em what it is, don’t play with the game
I love it when you call a bitch out of her name
Don’t you dare try to save that ho
I know that you like her but you can’t wife her
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop being real, don’t stop that rap
Don’t stop showing homies how to shake that trap
I mean I seen so much but I'm still in touch with it
I don’t stop ‘cause I know y’all gon’ fuck with it
We keep going full speed ahead with this
Niggas ain’t did the shit
We came through and peeled his bitch so quick
From the 80’s with a dope sack in my hand
To the 90’s with a DJ and a microphone stand
Can’t stop now, I’m in way too steep
Tech savvy with this cavy, come way too deep
Short dawg, Snoop Dogg, this for all my dogs
The ones who real in the streets, the ones who locked in the halls
Hall of fame with this game, legendary to y’all
Another 100 point game, now you can bury the ball
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don’t stop getting lit with the shit I spit
Don’t stop, won’t stop, this is all I know
From the uprock to the crack rock in the bowl
Don’t stop, fuck a cop for all the times I was jacked
I’m moving real weight, I mean hundreds of thous
Hundreds of pounds, green leaves
I made it out the motherfucking mean streets
And I still go back and touch the youth
I teach ‘em how to ball and I teach ‘em how to shoot
In the pursuit of my dreams, while recruiting my team
Teach ‘em how to rise to the top just like cream
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all
Don't stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop it, don’t stop
Don’t stop at all

And meet me at the hot spot and work that skirt
You know the blue one, the new one, girl you know the truth hurt
Heart beatin while I'm cheatin, trying to catch a nut
Bad little bitch got a nigga caught up
Got a nigga all out of bounds in West L.A

I say what's up Tamika boo, what's up with you
She said Mauseburg skandelous, nigga so fuck you
Some bitches be lyin (lyin), most bitches be tryin (tryin)
G'd up, boot up, to hit it and show

No baby I ain't with the bullshit
I been fuckin you for two weeks and I ain't seen no cashflow increase
You've been runnin your mouth, tellin your girls how I'm fuckin you
What I got in my house, the things I don't do for you
Better be careful cause your girls wanna come too
Gave Keisha her groove back, now I’m up in you
And did you tell Tamika
You's a cold thang, I told you keep it on the DL
And if I decide to hit it again it's at the motel
Work on my table and how holding my clientel
Damn do it hit the spot
As pretty as you is no more blessins for your trot
But I might for the sake of my swipe
If I hit this pussy you goin tell on me
(Don't tell)
When I get this pussy you goin tell on me
(Won't tell)
If I hit this pussy you can't tell on me
(Won't tell, don't tell, don't tell)
(Don't tell)
If I hit this pussy you can't tell on me
(Won't tell)
When I get this pussy you goin tell on me
(Don't tell, don't tell, won't tell)
Ain't no big deal until that ho squeals
Now I got to keep my fuckin woman from around that ho
Take a fuckin rubber everywhere that I go
Keep her from her family cause her cousin know
She say she fuckin Nate but she can't prove it though
Next time you can't come if you got a loud tongue
This time you act like a nigga who just did a crime
You got your ass busted now you facing time
The money's in the pack, it's on the drivers side
But nigga you was with it so when you be quiet
Even though this story is a fairy tail
Act like you that nigga bitch and please don't tell
If I hit this pussy you goin tell on me
(Don't tell)
(Won't tell)
If I hit this pussy you can't tell on me

Shit, fuck what you goin through and fuck what you stand for
Got big thangs, you know what I mean?
Big riches it's a blessin'
You know I'm from a crip gang, ain't it man?
Ain't afraid to let my nuts hang, ain't it man?
And smoke a lot of mary jane, ain't it man?
And I never been in love before, ain't it man?
You know I'm doing big things, ain't it man?
Twist up a swisha sweety put some foul in that bitch
Lets get wild
Lets get high
Come on, lets take a few hits
Sip some drink, count yo bank or do whatever you feel
Pop the top on yo lacker, is that a Snoopy deal?
It's got to be Monopoly it's how I play on this field
A quarterback with the sack, I got a team to build
A Dream to fill, scheme for mills, wheels and deals
Do how I feel, don't give a fuck how I feel
And that's for real
Pimpin' ain't easy, for sheezy, my neezy, cuff your breezy
And remember this nigga when you see me
You know I'm doing big things, ain't it man?
You know I'm from a crip gang, ain't it man?
Ain't afraid to let my nuts hang, ain't it man?
And I smoke a lot of mary jane, ain't it man?
I ain't thinking a pay cut, this beat is paper chaser
You work from 9 to 5, but I'mma keep a steady hustle
Yeah, we doin' big thangs, a nigga gotta have some muscle
Always keep it low, keepa ain't afraid to knuckle up
I'm just here to kick game, get on the mike, spit flames
Big Snoop Dog with Kokane, ain't a man
Catch me lookin' flossy, I done hooked up wit the boss and
Where he got his share of thrust is not my fault
I'm handsome enough without the clothes and the [?]
But I'm rough, bossin' up on all them hoes, think I'm a star
I hustle and I call it like I see it, can't sleep
I need some money, stressed out, I'm about to fight
Bite off that weed or somethin'
To make it happen is the mission that they send me to get wit
Not all fall out dawg house, I represent this
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine smack-dead in your face
The street value of that is what you dream to make
Run an illegal business,racketeerin
Smugglin,doin things from handin a gun,is what they fearin
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Murder's an everyday thang in the city
Where you gotta plot chips,jag robberies and do in its
Tanadian Nay,the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandahs and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck em till they all drop,circle round the block
Let em have it as soon as they come out
Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs,dope pealers and addicts
Youth behaviour is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements
Have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs
From coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount
I had no choice or remorse for time for puttin it down
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
Young crook keepin hook,nigga,shakin the spot
Look for help,you help yourself cos there's no handout
Since the city Long Beach is only G's and hoes
Trust,bust,be aware and I ain't ya curse
Cos the niggas that I dared to (?agank?) the first
Think I might be deceased 'fore I reach my calling
As long as I'm haulin my heat I'm stallin
I bring it to ya hard from the streets of life
Where niggas get rewarded to grief for strikes
And war story glory ain't worth the riskin
Real niggas still get a mob like respect
If you represent ya set,till ya bite the deck
Who I be?I'm the Dee,nigga check the file
Under G you will see not to sweat my style
I come through blastin', me as a Downtown Assassin
Mashin,may they rest in peace in they caskets
Shoot em down in front of Hassans
Should've known from the gate,who's the baddest?
For the murder of forty men
From the U-S-C,I shift ki's,a 120 plane rides
Multiplied by G's,87.3 million in a matter o'months
Big business and big dollars is all that I want
I blaze up to celebrate,new empire to make
Toast till we all die,till we burst and break
From knives to guns,from the rich to the slums
We ran outta dope,I don't think so son
From daylight to reach dark and all the clucks a'spark
From when I pick em off like darts
Stab em in they hearts
Make an example,what I said,ya end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like hogs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky till I die
All I ever want is to be left alone
Me myself,me my dope,me and my chrome
Got paid by cops and judges,I budge when I buzz
Nope, nope
Nope‚ nope
Do you like I do
Do you like I do
You stay on my phone‚ talking 'bout‚ "What happening?"
I said, "Bitch, I'm home‚ ain't nothing cracking"
I only wanna fuck with you when a nigga need a little head
I ain't in love with you, bitch, I ain't laying in your bed
You so annoying‚ bitch, you stay on my nerves
Ask where I'm going, bitch, that's not your concern
I let a bitch slide for a minute, but I'm right back on this pimping
That's why I do you like I do (All the time)
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
All they wanna do is suck dick
That's why I do you like I do (Ooh yeah)
Only want hoes that can get a grip
I see you at the club (VIP), had a little bad bitch meet
I said, girl, come on (Girl, come on), bitch, let's do a little three
But you just started tripping on a player
(Bitch don't wanna have fun)
Now you right back where you started from
(Bitch, stop looking so dumb)
You so annoying, bitch, you stay on my nerves
Ask where I'm going, bitch, that's not your concern
I called your boyfriend, he said this bih always tripping
Nope, nope
Nope, nope
Nope, nope
I do
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
All they wanna do is suck dick
That's why I do you like I do (Ooh yeah)
Only want hoes that can get a grip
Bitch don't get no daylight, do you like I do
Only see me late night when a nigga wanna screw
Bitch don't get no daylight, do you like I do
Dum-dum-diddy, a-dum-dum-diddy, oh, oh
I do you like I do ya
Dum-dum-diddy, a-dum-dum-diddy, oh
A-dum-dum-diddy, a-dum-dum-diddy, oh
A-dum-dum-diddy
That's why I continue to
Do you like I do (And that's all the time)
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
All they wanna do is suck dick
That's why I do you like I do (You better know it, girl)
Only want hoes that can get a grip
(I want the money, the money, the money, say what now)
Do you like I do (I do you like I do)
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
All they wanna do is suck dick
That's why I do you like I do (Here we go, I do you like I do)
Only want hoes that can get a grip
Y'all remember?
(Do y'all remember)
Wasn't no trippin', we all family
For once in a lifetime, here's your chance to be
Now dance for me
Like you did when you was a kid
It wasn't where you was from, it was where ya lived
I give, to the girls when they got up outta church
I gotta work, I'm tryna get some G's
What you scheme?
As the stars are gone
Now tha police, gettin' tricky
They sent 'em, we out
Undercover, to get me
Somehow, someway them muthafuckas missed me
While they nappin' I'm rappin', stackin'
And lookin' for them niggas on the move, that's jacking
Their deposits hot, but ya not
Prepare to shoot or get shot
Long as it's from me to you or you to me
Cause I'm a g from the old school
I squab from the shoulders, whole thangs over
Thinking a nigga young cause a nigga getting older
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhh
I keep a gat in my pants, just incase ya check
Aye, it ain't the love just cause he black
I'll put you on the map like that
Now, I'll give ya dap, if you's a real one
That kill for the right thang
Not for the wrong thang!
Grab [?]
And get ya gangbang on mane
And do it like they used to do on Soul Train
When I was a little bitty nigga from the city
There wasn't no killin', dealin', just happy feelin's
I'mma take it back to how it was
If you down wit' me can I get a right on cuz
(right on)
I keep a gat in my pants just in case ya checkin'
(6x)
Not just knee deep, she was going real deep when she went down on me
(3x)
Now I know I gots to get it cause I want it now I gots to have it
See this the West coast anthem
Now is that tragic?
If yo' set and my set, yo' hood and my hood
Nigga it's all to the good
That's how we do it in the 9-8
No playa hate
Just take some shades and regulate
And represent the Golden State
And get them muthafuckas swole in the face
I need bank, like Dre used to make
When NWA was in the muthafuckin' place
The case was dropped, Cristal was popped
Then the big Dogg got snatched by the cops
No longer will Dogg be given ya muthafuckin' props
I'm grown now, on my own now
For tryna play me in the paint like Shaq Diesel
See i'm a lil man wit' a big thang
But I'd rather make big change in the game
So for me and you or you and me
It really don't matter what ya say ya gonna do to me
Cause I'm a G from the old school
I squabble from the shoulders till the whole thangs over
Don't call me Snoopy
Think a nigga dumb cause a nigga gettin' older
I keep a gat in my pants just in case ya checkin'
(2x)
Not just knee deep, she was going real deep when she went down on me
Now sure sure sure you're broke sure sure sure you're having problems
Food stamps didn't come on time and the lights have been cut off
But look here
Here's a little something about a nigga like me
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker when I'm playing with my AK
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out
Now I'm that motherfucker y'all read about
This is my gang nigga No Limit
With the pow pow bang bang and your dead
And then we stamp that tank on your forehead
Everywhere we go they say "DAMN"
Them gangstas they be fucking up the program
And then you realize we dont care
We dont just say no we to busy saying yeah
To a kid looking up to me
Shit life ain't nothing but weed and money
Shit I'm that type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass
I dont give a fuck cause I keep selling
Gangsta gangsta, that's what the yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it, 'bout it
Bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that straight G shit
Gangsta gangsta, that's what the yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay 'bout it, 'bout it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what the selling
Bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that straight G shit
Some dope dealing some gang banging
We decide to roll a week deep
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, in you before you know
I had my double pointing at his window
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to [?]
Sweating all the bitches in the dazzy dukes
We couldn't no play from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Nav is you crazy
She was scared and it was showing
So we all said "FUCK YOU BITCH" and kept rolling
To the hood now we was 'fen to
Find something else to get into
Like some pussy or in fact
Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack
On a nigga cold nutting it off
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fucking with my tank dogs

Didn't know I was a cold-blooded gangsta
If you ain't ridin' wit us fool, we'll catch ya lata

Sprayed shots to the crowed, like a loaded pump
Keep this mothaf**ka jumpin' 'til they close it up

No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better
Break out the weed and the drank and chill out and get high
Got shit poppin' like always, you know, so enjoy
Ladies and homies all in the mix, it's time to chill
Sha-La-La brought the orange, with the zags and the blunts
Roll up some Bob Marley joints of some skunk, Daz with Thai
And Nate got a hundred piece
So we piece up properly on the O.Z
We in the zone bombed out feelin' good, ya know
Got the homegirls and homies from the hood, ya know
And it's a Long Beach thang where I was born and hung out
To all my players and hustlers and gangbangers, listen up
It's about time I kick a rhyme to fuck shit up
Now who throws shit?
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better
Now do the gangstas run this motherfucka? (Hell Yeah!)
Or do the ladies run this motherfucka? (Hell Yeah!)
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better
Now the party is bumpin', thumpin' back to back
And Daz on the turntables puttin' down a scratch (HA!)
I'm on the mic so I'mma bust me a rap
And I'mma dedicate this one to a pack of hoodrats
The Dogg Pound nation, locs and big posse
These is the peoples I see rockin' the party
Make a nigga wanna poplock on the flo'
And do the Boogaloo Shrimp and pimp the ho
I got to owe 'em my life cuz I'm a O.G
I got the love in the hood cuz I'm the big homie
I got the skills when it comes to rockin rhymes
So put your hands up to the sky, get yours, I got mines
Now everything is live, don't you agree?
And if you do, then keep on groovin' with that nigga D-O-double-G
We ridin' with the hat to the side of the ride
Y'all know how we do on the Eastside
And we real party people just like Afrika Bambaataa
Cuz we keep it all on point from the drank to the joint
So pass the bottle, ain't no need to squabble
And hand it to the little homie, let him have a swallow
It's a Eastside thang, nigga, bring yo ass
G's up Ho's down, nigga, you know the program
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better
(What you watchin' the clock for?) The clock tickin'
But it won't stop kickin' cuz everybody kickin' it
And gettin at the bitches, which is, the main thing gangstas do
Skip the bump cuz the rump's what I came to view
New pussy in the hood, shall I kill it? (Kill It!)
The way she got it poppin, no, it's probably hotter than a skillet
But baby don't tweak, like you ain't no freak, peep
I keep my game tight, it ain't no leaks
So we can keep this on the down low
And take a walk with the Dogg and lemme show you what the pound for
Candlelight and romancin'
If I can just get the last dance in at the mansion
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better
No one throws a Eastside party like we do
Nobody...No one does it better
Snoop Dogg
They wonder how I do it, that's that big boy shit
State Seattles mean, that's them big boy kicks
The way I mack at a bitch, that's the big boy spit
Been around the world, did my time in the pen
Niggas in gangbangs is back on them swings
So how could you ever disrespect my place?
Since '93 strong I was all in your face
Big shows in arenas, bitches picker than Trina
Party like rock stars at the bars where I seen her
Made my move closely, you owe me
I brought the west back, what did you do?
Ain't nobody better than me
True hood rock star in me
Ain't nobody better than me
S-S-N-double O-E
Slow motion in the fast lane
Sitting at the top of the game where you ain't
Show after show, bank row in the Rolls
Living nice, big slice, got me slamming cans a doors
Three piece suit with a pocket watch
Snoop comin on[?], you all riding chrome like you gotta stop soon
Peer pressure to me, way to stop, bang in the seat way
I was the hog in the streets
Got in the game and broke the law on these beats
The slow flow killed and people said I rapped like I was chilling
Way above the stars, Snoop Dogg is top feeling
Plastics and all it was was keeping it true
I brought the west back, what did you do?
Who get it like I done it? (Nobody)
You just in it, nigga, I run it
Like I can't get in your grill 'cause I live in the hills
Snoopie this, Snoopie that, yeah, I heard what you said
Young ass buster, let me see your ID
I just chunked up a bill passing VIP
I gave niggas a lane to represent that G-A-N-G-S-T-A on me
Been crippin', been pimpin', been doing the do
Shot down to the shoes, man I brunk on shoes
Cotis at the mall, I've been keeping it truth
I brought the west back, what the fuck did you do, nigga?
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
But it ain't no thang, cause see my nigga Coolio
You know some of you niggas is so deceptive
Using my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt
Seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, patty-whack
I still got the biggest sack!
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
Why? hit em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
It make me wanna holler, cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for break off so take off your clothes
Speaking of hoes, I kick in the doors
Put my nuts on ya chin and the story goes
Why do bitch-ass niggas always talk shit
I knew he was a hoe
I've split, gums
You didn't know dumb-da-ditty-dumb
And my shit do harm so run, ring the alarm
I thought you knew I'm looney like Tony Montana
In the mix running shit, oops and um...
The smoothest, coolest, ruthless ya know
On a kamikaze mission (ooh, if I can be like Snoop)
Keep wishing, listen
With my balls in ya jaws, make room to put my dick in

Pretty sexy yet exotic fill em all in my Ferrari yep

Got 'em running upstairs got 'em coming in pairs
May I relieve you of your jacket can I touch you there
She took off her underwear, it ain't no hair under there
I solemnly swear, I will not share
This game with a lame, let him learn for himself

Man Kurupt so what's up, know you fucking
So I tell the bitch like this, you are nothing but shit
Cuz' everywhere I go, I gotta flow em' let em' know about the
Row so here we go, so know you punk niggas know
Ay yo Whoop there it is, nah Snoop there it is
Kurupt and Snoop Dogg just like they be kids
Getting crazy ripping and flipping and dipping cripping yo
And that's how we flow, it's still Death Row
And Snoop Doggy Dogg and I'm so [?]
From coast to coast and I'm like locust
I focus on the dopeness and don't be smoking [?]
This is Snoop Doggy Dogg, now would you focus
I'm so rough and rad I go get [?] everywhere I go I see I gotta
Do to you what I do to other motherfuckers from other cliques
Try to step to me so nigga load a clip
I see these motherfuckers from this other set
It's time to kill cuz' a nigga like me, like Shaquile I gotta slam their ass
I equip my strap and bust a gat lay em' flat like that, they shouldn't act like they wanna run up, now they done up
They get smoked nigga this the west coast
I break niggas, shake niggas take niggas to their whole
It's like 9-4 when I'm on parole
I don't really give a fuck about the shit they talk
Kurupt come here again
Hey, another day for me to get raw
Me? I kick back with Snoopy Doggy Dogg
Every hoe I see, recognize how they going
But yet Snoopy's niggas acting like they don't know my name
Oh, oh
I don't give a fuck because I'm just a nigga
I figure bigger niggas gotta reason to a trigger
Now I was strolling through the park one day
By [N-O-K?] puffing on a fat J'
Me and my DJ sat pussy
On five or six bitches they rolling in a -64 hitting switches
They say Snoop Doggy Dogg is that you?
I say hell fucking yeah, you know I'm sporting through in grey
I spit my game at this hoe her name is 'Faye Dunaway'
She staying around a corner, hey
Cuz' I really give a shit
I say, yo we got a party we gonna light this up
It's in my living room and we got the Ozone
So all we wanna see is assholes and tits
Jiggling and shaking, breaking taking off your clothes cuz'
We don't love them hoes
You got everything you want
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women weren't mine
So you stuck by my side
Everything you want and need
Cause everything you want and need
I'll be, I'll be
For eternity
I give you my love everyday
I'ma be yours either way
You and your niece, me and Jacquees
We can make love in between them sheets
All you can eat on me, it's a feast
So sweet, so rough, so tough, so bad
Get whatchu want, throw it in the bag
Stayed down wit' me even when I did wrong
That's probably why I'm singin' this song
Put your face on my right arm, tattoo
Met you, gotchu, get you
You're my angel, god bless you
Who am I in love with? Just you
Smokin' and strokin', just us two
This is splendid, flex it and bend it
Lay it out for ya
Now let me play it out for ya
You get what she won't 'cause she don't compare
You get what you want 'cause you have been there for me
Carefully, prepared to lay down your life for me
My life would be nothin' wit' outchu
And I ain't doin' nothin' wit' outchu
You got everything you want
You got everything you need
Yes I remember the times
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women weren't mine
So you stuck by my side
So everything
Everything you want and need
I'll comfort you, give you all of me
'Cause everything you want and need
It'll be you and me (that's all it will be)
For eternity (yeah)
I'ma be yours either way (either way)
He was gettin' money outta town (O.T.)
But it happened at the right time (it worked out)
And I know you got drip, fast whips and the mansions
Like when you cash out, know I can too
Yeah I run through the money, I ain't ran through
And I keep it a hunnid
Good head, down bitch, let him get in my stomach (uh-huh)
First lady, still married to money
Damn, I was on deep, he was still playin'
We was both young till I turned him into a man
Bitches do it for the 'Gram but this really who I am
If you get up in a jam, I'ma come through with the bands
I love you like that woman that carried you
Back and forth, no merry-go, die for you like burials
Yeah, I'm goin' to war if it's 'bout you (all day)
It ain't for me then it's not true (no it ain't)
I wanna be the last one you gotta lie to
I got everything I need if I gotchu
You got everything you want
You got everything you need
Yes I remember the times
When you caught me in lies
You knew other women weren't mine
So you stuck by my side
Everything you want and need (everything)
I'll comfort you, give you all of me (all of me)
Cause everything you want and need
I'll be, I'll be
For eternity
I give you my love everyday
Is this thing on?
Yeah
Nope
Now I just came out the club and now I’m breaking the bud
I’m shaking taking a chance with the Executive Branch
Now I’m making them dance
Keep a blunt in my hand and two packs in my pants
You know the greener the bud, and the strength of the leaf
I’m the Indian chief
They call me Bossaniva, Evel Knieva, Sativa Breatha
Imperial
And brought to you live in stereo
One come test me now
I’m movin' while I’m groovin', floatin' on a sound cloud
Girls wanna kiss us, boo, we got our own
It's the big boss Dogg on my ratchet flow
It's the original fantastico
Acid flow
With the white great interior
Tastes so good
The gentlemen’s choice for sure
The right great cigarillo
Pillow
In the middle
Never grito
I recite my hood rhymes
Smoke one this' for the good times
So let the girls on the flo'
They just left the Bellagio
They heard we' in the honeycomb
Now they want the Mardi Gras
It’s a party y’all, everybody in here
Done that, did that, been here
Hell yeah, fired up
We ain’t fucking with no powder puff
No Backwoods, Phillies or any other
The one and only, from the homie
SN double O
One for the money
Two for the show
Three to get ready
Now let’s blow
Executive Branch, branch, branch, branch, branch
Executive Branch, branch, branch, branch, branch
Let’s blow (blow blow)
For the good times
Brought to you by
Big Snoop DO double G
And the makers of Executive Branch
The gentlemen’s choice
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground
Sippin’ yac while I elevate my mind state
Hand by the burner in case a nigga try to violate
Never going down, stay rising like Andre
Cause my corner back every thing the don say
Long Beach, yeah I yell it out in every song
Err’y day, err’y night till I’m carried home
Forever known, big ballin’, try it in the city
Then yelling out swish way before it in the net
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There's only winners and losers, ain't no in between
You either hit the hall of fame or you fall to shame
And you ain't got to wonder where my place at
Pepsi blue rags sorta poppin, bitch taste that
One hit of the bong will blow ya face back
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP
Feeling like my life froze
I’m about to hit the ground
Live it like I’m talkin’
Flow so straight but won't a nigga try and walk in it
I’m so high, yeah the weed, I’m still sparking it
My bitch bad and my diamonds still sparkling
Got the competition shaking like parkinsons
Bread's in the bag, call it good marketing
Life’s a bitch but I don’t cartigan
Thats what a word to the third letter
Shots, shots, shots to me and my cheddar
Run these emcee’s I’m tougher than leather
Cause I don came from a long path
Only God knows how long the Dogg has
Cause like time we all pass
I’m about to hit the ground
I sold my soul to the devil that's a crappy deal
This game you could never win
Cause they love you then they hate you then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me fake bitches, I can’t take the phoniness
Get away from me wack tracks
I can only make only hits
I’m an only child lost in the World
Where did the lonely kids, go when the bell rings
It's feeling like hell rings
Bringing me back down
He's checking my background
Its ironic whats happening
Imagine if I didn’t have the ends
I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out dog, I be on that Moon talk
Wonder if God ask Mike how to moon walk
I swear to momma wish me and my father talk more
And we ain’t finna change, so we won’t agree again
Till then I’ll be pouring out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed
See it with my eyes closed

Hangin' on the dope spot slangin' they keys
Four lil, five lil, six lil cops
Not, knowin' I'm scopin' on the roof
I got my red beam, better have ya bulletproof
Cause the light don't miss once I put it to ya dome
They got my homies jacked, now they reachin' for they chrome
Al Capone was a hero of mine
Where they at? where they at? oh, they in the back
So I gotsta take my time and make sure that my nine
Get him, got him, spot him, shoot him, he's shot
And now they call me Snoop Gotti
I'm like a fugitive, Harrison Ford
Slidin' in the Chevy now the shit's gettin' heavy
But you know I can't choke so I call my nigga Loc
Gotta find the hideaway and a big bag of smoke
Cause if ya slippin', ya fallin' asleep on Death Row
And the judge just sentenced me to do about a century
I'm mobbin' through the county main line
Back in 9500, just tryna handle mines
As we try to pass time, waitin' for the chains
When a nigga's still alive, right?
Five o'clock wake up, call roll, call Doggy Dogg
Be at the chow hall from there I roam the yard
Still representin' to the fullest, so you know what time it is
I shank a nigga in a minute, abiding rules of the pen
Hittin' pushups by the g's to get bigger
Eight months, I'm on swole, my mind's clearer
Everyday of my life I take a glimpse in the mirror
And guess what the fuck I'm startin' to see
I still regulate sleepin' in the penitentiary
You brainwashed not to know you grew up wanting to be a pimp, you wanted to be a player (Right) You know, you grew up wanting to be these different things that are role models to you in your neighborhood, until you figure out that...hold on...I'm finna be the first role model that ain't that (Right)
Well I had a chance to listen to the album, it's very chill, it definitely makes you wanna smoke some weed
(Oh it do?)
Yeah, and I don't even really smoke
(You wanna hit some right now?)
I don't know if we're allowed to do that in here
(We need curtains, we need curtains in here)
No, Snoop can do what he wanna do
(I don't think so...)
Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness
And there ain't no doubt about it
All the songs that I did, and givin' back to the kids
I mean I done been everywhere that you wanna go
And poppin' on a stick like a pogo
My logo, is similar to the bat sign
Way up in the sky, When you wanna get high
Now look up, Now look up, I shook up the game
With the versatility, verbability, toungetwistagility
Hell yeah, they love the dog
Grandmomma's worldwide wanna hug the dog
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
Look I'm back at it, melodramatic
A little more dope for you Snoop Dogg addicts
Addicted to the things I do, magic
Go go go but no gadget, I'm magic
If I wasn't invented
Then you probably wouldn't even know how to represent it
For really though, I get that real hood love everywhere I go
From mommas, babies, grannies
You gotta love him even if you can't stand him
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
The way I feel about Snoop
You're back now at the jack-off hour
This is DJ EZ Dicc
On W-Balls
Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies from all the guys
A big bow wow wow
Cause we gonna make it a little misty here tonight
On the station that slaps you across your fat ass
With a fat dick
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
And I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking indo to smoke
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do?
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em
Woo! Hey, now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back up, bitch, because I'm struggling
Just get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Slide off that you're feeling right
I know what you need, girl
Smoke you some weed, girl
Sit back, let me take your time!
I impress the ladies, ain't no questions, baby
I got the answer for you and me
Make you feel like Heaven!
Put your make-up and your Gucci on
Rock star like, baby, camera, lights, movie's on!
Plus, I feel the vibe of what you want
You be doing that that cool thing
All the grown, new thing
I got you coming back, turn around, boomerang
Underground doing things
Girl, I know you like that
Don't get tough, sweet like a
Nigga like a track store, afraid to run
Try to catch a milly on! (Slow it down!)
Baby, let me catch up with you
Get that cake up, leg it down, wake up with you
Stand down, and taste the picture
I got a cool lil' skirt because I'm damn that mister!
I keep my plan on focus, my focus is you
We're cool as a one bo, we're cool as a two
I'm sitting in my whip outside, now step out and just
Welcome to the majors with Soopafly, look alive!
We back at the house, swimming pool, sip or die
Take it off, slide on me!
Work it like a Romeo, glide on it, make it cream
Double stuffed Oreo
I'm like the Mario, I got my chest out
Macking while I sit back, you can pull the rest out
Pray to get your next out, slide to the left and
Now I'm looking at your best friend
She bad!! I look at the mess we're in
And I don't play no games, though
Plus, that ain't what I came for
(No) I wanna slide out, smoke with you
Rub on your angle
Then give me head like a bankroll
I got a cool disposition, girl
I like you right in this position, girl
I'm the boss, get submissive, girl
So you can just

Head on swivel 'cause anything can happen
I was banging before I was rapping (Rapping)
I was slanging before it was trapping (Trapping)

After life threw me all them curveballs (Curveballs)
You'da thought I gave up, but nah (Nah)
Grow man, thug it out, stand tall
I hustled every day, how you think I got it all?

Baby, can you focus on me?
Focus on me
So much smoke in the air, you can't see shit
Servin' Crip dick 'til the bitch sea sick
West to East shit for all my dawgs and my Heathcliffs
Streets on tax so the heat's on my lap
When it's war, fuck the law, fuck it, bury me strapped
Money long as 21 Cadillacs
Matter fact, get it scratched like BattleCat
Only nigga with a star that got put on at the Park, nigga
That's on the set, that's on my mama
I could still pull up at the Park, nigga
Focus on me
On God, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
Every word I rapped, nigga, I lived that
Focus on me
Give it up, I did that, I did that
Gangbangers rejoice when they hear my voice
Pullin' up in Rolls Royce, the hood in full-force still
Realizing I'm the source still
The wrong move could get my boys killed
So I focus on me
Makin' sure this whole shit stay rollin'
And my baby boo neck stay frozen
Rich rollin', on the clock, non-stop
And my bank account sure shows it
So don't worry 'bout mine, nigga, we good
And fuck what y'all think, "Free Suge"
Diamond in the back with the leather with the wood in it
Banged around the world, made sure I kept the hood in it
Yeah, one time for the king
And I still smoke a nigga like a big bag of weed
On moms
Focus on me
On God, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
Every word I rapped, nigga, I lived that
Focus on me
Give it up, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?
Baby, can you focus on me?

Peep the murderous styles and the poetical techniques
So all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your motherfuckin fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
Keep your motherfuckin fingers in the air
Take down, when it comes to the mic I'm puttin my weight down
And that's 175 pounds of beef
Beatin' yo' ass down to the concrete
Fool, act like ya know
I'm stranded on Death Row with no where to go, so
What's a girl to do
Take out a crew, or two, a few, what you wanna do?
So all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin hands in the air
Artist: Snoop Doggy Dogg
Song:   Freaky Tales
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked on the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I shook her hand
We ended up freakin by a garbage can
The next young freak, I met was Red
I took her to my house and she gave me head
She like blowin dicks, is all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Sherry
You talk about sex and the girl acts scary
I heard she was freakin from my big brother Jerry
Took her to my crib and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
She'll only start talkin bout signin a lease
I met a young tender, her name is Lori
An X-Rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
My girlfriend's name, was Michelle
Her booty was bigger than the tail on a whale
When I freaked Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than the flames of Hell
I didn't wanna do it cause the bitch was ?flantly?
I pulled her to the side and I spit that game
I had a lot of freaks, in my lifespan
I freaked one night, with this girl named Pam
The very next day, I saw her with her man
I had an old tender, her name's Jeanine
She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I want a big freak, fat and sloppy
I kick on back, and watch the ho just mop me
A country broad from Alabama
I met this freak, her name was Beth
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as Hell, I was drippin sweat
But I was all up in her tryin to hold my breath
Bake, and, shake, ups
I met this freak in Vegas
She she said her name was Don-na
She was a ?belt? lil' freak from Chi-na
I'm havin so much paper I don't need a ho
You can break yourself, but you can't break me
You never met a player like Snoop baby"
I knew a dick sucker named Betty Joe
I took her to my house and we did it on the flo'
The girl got freaky let me tell you mo'
She's like another freak, named Renee
You get her all alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
And with a freak like Renee you can Have It Your Way
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, the freaky tales
Yea man, I heard you wasn't gonna do it no more
Overwith? shit nigga I ain't going nowhere
Shit nigga I ain't going nowhere
Snoop Dogg this is me
Back up in the place to be
I walk a bit, I blaze a jay
I'm going at baby
Listen close we gon' dream
When things was bad this that time
When I'm gon' smash getting cash
Is all I know, I think the year was '94
Or was it later really don't matter
Cause I gets cheese , I gets cheddar
Funny style, funny niggas
Funny style, funny niggas
They funny style, aye Snoop
Punk motherfuckers in disguise I can tell
Soon as I see them when I rise in the spot
Gotti in the building everybody realized
Looking in my eyes niggas is surprised
What the fuck is cracking don't they know what's happening?
The next time this nigga get close, clap him
This nigga like a bitch moving so slow
Just bring the beat back and let the shit bang
Cause Snoop is on the mic and I came to bang
I don't come to play I come to drop heat
And niggas like you get dusted in the streets
You just try to rap about what you know
And I'm gonna keep this shit way on the low
Me man my clique me and my crew
We come through this bitch and banging on you
You think you can fuck with us
But I don't think you'll fuck with us
For 20 years and thats all me
Bitch, run through the spot
Tipping the hit
Run and get all my money nigga I get
The bitches they love me and they stay on my dick
I'm rolling with dabs, little half [?]
Me and big Snoop getting that bread
Make them pussy lips spread
Loving my Mercedes what up bitch
And let me get these niggas close to me
You can size me up, you can picture the frame
You can change up the beat and you can slow this shit down
You can try to get close but this is still Dogg Pound
We be fuckin it up, we be smoking the dope
We be on the tour bus from coast to coast
Every corner, all my hoes
All my homies, all my souls
In a second niggas get hit then it's over
Look look, why these niggas trippin all over
In the spot with my homies deep with heaters
So y'all should know when you stepped up
You got fucked up and that's what's up
DPGC I thought you knew
Ay Dogg, let me holla at'cha man
Wuz up home?
Since Dre did shake the spea's out, man
Delicate? Beats?
So that's what makes me now?
Man, I don't give a fuck about no beat
(I hear ya Dogg)
(It's a cold, cold thing!)
(It's a cold thing!)
I got more niggas tryin to get at me than the President do sometimes
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin' way too funny
Doin too much, y'know I see it from the get-go
What the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know
I ain't givin no room to try to get me first
Fifth in the world, but I'mma keep my thang together
Cos I'mma keep makin money and hope everything is still together
Havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?
All y'all broke on the corner
Drinkin your drink, wanna be doin what I'm doin
But don't get mad and don't be tryin to play-hate
Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state
Representin, uhh, what y'all wanna represent
But y'all can't represent it cos y'all got no dollars, no cents
I'm movin on, groovin on and I'm movin
Makin more moves than the average Cuban
Tryin ta get G's across the town, tryin ta make more hits
And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch
Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'
Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump in, bring a friend
Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back
Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac
It's on me, I'm feelin good tonight
Cos I'mma do mines and I'mma keep everything tight
I ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I'm get caught
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight
But I ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way Dogg
I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight
I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat, ain't that right
You can't be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man
Cos if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you
And I can put that on everything including you
One of every five black males before the year 2000
No justice, no peace
Yeah the truth hurts, if you're scared, go to church
Look here, but don't cut it, gettin five points
Step back for a second, I'm puttin less than five to this joint
Hmm, if this is the bomb niggas gonna blow up like Atlanta at the Olympics
Niggas be trippin but I'll be pimpin
Just tryin to get money, I don't even be trippin off no switches
I put it down wit me and make a hit maker, y'knowhatI'msayin?
I love the Lakers now cos now they got Shaq O'Neal
It's time to make a million dollars and that's for real
See we gone blow up and show up and throw up nuttin but Dogg Pound
Guaranteed to put it down and we'll be 'round to your town
Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do
Cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do
Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions
Cos the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep
Tryin ta get up on game but they don't wanna be down with the PG
All of a sudden everybody wanna dis DP
Now, what we look like?
Makin y'all diss us, that ain't right
I should get upset but I'mma stay composed
Chill for a second, spit at some hoes
Stanky bank is what I got cos I'mma keep it
And nah this ain't no motherfuckin secret
Yeah, we're in drought season
Niggas lookin for a reason
Yeah the truth hurts, we're scared to go to church
They got me runnin' for my life, I'm jumpin' gates
Like nigga back up off me
He turn around and bite the police, hmm
Game recognise Snoop Dogg too cold, I'm on my toes
I slide in the back of a garage, dippin with this ho
They run right past me, ask me "Have I seen the suspect?"
"Yeah, he went that way", now for the jack
It's like this, yeah, and it don't stop
Now stand up on ya feet and peep the beats
Snoop Doggy Dogg's on the mic I'd like to speak, preach
To each and all, I don't stall
Y'all know who the dopest rapper is his name is Doggy Dogg
I freak and speak and preach to you
Cos' I'm on the microphone sportin' grey and blue
I'm the smooth macadamia. Snoop Doggy Dogg, I
Make you jump, pump, pump, grab your gat but you might find yourself slump, hump
You can't see me, you wanna' be me
I got a message to the CPT- Wassup' Eazy?
You can't see the Dogg 'cos I'm out to chin check
They call me the super-duper, superb
Hit 'em up, Get 'em up, Spit 'em up, word
{ Verse 1: Nate Dogg}
When I met you last night baby. Before you opened up your gap. I had respect for you lady, but now I take it all back. Cause you gave me all your pussy, and you even licked my balls. Leave your number on the cabinet, and I promise baby I'll give you a call. Next time I'm feeling kind of horny. You can come on over, and I'll break you off. And if you can't Fuck that say baby, just lay back and open your mouth. Cause I have never met a girl. That I love in the whole wide world
{ Verse 2: Kurupt}

{ Verse 3: Snoop Dogg}

See Kurupt don't give a Fuck, Snoop don't give a Fuck so guess I'll just say that I don't give a Fuck.

But back up bitch because I'm struggling, just get on your knees and then start juggling. These MuthaFuckin nuts in your mouth. It's me Warren G the nigga with the clout

Starship watch a nigga in the backseat gold mat
Let 'er with the fix, turn around, where the dough at?
I told you in was hungry, don't be fuckin' with me
I slice you up like pie then eat you like heap
Drive a light Ferrari and it's me in the streets
Tryna get rich, I'm on one, it's me and my heat
But you ain't shit if you ain't shit without your home boys
40 niggas tap in lack, we all strapped
Blokes on the face, La on the ball caps dog
Dog food in the dick, cat piss in the ashtray
Hit the switch on that lack, let that ass spray
Lukes shootin' dimes that flask in the ashtray
Ski mask up, hit 'er with yo ass up

I'm ridin' shotgun in the fleet with Brome
Motherfucker pop a nigga from cut and ass

Fill them clips to the max and let me get up in my mol
That's they gave my nigga Corey life, another row
My nigga can't speak so the story's never told
I'm a break it down to you episode by episode
See my uncle in the kitchen puttin' pots on the stove
The right pimps get drugs in lil rows
I was only 'bout 10 or 11 years old
I had to get in it fast, it was money in the note
It didn't take long for I really was a spokes
See the reason stand with a handful of hoes
I've paid price on, goes deeper than you know
He said it was a setup, let it on some price chance
I'm a ballin' 2 fucks, you motherfuckers dead
For all the really niggas in the Cadillacs
Better get down, get your head blown
We don't give a fuck, livin' in a warzone
Pistol packin' and we blowin' on this ozone
Motherfucker pop a nigga from cut and ass
For lil niggas in the Cadillac
Yea motherfuckin' nigga, it's on
Yea motherfuckin' nigga, it's on
Yea motherfuckin' nigga, it's on
Yea motherfuckin' nigga, it's on
It's time to slow it down, steadily grindin
And this is, the big Doggy Dogg..
And I ain't talkin about no Air Force Ones
I just gotta know, before you let me get some
Silk cotton see-through lace your sexy thong
I got to know, or you could show, me
Let a nigga sneak a few, peek-a-boo
Let's see what we can do
I'm bout freakin you, and sneakin you
Into a quiet place
So I can look at it face to face
I can tell, cause you like squattin
Your last dude, he was so rotten
And now your love is to be gotten
But what I'm really tryin to do is read between your pantylines
I know it seems oh so personal
But I'm just tryin to make you feel real comfortable
And the type of underwear you wear I mean it's troublin me
Can I get a glimpse, one for the pimps?
I got one question, answer me this then
You came by the church with a whole lot of body
Workin that lace, I think it was the French cut
Yeah bitch, you got a big ol' butt
It's real tight now but I got a way to widen it
With a little bit of Miles Davis to get you in the mood like
Zoom boom hit the poom-poom right
Just to get your groove right
I can make it happen, but it can't happen if you ain't good at it
But it's on you if you wanna go real far
Now let me get a glimpse, one for the pimps
I, have one question, answer me this
Than you'll think
It's so hard
Hard to trust a smile and face
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place
Will you pick me up at all?
Will you pick me up at all?
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end
Cause some people do pretend
And ain't too many of us that we can call friends
Ohhhhhhh
Now all I gotta do is keep my head up
And walk a straight line when fake friends won't mind
But I'm kind-hearted
And don't like being stepped on
If I wasn't real, I wouldn't be in this position
Like that, dogg, I got a whole lot to say
I'm by myself with my rhymes when we kick it all day
Lil' Jay used to say I'd never be nobody
But you know what I never do?
Smoke it off like Gotti
Five million dollar hits puttin in saxophones
Tray Deee & Snoop, we sound good on this microphone
I never threaten nobody to make it happen
Let me show you how we eat a full meal off this rappin'
But if I had a chance to give it back
I'd give it to the ones who helped me do that
Do that, straight from the heart
Eastside till I die
It's a trip how we Crip
Suppose the enemies still
With both sides ride causing plenty of tears
Insane's and 20's both from the same city
A bunch of down niggas and it ain't that many
Me, C, and the G can think back to the start
Homies chillin', getting high, shooting craps in the park
And having a heart
To get 'em up if it was beef
Head up like G's, take it out in the street
So I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few
And homie that ain't nothing that the set could erase
You put me with the homie, Goldie, though we never had spoke
And y'all kids, my kids, so we family now
Cause I could never see you doing bad without
And that's real
Like a game'll make yo chips sink
Hard to trust a smile and face
When niggas got intentions already taking yo place
Keep my head up and stand tall
If I stumble, then I'll fall
I'm a keep it gangsta till my end
Cause some people do pretend
That we can call friends...
And don't stop till you get enough
I wanna rock with you
Shake your stuff (2x)
Yo Yo, Doctor
Everybody hit the floor
Wild out till the security hit the door
I'm dirty
Gorilla paws, bang sugar walls
Hoes wanna pop E, hang with a Dogg
Got a ho with no dough with condoms with her
Look at it crook at it
Rob you and jet
Funk in the Cadillac truck with a chicken, bobbing her neck
You done called up Hugh Heffer to find the freaks
I'mma stay on the street
I'mma stay saying 'fuck you' behind police
My mamma ain't raise no fool, she love me
I'm a jump, bump, throw that ass
Rough sex, I gotta fuck with shoulder pads
Ain't nann ho getting Redman butter
And my man Gutter, DJ Murder Inc
Underground the heat yeah I stay buzzing
Meth, show'em where the luger kept
Open your safe, show me where the food and vest
I hope when Dre hear this, he give a beat for ten more
Cause I stay on the corner like squegeemen
Yo Nate Dogg, what's happening y'all
Long Beach, Brick City
Scream at your frog
Everybody shaking
All these hoes around me
She was lost in the land of love
Glad that Nate Dogg found me
Girl you got a phatty
New York back to Cali
Long Beach to Brick City
I know just want you want, I got just want you need
Turn that shit around, and back it up on me
Since I was the first, I guess I'll be the last to leave
D-O-double-G, will you keep it gangsta please
I gots to do it
Yes Yes loc', we keep the best smoke
Me and my nigga, my nerve, my kinfolk
I kick a bitch in the ass and then smoke
I'm a motherfucking fool in the pool doing the breaststroke
Cause if not I came to disco
And freak this ho from Acopoqo
And flip her inside out, now I'm bout to ride
Let's go we hit the hood slow
Post up, set up shop and press four
Who got the best flow, who got the most dough
Who got the best hoes, nigga you know
Shit its been ten years since I hit some cess smoke
But I still rock a mean coat on the West Coast
And I crumble mine down to the dandelion
Nigga watch how I handle mine
Spiritual, hear we go, hear this
Snoop D-O-double-G, man I'm so fearless
Square biz, you know what time it is
I'm cool on these niggas but I'm hard on a bitch
Now check dis, fact is
Put your back out, now back in
Go head wiggle it round you feeling me now
Girlfriend, you killing them now
The way you shake your booty
It makes me want your booty
The way you shake your booty
Fa shizzle dizzle, it's the big Neptizzle
With the Snoopy D-O-Double Gizzle!

I'm still loc'n on these beats and keep a bad bitch on the streets
Biggest dogg of 'em all, and youse a flea'n
And since I got time to drop it for you I guess I must
And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust
I keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust
And can't none of y'all fuck with us
But you can run up on the G but that's not thinkin' wisely
These thrillers are "Contagious", just like Ron Isley
What the hell is goin on? Someone's sleepin in my home
Snoop to the D-O-Double G (uh-huh)
Who's the man with that dance? (Snoop Dogg!)
Who keep the khakis for all his pants? (Snoop Dogg!)
Keep the low-low in a three-wheel stance (Snoop Dogg!)
I do it for the G's and I do it for the hustlers
Here to annihilate you mark-ass busters
Eff the police cause all they wanna do is cuff us
The world is fuckin' chilly as if his name was Usher
But I'm still ridin' them 'llacs, makin them G stacks
And got them cornrows to the back
I ain't really tryin to be picky
But if you give me somethin, it's got to be the sticky
Green by the ounces, low-lows bouncin
Sandy Fay and Annie Mae kissin on my couch and
Ooh to the ouch and, Moet fountain
That's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n
This year we ain't fuck with thousands
Pull up to the Doggy Dogg palace
With a car fulla bitches cookin grits like Alice (ooh!)

You knew that, we do that, like it's 'sposed to be done
It'd be fun if you didn't have a gun
But if you didn't had one you'd probably run; come come
Now spit it from the tip of your tongue, a lil wisdom
Gives em somethin' to move to, groove to
The next time you see me again gangsta'd up
Chilling wit my beanie again got many of friends
In b-ball, football, baseball, the penetentianary, the graveyard
The church house and the mess hall
With no flaws, yiggy yes yall touch y'all from up above
Show big love, kept the crippin' alive
As well as the dub, push come to shove
Y'all know how it all was
(Chorus)
But niggas still talk about me (talk about me)
Don't give a fuck about me
I made them read about me (read about me)
Niggas gon talk about you
Bitches gon love to doubt you

And made em write about it
Fuck what they say about me
(Snoop Dogg)

And put some soul in ya ass Like James Brown (owwww!)

{*funkafied version of "The People's Court" TV show in the background*}
Mac Minista in defense of the honorable Snoop Dogg
In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 counts
Of flexing his G's, popping his P's
Dotting his I's and crossing his T's
The anti-player has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
In the Game Court. With trumped up charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts
Of verbal and reckless endangerment
From the million dollar mouthpiece;
And leaving these super-sap suckers
Discombobulated and confused and shook up, like a pair of dice
The anti-player, has filed and submitted an "alpha"-davit
In the Game Court. Charging my client Snoop Dogg
Tha Doggfather - for distributing and manufacturing game
Crossing state and county lines, with the intent to pimp the system
Now if you wanna judge Tha Doggfather
Bring him before 12 G's and open up his files
And you will see, that ever since Snoopy was a pup
His tail was straight up - ready to shake rattle and roll
And charge from a ho to a henchman about his pension
So all you jerks with them $11 words
About a multi-million dollar Crip
Who's got the mind of a bid'ness man, the heart of a tyrant
And the tongue of a mack - I said
While you suckers is lookin for stripes
To grant a motion, of 995 - grounds, of dismissal
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
I had respect for you lady
But now I take it all back
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny
You can come on over
Just lay back and open your mouth
Cause I have never met a girl
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking endo to smoke
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in tha Pound
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nothing but a bitch to me
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Why don't y'all pay attention
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Guess who back in the motherfucking house
With a fat dick for your motherfucking mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cause when bitches get scandalous and pull a voodoo
What you gon' do?
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust that ho
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
But see it ain't no fun
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Cause you know I don't love em
Hey now you know
Three to get ready and four to hit the switches
In my Chevy, '64 -- red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So get on your knees and then start juggling
These motherfucking nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Gangsta
This is a service public announcement
Now sure sure sure your broke, sure sure sure your havin' problems
Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me "What's that?"
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg, would like to say
That I'mma crazy mothafucker when I'm playin' with my A.K
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
Smokin' you and your crew, takin' a life or two
This is my gang, nigga, No Limit
My nigga C will fuck you up in a minute
With the pow pow, bang bang (*gun shots*) and you're dead
And then we stamp that Tank on your forehead
Every where we go they say "DAMN"
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we to busy sayin' yeaaaahhhhhh
Do I look like a mothafuckin' role model?
To a kid lookin' up to me
Shit, life ain't nothin' but weed and money
Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck cause I keep sellin'
Yo, what the fuck are the yellin?
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches straight buyin' it, cause they love that straight G shit
Homies all standin' around just hangin'
Some dope dealin, some gang bangin' "what up nigga?"
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my double pointin' at his window
He got scared and hit the gas "Damn"
Right then, I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin, I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to Snukes
With seven niggas in a Navs, bitch you crazy?
She was scared and it was showin'
So we all said "FucK YOU Bitch" and kept rollin'
To the hood, now we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
Gettin' rowdy, shit but we call it rat pack
On a nigga follow nothin' at all
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fuckin' with my Tank dogs
I might stumble and still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blues
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See, I don't give a fuck cause I keep bailin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin?
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
Niggas livin' rowdy and stay bout it, bout it
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit
Hold.. hold on Craig, B cut that shit man
Mothafuck that man, we need some gangsta in this motherfucker
Some of that South shit, you know what I'm sayin?
Some of that shit from the thiz-ird source, you heard me?
Here's another gangsta down to ride
A T-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
He represents the Tank, yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit
Well, I'm C-Murder the one he talkin' about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me, you know they some haters
I said "See you later" jumped in the Navigator
With the $50's in the back, with the Navy blue top
Cause I'm the C fool, I slang and Snoop bang
And I'll smoke a mothafucker like it ain't no thing
To all my bitches, I know your jockin' my crew
"We want to fuck you C"
You see, No Limit niggas don't take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers who you fuckin' with
Cause I'm the kind of nigga that's quick to blast
If you fuck with me, I'mma smoke your ass
I don't give a fuck cause No Limit stay sellin'
Now tell me, what the fuck are they yellin?
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're yellin'
"Gangsta Gangsta" that's what they're sellin'
The bitches want to buy it, cause they love that straight G shit
If you would just stayed down and been the motherfuckers real partner
You wouldn't have had that problem
But seein, as you want to jump ship and you thought the ship would sink
A motherfucker without turnin' into a submarine
Now, you have no paper, and now you're on a paper caper
Now, you comin' up to my face and you're sayin: Hey can I hang out?
Now, I'm tired of all these silly ass mothafuckin' paper chasin' whores
Uhh, this has been a public service announcement from No Limit Records
And the Doggy Dogg world
Dogg back up in this motherfucker
Hoes know how to act up in this motherfucker
All blue Chuck's and my khakis in this motherfucker

Hmm, now that's my kinda bitch

Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
At the end of the night I'll take you home)
Got two friends, we can have group sex

My nasty video made her do porn
And she go real far
Still can't believe that she's talkin' to a real star
Pop told me real hard
And threw that backshot on me real hard
Royal penis is clean, I'm king like the boulevard
Dogg do his thing, got her feelin' like a superstar
Wanna share her feelin's with her friends
And she say that I made her fall in love
I had to shake her fast like I wasn't when I was
Got my game from the streets, never been for a freak
Had the nerve to ask for money when I beat it up
I looked at the bitch like cut, dat-dat-dat
I ain't ever met another gangsta like you
I ain't really sure but I think I'd like to
(Girl you will never meet a gangsta like me
We can our thing but you can't be wifey
Go and let your Doggy boy give you a bone
The homies say cuz don't do it to her
You gon' have to always do it to her
She be creepin' to your hotel, sayin' that she won't tell
Knowin' one night won't do for ya
(Nope) You know I got that gangsta
Make you wanna tell my mama "thank ya"
Then give me all your paper, everytime I lay ya
See a bad bitch, is like a fat blunt

Wanna chill, when you down for the smashin'?

That plan you got ain't gonna work you better audible
With persistence, I proceed
Supplying you with what you need, no room for greed

Bitches in heat we tear the beat up, what?
On the microphone I bury the bone
Uhh, to get the pooper scooper, why? They droppin' doo-doo
I'm steppin' on shit, lift up the bottom of my shoe
See I'm smashin' full-breaded wit no leash
When I mob, make marks across the street
See I'm vicious like hell, got 'em waggin they tail
For the bow-wow LBC style
On the receiver, go get it like a retriever
Wit the mizzic, see I let the Doggz loose on 'em
Check this out here man, I lick 'em, sick 'em
Man's best friend, I hit you for ten, uhh
Fleas can't seize my pack, what, what's my name?
Major trick we're hittin' licks like the Doberman Gang

Run a cat up a tree, nigga it's DPG
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
Snoop wit the .44 knockin at'cha door
We the passion for smashin and mashin the masses
Knockin' niggas like Cassius, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
Cos for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch
Free the D-O-double G with the solid gold bone
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all
Intro:
You're back now at the jack-off hour this is DJ, Eazy Dick
On W-Balls, right now, somethin new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one goes out to the ladies, from all the guys
A big bow wow wow, cuz we gonna make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, on the station that
Slaps you across your fat ass, with a fat dick
Verse One: Nate Dogg
But now I take it all back
Cause you gave me all your pussy
And ya even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise baby, I'll give ya a call
Next time I'm feelin kinda horny
You can come on over, and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lay back, and open your mouth
In the whole wide world
Verse Two: Kurupt
Well, if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I gets loced and looney, bitch you can't Do Me
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin I learned in the pound
So how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to lay this hoe
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it, there's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
Cause she ain't nuthin but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention
Chorus: (repeat 4X)
It ain't no fun, if the homies can't have none
Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg
Guess who back in the motherfuckin house
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
Cuz when bitches get skanless and pull a voodoo
So I'd advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowin damn well, I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
Cause you know I don't love em
Verse Four: Warren G
Whoa!
Hey, now ya know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
In my Chevy, six-fo' Rad to be exact
Off your knees and then start jugglin
These motherfuckin nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G the nigga with the clout
Whoo!
Now $hort! I know you didn't think that shit was over
Nothin' can save ya
Ain't no love, $hort (4x)
Now mickity mic down
Guns out, mothafuckas
Lowin' the holes
It's the kid from the gutter
Punks get on tapes
And they sound so real
But real niggas don't get in court and squeal
Yeah, regard all that punk ass Racia shit
Like a bitch, little snitch
He made me with it!
Court is in session, $hort
And you've been indicted
And you gets no love from the gutter
See we remember when you had to have
A baserock cawy and a nice hot bath
Smokin' and chokin', Sir Too $hort
Just thinkin' about the day before
See you never shouldn't fuck
With the real killa
I goes deep on you dopefiend nigga
Got on the mic and called me a punk
And funk is what you want
Dirty, tired, fucked around
And get my foot off in his ass
Let's hood ride, mob, fuck talkin' bad
No punk let?s me check myself, partner
I ain't gonna bust ya
I rather ride up and drop ya
But the rappin' is weak shit
And I'm down with this street shit
The ugliest nigga in rap
Try to cap on the nigga
From the mothafuckin' hood
So when I see you it's all good
Too $hort...
Nothin' can save ya
Ain't no love, $hort (4x)
I boarded to your ass last year
But you didn't hear me dough
It's 94 and Banks need a little more
Lips lookin' hell of luscious
Digidy down goes my zipper
Nigga, you can suck this
And you must like slurpin' dicks
Because you ridin' on $hort's tip
Like a jockin' little bitch
Ridin' around in your too-$hort-hand-me-down
I left the Dangerous Crew
And that's why you're clownin' now
The bigidy Banksta ain't no gigidy gigidy gangsta
When the truth comes out you ain't shit but a pranksta
Try to hang in my hood lookin' out of place
With that blank ass look on your face:
Now get in where you fit in, chunk
So I ain't givin' no rule
To assume you want some mothafuckin' funk
Then bring it to the crew
So bring it on if your ass want to trip
And to this hollow-tip, bitch
Blast that ass, yes I would
Cause on the streets, nigga, it's all good
Too $hort...
Nothin' can save ya
Ain't no love, $hort
Oh, there goes my pager
And it's your bitch, yo, I think I best to fade her
Little light skinned bitch got just a little too hot
It's goin' down, pannies comin' off
Another tramp bitch got automatically toasted
I think you found out and got jealous
Cause I was diggin' your bitch
But you took her home
And wanted to marry the bitch
I would dig her in this, mister
And bury the bitch
Stop spendin' all your cash and fix your teeth
$hort Dog must like bein' ugly
Came at a nigga wrong
Little cavity creep walkin' around with Nikes on
Cause I did funk with the best
So when you ridin' in your lexus
Nigga, put on the vest
And stay the fuck out my hood
Cause death is a factor and it's all good
Nothin' can save ya
Ain't no love, $hort (4x)

Late night, hangin' on the corner (Gangsta, Gangsta, Gangsta)
East Long Beach, California
Daytonas when I run up on ya
Real dog, bitch, tryna catch a boner
I get what I get, I'm a goner
And smoke more dope than a stoner
I sip what I sip when I sip
Don't flip when I trip on a bitch, 'cause I'm on one
Haul ass for the cash...
Snoop Dogg came back for your ass
Grass and trees, ass up, bitch, on your knees
Do what I please
Take her, make her get more
Even if she never sold her pussy hole before
It's a slow process
Rub my fingers up your dress
Hold these nuts, it's a test
Hide this package in your breasts
Don't say no, always say yes
You are my, my best
Oh yeah, what it do?
That's why I wrote this song for you
All my bitches, all my hoes
Fly ones, tight ones, and even the white ones
All my bitches, all my hoes
All my bitches, all my hoes
Don't say shit, bitch, keep it on the low
For the Dogg, protocol, you know
I won't get caught, I refuse
A nigga just chose, so I choose you
Really not tryna confuse you, or abuse you, or misuse you
It's back to the bed frame
Real P.I., all in your head game
I got the bitch that's got the most ass
She's a lawyer with a visa
And that's what it do
That's why I wrote this song for you
Heavenly Father, I wanna thank you for what you've done for me
In my life, I try so hard to be faithful, and I am faithful to you
And my soul just running away to you, and I want you to grab my hand and hold me
I know, I know, I know
One of these days, I'm gonna run away to you
Yes I am
Make me wanna run away
On my knees at night, I pray
You always got something to say
In the kitchen with my kinfolk, cookin'
They say the devil always show up when you're not lookin'
That's why I'm doing God's work
I'll hook 'em with the scripture
Then bring it all to life so everyone can get the picture
See, this is for my folks who hold the fence up
The preachers, ministers, deacons, ushers and the sisters (What?)
My granny used to say "Give us our daily bread"
She put it in my heart, and now it's in my head
Make me wanna run away
That we will live another day
I'm at the park, playin' ball with the children
Providing the league so I can help restore the feeling
It's a blessing to give back, so let's keep giving it
Walk by faith, and showing how we livin' it (Livin')
Lovin' it, avoiding the hate
Shout out to Ruth for giving birth to Nate
That's my homeboy's momma
We take God with us
Do right, don't fight
Or try to squab with us
And that's fact, truth mane
The Gospel
Sittin' on the corner, tryna figure the fall
You done got too high, now you're feeling so low
I'm just a nobody, tryna tell everybody
About somebody who can save anybody
Make me wanna run away
On my knees at night, I pray
That we will live another day
Ya,uh
I was once told
You get your freedom
By letting your enemy know that
Youll do anything to get your freedom
Then youll get it
When you get that kind of attitude
Or they just call you a crazy nicca
They dont say negro
Or theyll call you an extremist
Or a subversive
Or a setatus
Or a red or radical
But when you stay radical long enough
And get enough people to like you
Youll get your freedom
So dont rum around here
Tryin to make friends
With somebody whos deprivin'
You of your rights
Their not your friends
And treat them like that
And fight them
And youll get your freedom
And after you get your freedom
Cuz i dont have no hate in me
If you want to know what ill do
Figure out what youll do
And ill do the same
(damn... shit)

Feel the blaze
Who's the number one (there's nothing new under the sun)
Feel the awake
You're awake
You're awake
It definitely starts glowing
Get up close, you'll feel so much better
With the G  come to the light
Damn a nigga only got 20 dollars shit
Check this out
Nigga 20 dollars to my name
Deep in this dice game
I fucked off two g's
Nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my Glock
Why? so I can rob every known dope spot
I'm having hard times, grit, and grind
Shit I'm trying to get mine
Ain't nothing to lose plus I'm living on the frontline
It's a cold twist the way that shit goes
Gotta keep your hands on some motherfuckin' fetty yo
And keep a down bitch for when your money run out
And shoot'em up 'til they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga chipped in
I'm amongst killers with a dub in my pocket loc
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a nigga Snoop Dogg have 20 dollars to my name
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed
I got 19 dollars and 50 cents up in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
Gotta have it to pop it, unlock it, and take me up a hostage
Let'em now this itch of my finger is worser than jock itch
Erasing cops tips and sisters that pop lip, stop this
Soda couldn't rock this
My [?] can't chop this
See this here with a hole
Allowed that silencer to blow
Now with this last 20 dollars I might buy me some douja
I seen my nigga nigga from way way back
Me and him used to jack and rock a rental Cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossin
He sees my wrist, he says damn nigga you flossin
And I'm bossin, and tossin' 'em up at the same time
So if you thinking about with me it'll be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger over 20 dollars, that's all I got
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it ain't worth being
Shot
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
Because we can't slang the urb
Cause we smoke too much weed
Now 20 dollars to my name in this game of drugs
And the only thing we now is gan bangers and thugs
If my yale don't sell how shall we proceed
Because we can't slang the urb
Now look, I'm fresh up out of jail it feels good to be on the outside
I had 120 dollars, but I spent a 100 on my ride
Now the only thing I got left is 20 dollars to my name
Nigga want front me some motherfuckin' caine
Nigga now now I gotta be on some murder one shit
Some slum shit Some out the projects dumb shit
Some weed and blunt shit Some I don't give a fuck shit
Where it from shit Some penitentiary solitary
Confinement never see no motherfuckin' sun shit
Door Now whether it's rapping, or jacking, kidnapping, or gun totting
It be a hustle just to eat And it be hard on these streets
Gotta get my hustle
On Got 20 dollars y'all now that shit don't last long picture this
(Snoop Dogg inhaling)
It's the big boss dog, Snoop D-oh-double-G

But I never forget about what I love the most, and that's makin' music
So uhh, I hope y'all enjoy this shit right here
Oh yeah! Be on the lookout for QDT
Oh, my nigga Terrance Martin in this motherfucker too
Ay, press play homey!
Right now-now-now-ow-ow-ow
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
Standin' amazing, hit you in the brain
Put you on the stage, maybe even front page
Get a little fortune, have a little fame
Kill 'em with class, toast to the boogie while you fill up your glass
With my gangster ass, twenties
I used to pinch pennies
Only Gs, I don't fuck with no weenies
My clique is sick, it expandin'
What you gon' do
When we coming to a hood near you?
You know
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
What's beef? 'Cause beef is in the kitchen
What you want dog? I'm on a million-dollar mission
How can you get it if you ain't been through shit?
I'm just a seed that was planted by Ruthless
My family tree is so G, we was cut from the cloth called LBC
Crybaby, used to C-Walk at the park
Pitbulls on a leash that would never bark
Trip Locc, kinfolk, and Wayniac
"Duces 'n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way"
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
I used to come through with the tools and Glocks
Party don't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigga up out his shoes and socks
Yeah, certified official gangsta shit
Unfiltered, like a pack of humps, nigga
Detrimental to all and any that disrespect or deviate from the G calls
It's either hog status or buster status
It ain't no in betweens
You can't wake up and put this on, nigga
Every breath you breathe gotta be committed to this shit
It's all a part of that lifestyle we created back in the days for the world to follow
Gs up, forever
The boss dogg an' Tha General, front line and on the east side
High speed chase, 405 is the freeway
Slangin' my- bangin' my- swangin' my Coupe de Ville
Like that, right back, top of the hill
Wheel in my hand with a trunk full of contraband
Swimmin' under water like I'm Aquaman
I used to drink gin, now it's vodka, man
Boss Dawg is the baller, no propagand'
I'll pop yo band, don't try and stop the plan
Spaced out, caked out, no bug-a-boo
Flipped out, Cripped out, nigga, what it really do?
Time brings change, so I changed my name
Tryna take flight while they clippin' my wings
Groupie ass niggas, see you tripping again
With nothing to gain, plop plop, pop and I bang
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up

Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up
Thirty days later I'm back on the streets
Got a batch of bomb beach, shit I'm trying to eat
Feet to the pavement; money, I'm cravin' it
What about the bitches Dogg? Are you savin' 'em?
Can a blind man see? (No)
Can a shark survive outta water for a week? (No)
A snitch is a snitch if he solemnly speak
I don't know near nothin', I'm a product of the beach
To each his own, hard as stone
Lot of y'all niggas 'bout as hard as foam
Dead wrong, tryin' to sneak Tamika the phone
Step back nephew or feel the heat of the chrome
G-ma and PawPaw and the heat of my comb
Plate full of shit nigga, I never eat it alone
Heat it alone, then I put the weed in the bong
Step back at the feet of my throne mothafucka
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up
Cinematic, right back at it

When he popped back, everybody scattered, didn't matter
Movin' heavy weights, Klitschko
We the funk that killed disco
I showed you how to go and get this dough
But don't thank me, that's how the shit go
It's still banging Crypto from the intro
Nigga what they hidden fo'?
Hol' up, who is that tryin' to come through?
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper

Youse a hood rat
You get no dough
I wonder why I captured her sight, it had to been the ice
Brown skin, eyes weird like Russell Simmon's wife
Now I'm thinking 'bout busting in her twice
Brown color, corn bread, best customer in sight, aight
Louis Vutton shoes, getting cuffed, [?] a book
Big cup full of Hennessy
Nah, that bitch ain't my girl, just whenever I'm around she pretend to be
Look, I don't dance much (no)
If you're wondering why I'm pulling my pants up
My nympho lives on the edge and watches the WNBA
Wears braids and headbands, she cute plus her brain's sick
And she don't flip when I look at another chick
Cause she's looking at the same bitch
Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
(Yeah, oh yeah, there's something about you)

(Cause their ain't enough bars
I swear I ain't never told on nobody
It started in '82 at a 'hood house party
Half Ded, Lil' Loc and my nephew D
Not knowin' what we do, but this is RTC
Heart sparked, puttin' flags in Tucane Park
I leave the house for school, but I come back after dark
You feel me?
More power, more leadership - unifying Bloods and Crips
I used to smoke a pack a day, I used to have to pack a K
Now I've got brothers in suits in my faculty
Pushin' peace in the streets - North, West, South and East
Student of the game, yeah it's time to make a change
So I'm following, no more swine swallowin'
I'm gon' just walk the walk of a righteous man
As-salamu alaykum, sir
Yeah, that's the plan...
Yeah, I'm down with Obama just to add a little drama
Had a talk with my mama, had to let her know that I'mma
Make a change, and she said: "baby, go ahead and do that"
And he told me, so I'm teachin' brothers how to be peace
What's wrong? We too strong, and if we all get along
The enemy is always watching for leadership that will rise among black people because it is only by organizing effectively that you can change the reality under which we live
Yeah, this record is for my baby, my baby boo
And you say I don't ever make records for you no mo'
Yeah, real talk
Been around the worrrrrld
I done been to many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to youuuuu
I seen everything twice
Been around the world I seen every scene twice
Stompin' down in Tokyo, dippin' in the rice
I'm a boss at the wind, I cracked every color dice
I do it big, fuck the rumors
Gangstas don't die they just move to Miami
I did all that, I was voted my (?)
I'm somethin' like Sammy
Sippin' Chardonnay, makin' bills on my hands-free
Father Hood, now the actors can't stand me
Relax my mind and just chill
Soon as I get home I'm racin' to unplug my phone
Yeah, but now I'm back across the water
I'm in Sydney with somebody's daughter
Blowin' sticky by the zips
And they can tell by how my rag hang, nigga this Crip
But I'm chillin'; it feels so good to get away
Especially when your name is D-O-double-Gizzee
Coast to coast jettin', man I been doin that
What y'all just start ballin' Cuz? I been up out the trap
Poppin' P's with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck got an office
Dockin' down in Monaco, churchin' with my folks
Bad Lucc had me dyin' when he fell up out that boat
But the bad guy don't die at the end, so sue me
Then I relax and chill
Cause without you, none of this is real
Baby you know I
I done been to many places, seen some unfamiliar faces
But baby none of them compares to youuuuu
Soon as I get home I'm racin' to unplug my phone
I done been to many places, seen some unfamiliar faces

Reminiscing about the Fresh Fest back in '85
When the dubs and the San Dieg's used to hoo ride
After party on the lake at the big homie's house
Niggas coming realer than The Real McCoy
It's the gang of fly bitches, homiez on the switches
Dice in the back if ya wanna get your riches
No snitches allowed inside the crowd
Cause this is the G thang, East Side L.B.C. brang
Finna have some fun represent two-one
And bet nobody bring a mothafucking gun and a...
Yeah, King Park was the location
And to be a G, that was my destination

Nobody can see you, but you (yeah, the East Side's perfect)
Nobody can see you, but you (ha ha, now that's worth it)
Nobody can see you, but you (hell yeah, the East Side's perfect)
If ya bring a strap, then ya have to trip
We got meat to eat, (freaks to meet)
Strolling through the Park one day
Puffing on a fat ass J, with my homie named Tray
Deee tryin' to see if we could put this LBC thing
Back together like it was supposed to see
And if I have to sit ya, down then I spit ya
See I was regulating, when Cragars was the Daytons
Nigga let me interact with my black croaker sacks*
And a gray golf hat tilted to the back (what's up?)
Ditchin' Sunday school to get a pack of Now and Laters
While I'm rolling with the Steelers and killin' with the raiders
And when we bang with the Saints then we ain't no joke
Come around from outta bounds and we goes for broke
With a small dedication, to two-one street
Be next, Be NXT
Be mohawks, Be beards
Like no one, Like nothing
Like whatever, Like this
Like Asuka, Like Charlotte
Like Becky, Like Bliss
No tapouts, No count outs
No 3-counts, No friends
No now with, No then
One shot in one million
One versus all, One team
One Finn, One Balor
One demon, One king
B-R-A-Y
Like Jimmy, Like Jay
Like even this guy
No divas, No mud fights
No thanks
One Sasha, One Boss
One word, Banks
Be heard, Be seen
Like Dolph, Like Dean
No guts, No glory
One shot, One story
Be you
Like now
No time
One run
Be like no one
Celebrate, grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky
Worldwide, nigga it's 1999
Shit out of control, sign of the times
I ain't had this much fun since '79
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn'
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing
Playin' football up in Poly High
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside
Homicides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin much
Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end
Same dogg channel, same dogg time
Only the strong will survive in 99
So much drama and delusion, my conclusion is confusing
Drippin on my memories, twisted off my music
Tryin to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it
But them Westside niggas is the craziest (craziest)
Summertime on the grind, baby let me shine, let me shine
Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit in my prime
Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First thing first, cuz, stop smoking cess weed
But somehow someway
Better days ahead, Freddy's dead
I love confetti, I always stay ready
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow
Two down, with just one gun
My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Corleone
Tragically casualties and fatalities
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead
I never really understood what he said
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head
Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson
Slow down and go down, shit you know now
Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
But life's so hard on a G, that's what they all say
But somehow someway, you got to make a better way
(Somehow someway)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way
(Yeah, better days ahead)
(Better days ahead)
Better days ahead
That's real
I feel your pain nigga
I used to be just like you nigga
Before I got off in this rap shit
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar
You know, but one thing I never did do
I ain't never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing
So from me to you, man to man
Shit, keep the faith and get your hustle on
Cause I'm a get mine regardless
Nigga whether I'm rapping or on the streets
I gotta have it
For those who don't know just what to do
Let it be a blessing every day
Every step of the way
You don't have to be in fear of rejection
Know that it's only God's direction
No matter the religion or your faith
It's the Bible of love
Bible of love, Bible of love
Till the haters get the message
Bible of love, Bible of love, Bible of Love
I like big bitches cause they so large
Big bitches always take charge
Wanna grab a slim nigga like Snoop Dogg
But a big bitch gets shit that a nigga need
Always got the drink and somethin' on the weed
And I never have a muthafuckin' need no more
And every nigga that I know done fucked a fat-ass hoe, so
See ain't no reason for the Dogg to lie
I like it when they weigh about two-o-five
With all this shit goin' on nowadays
I'd rather have a big bitch cause she pays what she weighs
You know there is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' shit. There's always some big mouth motherfucker hatin'. Always a nigga hatin'. It's always somebody that's displeased with what you do. You can never make motherfuckers happy. There is always somebody unsatisfied that feels entitled. There is always some bitch on the sideline talkin' shit with her big mouth There is always some big mouth-ass nigga talkin' 'bout what you shoulda do with your money and what you coulda, woulda, shoulda - it's just... you understand me? Big Mouth with your big mouth ass!
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
There's a rumor being spread about me and my crew
About something we did or supposed to do
You might not of heard it or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
You can say what you want, just spell my name right
Cause all I'm ever guilty of is rockin' the house
So if you like to hate tell all your friends
And if you don't wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horses mouth
Right then and there we can straighten it out
Because I don't get involved with he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you ahead
I pull up and pop a cap in your ass
Big mouth (you too)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
People used to say that you got a big mouth
Because what we do is just between me and you
Not something that you run and tell your crew
But you had to told Sharon and she told Carol
Then the story rolled on just like a wheelbarrow
Carol told Bibi and she told Pam
And Pam was overheard a-talking to her man
Pam was so rookie, what she thought she heard
And somehow my nigga Diddy Bop got the word
He told somebody I knew from fruit town
They called me up and put me down
Now the whole damn story's been changed around
And that's the reason why I ain't fucking with you now
'Cause you never shoulda opened your mouth at all
And I wouldn't a had no reason to make this call
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
Now you're the dime-dropper of the neighborhood
Just like a snake rollin' on the ground
Looking for some new dirt to spread around
Now you're the dime-dropper of the neighborhood
And every time I see you up to no good
Just like a snake rollin' on the ground
Looking for some new dirt to spread around
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You got a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a motherfucker with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing cause the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this, bitch!
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
To the store, to get me a 4-0
So I head down the street to Long Beach
Just so I could meet, a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
'Cause a hoe's a trick
I don't love them tricks (Why?)
'Cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
And turnin' them trick ass hoes the fuck out, now
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
I'm back to the motherfucking county jail
I get's released on a hot sunny day
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
And already gotta do some motherfucking chin checking
Move up the block as we groove up the block
Kick in the do', I look on the flo'
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my hoe, yo (Bitches ain't shit)
I uncocked my shit, I'm heart-broke but I'm still loc'ed
Man, fuck a bitch!
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Get's the fuck out after you're done
And I hops in my ride to make a quick run
(Bitches ain't shit) I don't give a fuck about a bitch
'Cause I'm doing my own thing down with the swing
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thing
I say you know can't deal
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
They need to chill
Because I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck
And now I gotta do some
I gotta do some shit that's clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get real mean
Like a washing machine
I can wash the clothes
I ain't tryin' to say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones
With he tip of the tongue
And then their sprung
With the nuts hung
Bitches ain't shit
Yeah, time to bring your ass to the table, y’all
It’s X to the Z, Xzibit, yeah
Snoop double D, uh, OG
What
Coverin' up the world, right
Yeah, ha
Listen, look
You ain't tryna hot box with me, I swig hard liquor
Goin' down by the second round, all hail the underground
How that sound? Xzibit backin' down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense! Terrorist, here to bomb shit
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin'
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that?
For me? It's blasphemy, you fuckin' around
With the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk drivin', tryna stack my loot
While other rappers gettin' "Treated Like a Prostitute"
So check the SoundScan
All I wanna be was a G, ha!
My whole life, nigga please, ha!
Breakin' off these motherfuckin' keys, ha!
Let's get these motherfuckin' G's, ha!
Nigga, you don't wanna fuck with this
Hmm, oh no, big Snoop Dogg
Back up in the heezy, baby
You jockin' my style? You so crazy
Dre say, ain't "No Limit" to this
Look here bitch, you fine and I dig your style
Come fuck with a nigga and do it doggy style
I'll be gentle, sentimental
Shit, we fucked in the rental
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago
(Yeah, nigga, you know what's happenin', man) I get this pussy everywhere that I go
(These bitches know what time it is) Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know (Hell yeah)
(Hoes know about a nigga like me, man) I get this pussy everywhere that I go
Bitch please! Get down on your god damn knees
For this money, chronic, clothes and weed (Look)
Look, you fuckin' with some real O.G's, bitch please
Bitch please, get down on your motherfuckin' knees
Yeah, you fuckin' wit' some real OG's, you dick tease
Bitch, please! Now what you need to do is
Different strokes (Huh-uh) for different folks
Oh, you like settin' niggas up and gettin' them locs?
A cute lil' bitch with a whole lotta heart
Shit gets thick when the light gets dark
She say she got a lick for me (Well, hook it up)
Worth about 200 G's and 30 ki's!
Now check this out, Dre: now, if I don't move
But you know me, Dogg, I'm movin'!
Ain't nothing to it but to get to groovin'
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
See we go out with a bang (Bang, bang)
I'm tryin' to work this cold thang
And take this whole thang
I get the money everywhere that I go (I go)
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho (Fo' sho)
I get the money everywhere that I go (I go)
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho (Fo' sho)
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming D.P.G. 'til the day I D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming D.P.G. 'til the day I D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming D.P.G. 'til the day I D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming D.P.G. 'til the day I D-I-E
Blasten
Niggas drivin round with they tanks and they shotguns
The only way I'm quittin if you bitches get me killed
Blasten
Niggas drivin round with they tanks and they shotguns
Screams of the room it gives me chills as i pop one
Left that boy bloody red
"Why'd you leave him layin there?"
Cause he ran, then he said
Take this bread and make the spread
Break it up, and nigga don't be scared
I was only there prepared
I began to see that he was fucking round with the feds
Locin round to get inside a real rider
40 consolidated to 44
They said he singin like a bird everywhere he go
Case is over, more pain but no pay
And these the G's that been fuckin up the gangbang
We all got one, nigga not one
Nigga pop one, got a shotgun, nigga drop one
You see me? That's Snoopy Whodini
Makin niggas dissapear, then pop em back in black teenies
To me, I keen satan but keep that on the low
Load it up, and we already foe
And they already know
Turn the page
Shoot it quick
This we ride
This we wild
Doggy on some other shit
Bet he won't
Pop a nigga
Let he know
Don't get caught
Keep it g
Keep that thing by my side
Who we shootin?

Can't keep up
Loc' he got a cold stroke
Meantime, me and my
We just gon' let it go
Ay, what you thinkin' for?
Everybody in and out of L.A
And rats on the plizzot
And plus we got to deal with these crooked ass cizzops
Aw no, the screams of a mother cry
And blaze and flames in the scenes of a homocide
My very first gat was a fucking deuce-deuce
In the hood late night like i had some juice
Practiced my aim up in the back yard
Had the flash on fools that scooped the heat
How I got my mothafuckin' name in the street
By now a nigga was straight bangin'
380 in a stash spot, dash for the regal
Now rolling with the pistol was so illegal
But niggas was dying so, so fuck that
They in they league, got one and get your gat
Now it's 9's and AK's
And all kinds of shells where a dead body lays
But never take it as a threat
Life is just like a baseball game, three strikes you're out, no doubt
Curveballs, knuckles, sliders, and heaters
You gotsta stay on your toes and keep your eyes on their dick beaters
They greet us, like they down with our leaders
Hmm, weed is-
Kick back, relax, and blaze like saks back to back
I mix the gin with Hen
Penitentiary and the graveyard got my homeboys but I refuse to let 'em back me in
Nigga, that's what's happenin'
Right hand on my heater, left hand on my balls
I'm screamin' "fuck the laws"
Dogg bones and paws
Drinkin' cans of 8 balls with the muthafuckin' straw
Tilted, leanin'
Hoes tryna get at a nigga, security screen 'em
We dem G's, just C's, no fleas
We beez the epitome of rap, D-O-double-G's
The biggest, the realest niggas speak on it
Spent about a week on it
Season, marinate, tryna get it tight
Now I got that shit tight
Let me spit it tonight
Bust a bad bitch on sight
Skeet on her face and then I gotta catch a flight
At 8:30 in the mornin' wit' my nigga Dwight
Who got a show for a nigga?
Who got some dope for a nigga?
Love it or leave it, I'll take her home and beat it
I love it when a bitch act conceited
That's when I tell her I don't need it
See I can pass it
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin' classic
Bitch don't ya know?
I put the G in the P and put the C in the rolls
But you know, 'nuff said
Pass the 40 of the oh-ee
I'm takin' it to the head
Fuck the laws
Dogg bones and paws
Drinkin' cans of 8 balls with my muthafuckin' straws
The biggest, the realest niggas speak on it
You got a thousand on it? nigga I got a freak on it
Uh that's how we doin' this shit for the 2000 y'all
New millennium, keep it gangsta y'all

Oooh, you smell that?

He brought me through hard trials
He brought me through tribulations
Never let a day go by and not realize
He looked out for me
Never let a day go by and not realize we are blessed
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored
He brought me through hard trials
He brought me through tribulations
Had not been for the Lord who was on my side
Back was against the wall
He looked out for me
He heard my cry and rescued me
Never let a day go by and not realize we are blessed
Don't take it for granted that we are here today
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored
Just know that we're blessed and highly favored
As I look back through the years
It's amazing how He kept me
God turned it around
Turned it around just for my good
I know that I am blessed and highly favored
Let us think about it for a minute
It woulda' been me if it wasn't for the blood
Grace, mercy
Grace, mercy
I am blessed and highly favored
I-I am blessed and highly favored
I-I am blessed and highly favored
I am blessed-blessed and highly favored

He lifts me up, he's blessing me again (he's blessing me again)
I took a chance for real, so I can dance up in heaven
But how could I see what she's saying?
When I was seven I didn't wanna go to hell so I kept steppin'
Reppin', for the lord, no weapon will be formed
Sunshine, on the grind, take me through the storm
Seems like he testing me again
But on the flip side, it's like he blessing me again
Oh, you better come on now

I got the pi-doun, so sit down and listen to me
Don't go against me fool, go wit me
Yeah, we got something in common
They could search a nigga, but they never finding my bomb and
I got the stash, spot, my cash got
Lot of motherfuckas pulling, police shots
I'm not "The One" nigga you could call me "The Two"
Emancipated, concentrated, debated, rated many times
You suprised how I made it, huh?
You hate it, huh, but you know, I ain't even trippin
I'm spliting that Swisha up, plotting on the come up
I'm living my life, and never putting my gun up
Dranking my drink, and I'mma smoke that blunt
The greener the tree, the better the bud
The strength of the branch, will tell you how chronic it was
It's all to the good, the dash is wood
But, they frontin and fakin, and time is waistin
She don't wanna give ya number now she hollin at Jason
Now don't get mad, just roll to the pad
And keep a G on the bitch and roll another dub bag
(My nigga) light that shit, hit that bitch
Then past it to ya homie like playa, pimp (blaze that bitch)
And when you get dizzone, crack the do'
And let me get a little snizzle
Puff, puff, pass my nigga, one lizza
Come and keep me company
Baby come and fuck with me
It's the diabolical, chronical, mythological
Psychological, make a model ho, fuck a G
Pre-medical, steady slow those, ready can get it
Teacher taught it to those with mind apparatus
I'm that nigga that brought y'all the info
On the Chucks, French braids, and endo
Big Snoop Dogg with the fog on the window
Spell ya name in it, put ya face in it
And hang with the nigga with the gang bang spinach
Drag it, blunt wrap it, or zig-zag it
Don't really matter even if it's in the package
I'm tryna bounce wit the whole ounce (smoke me out)
Do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya, do ya
Do you think that you could fuck with weed (Star Trak)
(Yeah Pharrell this that shit right here)
And BBC - nigga
Dranking our drank
Ya dig what I'm sayin?
We ain't gon' never sing
We gon' still flow
That's real shit, Pharrell you my loc'
Neptunes, Star Trak
(It blows my mind)
Billionaire Boys Club, DPG
Doggy Style Records, ooh wee
(It blows my mind)..
Watch it, watch it - Kurupt is comin
And there'll be no more waitin
Watch it, watch it - Doggystyle is comin
Iffa eedyot ever disrespectin, nowww..
Now follow me deep in the depths of my mind
Think how many plots blossoms to how many times
I'm sedatin my asphixiated from beginnin broke
And the bombest weed smoke that'll make a nigga choke
To my loc's way down in the Valley deep
To my homies in the Pound from L.A. and the Beach
With these silly-ass bitches out for a niggas riches
A big shout out, to my niggas in Darby Twp
The homies catchin cases robberies and assaults
It ain't my fault that my shit might hit like that
Now when a nigga gotta mash for his he can't stop
Gotta get somewhere
My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself
Put 'em to rest, confess, nevertheless
Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best
For the simple fact with contact, we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle I'll mistreat
Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
I got the flavor, and I'm major
Busta-ass niggas can't stop us, and can't fade us
Shady-ass niggas can't stand next to ya
Swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I betcha I won't let ya escape, face the real on point
I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MC's try to step they get lit and blown
At the end the lights go out so before they do
I'm a L-B-C on through, stayin true
Demandin my respect, respect is what I've given
To the point of no return - so the streets I roam
Don't catch chrome to the dome of this flack black
Whistle, and watch all my homeboys come
Run, or hear the click, damn that shit that you get hit with
This is pre-meditated dick-up
To all the busters that jealous and hate it, but can't fade it
With they every attempt they fail,oh well
Consequences get suffered
I put pressure on sucker motherfuckers
The bill is crisp (the deal is) the deal is this
I gotta plot 'em on a mash for my chips
Get in my way and get stepped on
With subjects all subject to harm, when I swarm through
Who knew about the real deal I conceal?
And still, can you feel, the topic of the whole situation is trust
No ho is a must
If I bust my brain constructs to form knowledge to the max
Defeatin and deletin elevation set backs
We wax tracks and smack up MC's who compose the violence
Bringin drama, with no parental guidance
Eyes went deceived, somethin up my sleeve to intrigue
Also D-P-G's and, L-B-C's when
We do the do to you so go call your crew
Conflict will be verbal, so watch how you speak
Sleepless acts that's bomb to ya, suffer from insomnia
And I'ma, gonna be comin for you
So please be on the lookout for the Doggystyle Crew
It's a sucker MC barbecue cookout
Look out.. watch out now!
Ha-ha yeah, witcha bad self, watch out!

Chilling with the stars, where the bottles never stop
Got a model on my lap, baby show me what you got

Girls who like girls, wanna do it to daddy
One more drink gonna lead to sex
These girls is bad, the floor is packed
They shut the door down when it reach the max

Turn up the volume, adjust the game

Big Snoop Dogg is a Boss Playa
This is the Archbishop Don Magic Juan
Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (Pimp game)
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" like my nigga Pootie Tang
I got that bounce, to make her booty sway
That little cutie thang, 'Fred, she's a beauty, mayne' (Ooh wee)
Rollin' with a player 'cause that's what he was
On his bitches hard as feezuck
He got the heata-fa-heata and the keysa
With a pocket full of big faced Visas
They say it's cheaper to keep her, now baby, ease up
Kick back and blaze some of these trees up
Now sit your ass in the treezuck
And do me a favor and turn the music up
Should I slap her, or should I freak her?
Speak when spoken to, yeah, I broke a few
Had a freak for me and a freak for you
I make 'em do for us
That thang you been wantin' her to do for months
Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (Pimp game)
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (Pimp game)
And to me, you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
Holla at 'em, Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang
I got that bounce, to make her booty sway
That little cutie thang, 'Fred, she's a beauty, mayne' (Ooh wee)
This is the Chairman of the Board
The Archbishop Don Magic Juan
Big Snoop Dogg is a boss playa
As a matter a fact
I was there when he was crowned 'Boss Playa', church
I had three on my right arm and four on my left
Lime green and gold, we was sharp to death (Ooh wee)
Playin' this game, you can holla at the ref
And call a timeout before you put your dime out
Stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out
And go to the "Wizard of Oz"
And tell 'em that your tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart
A brand new start
'Cause you realized that you hadn't played your part
And that was smart
And break these bitches from state to state
See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate
I ain't ask for it, homie, I just shake and bake
I won't fake to make you buy my tape
I say a prayer to the Lord just to keep my faith up straight
Many people don't be knowin' about this pimp game (Pimp game)
And to me, you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played
Holla at 'em, Doggy Dogg, go and do that thang
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" like my nigga Pootie Tang
I got that bounce, to make her booty sway
That little cutie thang, 'Fred, she's a beauty, mayne' (Ooh wee)
Will you steal for me? (Yes I will)
Will you kill for me? (Yes I will)
Will you steal for me? (Yes I will)
Would you lie to me? (Never)
Would you die for me? (Whenever, whenever)
Big Snoop Dogg, lets you know
That this game ain't for no lame
If you got heart, you can play this game
But if your heart ain't right
We got a remedy for that, too
And the Archbishop Don Magic Juan is the Wizard
Boss Playa ... Boss Playa ... that's what this game is all about
Boss Playa
But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game (Pimp game)
And to me, you know it ain't no motherfuckin' thang
To give it to you plain and simple 'cause you know it's played
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" like my nigga Pootie Tang
That little cutie thang, 'Fred, she's a beauty, mayne' (Ooh wee)
Gangsta, Gangsta, where you been?
Round the corner messin' with brotha'n'em
Youngsta, Youngsta, you at it again?
Poppin' gats for the fuck of it, when you know you got ends
I don't think that you should be in the streets like that
You know you the fashion type of cat
Doin' things, bling bling
West Coast runnin', lovin', hustlin' smokin', always chokin' indo green
With the sticky in your hand, fo sho
Everybody 'round ya 'cause they know you got mo'
You like to dip in your 6' n shit
Rollin' through them streets, poppin' CPT
LBC rollin' with me, ohh
Some of 'em lie about the shit they got and what they do on the block
Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me cause I live a boss' life
So many niggas wanna play but still got dues to pay
Some of 'em gotta beg a bitch to stay
But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't
That's how it is for me cause I live a boss' life
And the G's puttin' work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really, a pocket full of women
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'mma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin' pimpish
And it's comin' from the Beach where them niggas is a beast
I'm connected to the purse first nigga, the ass last
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish
I got the kinda swagger that you ain't used to
Me, I'm ridin' by ya on the corner, block slangin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
The hoes come runnin' when they see me comin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
You can have anything just don't fuck with my money
This is for the West and the East and the Dirty South
When you in Magic City you be carrying a lot of clout
But trickin' ain't the route, that's even if you got it
There's a method to you holdin it when they can't do without it
If she a baller, she gon' ride with a shot caller
Roll with the Boss Dogg in the back of a blue Impala
And if she follow, then she gon' swallow
All the game you got to give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
'less I knew that she was 'bout him, havin' diamonds on his collar
I'm just an author, spreading game to my partners
See me man, I'm nothin like you
I'm leanin' in my ride, fo' fifth, cock bangin'
Me, I'm ridin' by ya on the corner, block slangin'
I'm livin' that boss' life
The hoes come runnin' when they see me comin'
Snoop: Ya playa
Snoop: That's some real pimp shit right here
Snoop: These bitches is outta line man
Man: What's the matter dog you can't control your bitches?
Snoop: Check this out man
(chorus: kokane)
I got bitches all in my game that don't even know my name
Biotch!
Then pump your brakes, you hoes
Biotch!
You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one, whooo
You are sexy, sexy, sexy, you are so sexy
You are the one, you are the one
You are the one, you are the one, you are the one, whoo-oo
You are sexy, sexy, sexy, hmmm
Tereka and Erika, they love to take care of a
Real motherfucker from the DPG
Keesha, Resha, Tammy and Renesha
I appreciate the way y'all skate
When the clock hit eight
Now April and Kate
Y'all be doin' too much
Running your mouths
Fuckin shit up, you gotta get up
Cus I done had enough
Getting sick and tired of the same stuff
You told Kamil and she told Karla
And she told April and now they all know
So, all that confronting the real nigga on site
Today is today, last night was last night
As I leaned with my hand on my balls
I had to really check these bitches and tell 'em like this dog
(chorus)
Nina do this and Tina do that
Sabrina, Sakina, nigga them all my hood rats
At an early age man, I was on the cock
Non-stop, I beat it up and tell that bitch to get ghost
(They be like hot butter on a breakfast toast)
Hollarin' out, poppin' a collar out
And talkin' shit on the phone to me at my baby-mama's house
(who's she?) Look here bitch do you know who the fuck I am
You better read your motherfuckin' press telegram
Had to cut the bitch up 'cus she tried to get too close to me
Fuckin' with her friend, a fake bitch (Is that right?)
But you know I had to stop and I paused
And I put my hand on my balls and said check this out, dog
(chorus)
I got my own spot and I got my own keys
So can't no bitch talk shit to me
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessin' or stressin'
I got another bitch and she was at the convalescent home
Shit I needed a chaperone plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But in no time at all seems she fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Topcat had to scat
I hit her friend from the back
I was jerkin' that skirt
And when she found out she told me that that shit hurt (boo-hoo)
A week later she fucked my homeboy Kurt
(chorus x2)
(shoop)
{*Music fades out*}
Breathe it in, breathe it out
Breathe it in, breathe it out
Breathe it in, breathe it out
We smoke good good, you smoke sour
You got lights out, well we got power
Ask your girlfriend, she knows how I
Blew about a zip in my Eddie Bauer
I like fist fights, you need two Glocks
You rock bullshit, while we knock 2Pac
This that high five, yep that fire
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah and I'm gon' die high
We got Obama, and we blow kush
We blow bubble kush, while you smoke bullshit
Ask my nephews, up in the yay yay
This your highlight, so get your shit right
And this that real talk, so get that shit right
Your kids and your mama, they say that they love me
Cause I am the big dog, and you just a puppy
I got big game, you got nada
You like white girls, so you sniff powder
Weigh that bag light, and play that flash light
This your last night, now get my cash right
I am King Kong, you just a baby cub
I got long dong, and you got baby nuts
Smoke with Snoop Dogg, I don't think so
You got outdoor, I like indo
I am legendary, you are temporary
You smoke stress for less, we smoke blueberry
Why you pop that, young nigga you ain't got that
If you need that, turn on your headlights
Cause I got that shit to get your head right
Now, smell the smiso, I got diesel
Spread the weed smur', I'm high as a beezurd'
She likes Lebron, he likes Kobe
Well I like Baron Davis, cause that's my homie
Not what you smoke, cause you smoke bunk dope
How many T signs, must I relate back
If you ain't got kush, then please don't say that
We get down here, your weed got brown hair
And that's the kind of weed that we don't smoke round here
See, you smoke red hair, we smoke that there
You got whack shit, and we got cat piss
We like swisher sweets, you like back woods
Your weed got seeds, and you think that's good?
Boy you so lost, I am so boss
I got Q.P.'s, to me that's no cost
D.O. double G, L.B.Cizzne'
I guess this will be the death of me
And if it do so, then let my lungs lay
Cause I'm in heaven blowing seven's of O.G
Can't you see, I'm straight OG (OG)
Oh c'mon
Shit, I'm qualified to knock a hoe no matter where ever I go
Excuse me partner, this the pimpin' let a pimpin pimpin' let you go
Break the bitch you say "I will"
Then nigga, shit; since you put it like that
I'm about to lace em right now nigga
And take them straight to the track (track)
I've never let a bitch pimp me
Trying to tell me what to do but I'mma stay O.G
Fresh out the pen only 32 days (32 days)
And I added and subtracted in a multiplied way
Now switch worlds
Why did the little girl walk around with a gold fish in her pocket
And check the one with the fast mouth
Just get your money if you have to knock her motherfucking ass out
I don't care whatcha do
Long you don't fuck with mine (C'mon sing it ya'll)
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time
Old "Blue Eyes," Dogg Sinatra
The Glock cocker, hoe hopper, show stopper
I'll put you in a brick in a building
And separate you from your children (Daddy)
I stay G'd up
All the G's from my set ain't never PC'dup (hahaha)
If you hit the main line
You gonna get stompped
Paying motherfuckers off use a sucka duck
Me and my niggas go hard in the paint
Puttin paint where it ain't, makin bitch niggas faint
Throw your set up and wave it from (Rolling) side to c-side
Banging on you cuz, nigga this crip
I got so many tricks up my sleeve (Oh y'all ain't knowin')
You wanna bang let's bring it on (Oh Oh)

I don't care whatcha you do (I don't care what the fuck whatcha do)
Long as you don't fuck with mine (As long you don't fuck with mine)
You think you can't be touched (Uhhhhh)
No, I don't love you bitch, you a hoe, I never will (Never will)
Can't tell you my feelings cause the pimpin' don't feel
Bitch, matter fact be gone
Fuck around and have your Momma saying "Baby, he wrong!"
Talking about he a real pimp
Bitch, is gumbo laced with the proper crop of jumbo shrimp
Stepped out the pen with my hoe, got it crackin with my hoe
Steady mackin with my hoe, now I'm stackin with my hoe
I pop a bottle of Mo
About to model a hoe
I'm working them, serving 'em and breaking 'em off (You know)
Did the weed, man get here
Taking too long
But when he get here dogg
I'm taking a zone (Give it up nigga)
Niggas know how D-O-double G "doo's it"
Known for making that crip hop music, don't abuse it
Just ride to the rhythm of a pimp ass, upper class, cold motherfucker
(Humming) Long you don't fuck with mine
You think you can't be touched
Niggas disappear all the time (Humming)

I told you niggas from the start
If I'm still in it, I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my motha fuckin' game tight
Cause ever since Elementary, or was it Pre-school Quik?
I had to have papers it was routine
A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens
Break Niggas
Make niggas, shank theyselves
For fuckin with my wealth (nigga)
And it'll catch on
And, cuzz, I ain't even slippin' when I'm all alone
Sittin' back loungin' in the Chronic Zone
Clown me ya gone
Surround me, it's on
Get the money you're gone
My niggas' paper so long
So if you want me, get me, got me
Should have shot him
But now they call me Snoop Gotti
And that's all I LBC
Betta yet, that's all I DPGC
Chorus (2x)
Verse Two:
I'm slappin' bones
In front of my home
Choppin' game on the phone
Big 6, big 5-3's with ya bitches
My girls in the kitchen, cookin' up some fish and
I'm blastin' at this nigga that was trippin'
O, knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin'
I blast his ass, peck peck now his shirt's wet
Dead, gone, light's out
With no remorse, I had to take him out
Fuckin' with the dogg I take your life and your money
And then I dip to my spot (dip dip)
And set up shop with yo rocks (motha fucka)
Cause still, all doggs go to heaven
Chorus (2x)
Verse 3:
I'm freestylin'
C-stylin'
Snoop and Quik comin' through we fin' to take you to the island
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts
People be lovin' me because I drop cuts
That makes sense, it make big money
See Snoop is that nigga who don't hafta play funny
But I got yo honey, up under my wing
Cause she like the song that the bow-wow sing
I'll put her in a cling
I won't buy her a ring
And even if she never even saw me befo'
There's just no way that she can tell me no
And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me
Chorus (2x)

Melissa Brista in San Francisca
The cute little sista with the feet for blista
Hey, they say that I'm like Mr. Bigsta
All these bullshit moves to miss us
But I'mma finish her on the ground until it's done
Knives and silly clubs - hoes and fake thugs
Pimps, players and all the above

Yeah, that's bangin' loco (For shizzle)
Comin' thru scriptures; straight your ditchas
And they wanna french kiss us

And if you get in, you might get a picture (come on)
So sit your shit down, go on and get down

Burn it up me, keepin' your hot spot hot
Turn it up me, shake what you got - you got a lot
Burn it up me, keepin' your hot spot hot
Turn it up me, shake what you got - you got a lot
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shinin' and gettin' Grammy's
But these streets won't say goodbye
I can't say goodbye (To the blocks)
Goodbye (To the hood)
Goodbye (To the streets)
Goodbye (To the blocks)
Goodbye (To the streets)
I can't say goodbye (To the blocks)
Goodbye (To the streets)
Goodbye (To the hood)
I can't say goodbye (To the hood)
Goodbye (To the homies)
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out the homeboy
Plus my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got locked, and we don't know
If he comin' home boy
The industry tell me, just leave it alone boy
Let them do them, take care of your own boy
But I sit back, think about, before I was grown boy
Then had dreams of bein' a doe boy
Yeah I was runnin' from the po-po, bangin' for the turf
Late night huntin', puttin' in work
Hood day comin', airbrushed shirt
Payday at the spot, got my haircut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
See I live in the 'burbs but I think 21st
To the blocks that raised me
The enemies and the homies that made me
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me
Critics wonder if I'm tryin' to be the old me
Then they don't really know me
And gon' know we don't change, we just become O.G
You always addicted to the life, you just don't O.D
But shit, I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my mama didn't want me
Too wild to be her child, and pops not around
Now all I got now is the homies
To teach me, how to be a man and what not
How to break ounces into grams and what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands and what not
Shit, you think I forgot? Nah
Thank God every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more awards to get
That made me who I am, the music and the man
Told me that I can before the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub in the pen with my man
All I had was the block when I didn't have fans
Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all came down, my career was to end
I'm sure my name would live, in these streets
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the streets (to my problems)
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
To the hood
I can't say goodbye
To the hood
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the homies
VERSE (SNOOP DOGG):
I guess it's true, you can't take the hood out a homeboy
Plus, my hood just lost another homeboy
Another one got life, and we don't know, if he coming home boy
They in the street tell me "just leave it alone boy
Let them do them take care of your own boy"
But I said back brake a bound, before I was grown boy
You had dreams of being a dope boy
Yeah, I was runnin' from the po po
Puttin' me in work, good day comin', airbrush, shirt
Pay day, got the spot, got my hair cut first
Made mom sick when I wouldn't go to church
Yeah I live in the burbs, but I think 21st
I know since I left that it's gotten much worse
But I'd still be there, if I couldn't write a verse
CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say a goodbye
VERSE (SNOOP DOGG):
To the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the homies that made
Me, tough enough to hang on the corners that would mould me
Critics wonder if I'm tryna be the old me
And don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you always addicted
To the life, you just don't OD, shit I owe the streets before they owe me
Took me in when my momma didn't want me, to wild to be a child, and pops
Not around now, all I got now is the homies, to teach me, how to be a man
In what not, how to brake ounces in the grams in what not
The reason I'm so nice with my hands in what not shit, you think I forgot, man naw
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye
VERSE (SNOOP DOGG):
Thank god every day that the boy could spit
And all around the world they enjoyin' my shit
I know I got plenty more wars to get
I got a, beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas sayin' stick to the plan
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand
Probably be doin' a dub and the pen with my man
All I had was the block, when I didn't have fans
Rapped on the corners when I couldn't get spins
All I had was the homies when I didn't have kids
If it all come down and my career was to end, I'm sure my name
Would live.. in these streets
CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
I'm a man I gotta take care of my family
Fighting these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammies
But these streets won't say goodbye
I just can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
You can take the man out the streets
But you can't take the streets out the man
Niggas, get ya Miller Genuine Draft, cause it's Miller Time
We 'bout to go hard on these hoes with this one right here
Can you control yo ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yo ho
She hard-headed and she just won't obey
Can you control yo ho?

You got to put that bitch in her plaaacce
Even if it's slappin' her in her face
You got to control yo ho..
Can you control yo ho?
I went to your house
Your girl came in and started cussin' you out
You shoulda slapped her in her face
I wanted to tell you, but it wasn't my place
I kept on the low
Cause I knew that you was gonna check that ho
But you were quiet as a mouse
Made me start to think that it wasn't your house
Cause she was acting like a nut
What kind of pimp holds back
Never met a bitch that a pimp can't slap
What's wrong with the pimpin'
Why you gettin' a whippin'
Can you control yo ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yo ho
She hard-headed and she just won't obey
Can you control yo ho?
You got to know what to do and what to say
Listen
You got to put that bitch in her plaaacce
You got to control yo ho..
Can you control yo ho?
This is what you made me do
I really didn't wanna put hands on you
I'm so sick and ti-ired
Of loud mouth bitches like you
A nigga had to go and put tips on you
Cause bitch you playing with fi-ire
I'm so sick and ti-ired
This is what you made me do
I really didn't wanna put hands on you
But, bitch you playing with fire
I'm so sick and tired
Of loud mouth bitches like you
So a nigga had to go and put tips on you
Cause bitch you playing with fire
Can you control yo ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yo ho
She hard-headed and she just won't obey
Can you control yo ho?
You got to know what to do and what to say
Listen
You got to put that bitch in her plaaacce
Even if it's slappin' her in her faaace
I been across the whole U.S.A
Same ol' hoes on different days
Just ask my big homeboy Snoop de Snoop
Xxxxx you ain't cute, with all that (woop de woop)
I might just rock ya, I ain't afraid to blast
Grip the heater and slap your ass
Xxxx it back, automatic clap your ass
Now this is how a gangster mash out
The homies in the Coupe, me and Snoop in the glass house
Chorus: Snoop
Yeah, and all my niggas say... ride, ride on
Yeah, and all the honies say... ride on
(repeat 2X except last line)
I'm out to paper count the paper bump some xxxxxxx and move
I take a trip with my click on a three day cruise
Spank the corner in the fo', sittin low gettin low
Now we headed to the sto' in the fo', hoes holler
Top dollar with the gold flea collar
Dippin in my blue Impala
They say Snoop Dogg is a fool, cause he got the bitches
And the little homey sellin weed up outta high school
I never ever break the law, I just bend it
Keep everything splendid, that's how I intend it
Class is in session, you might get suspended (shhhh)
If you don't shut the xxxx UP and listen for a minute
I been in it for life, with two kids and a wife
With no tattooes just stress and stripes, so
I'ma do what I feel and do what I like
But I won't go to sleep without my heater at night (ride on)
Chorus
Nigga gimme erything you got, from your hat
To your contacts, t-shirt to your socks
Dogg Pound affiliate? Hell naw nigga
Certified branded Cedar Paul nigga
Mashin, grey and, blue all day
All night all heated with heaters, mac-11's
I got a xxxxx that gobble up dicks like steak
Near a one of those xxxxxxx is proper, stash the chopper
DPology (DPG) but first call Snoop
Whattup big homey niggas with the swoop
When we get there, we shakin all xxxxxxxxxxxx down
Hit the spot just like a raid one of the homies got a gauge
Come on
Chorus
Let me holler at y'all for a minute man
I mean this game is gettin real deep
We got niggas that be misrepresentin
I mean, xxxxxxxxxxxxx you know thinkin that DPG

Nigga this ain't no game, this is a motherfuckin way of life
DPGC, Dogg Pound Gangsta... nigga!
Niggas be straight tryin to put they little twist down (holla at em)
But you know we tryin to stay two steps ahead of the game baby, y'know?
Let me holler at y'all for a minute, especially YOU
You done stepped in some Dogg Shit, check your shoes
Nigga this ain't Hollywood, the House of Blues
It's the Dogg House, so regroup your troops
And tell em... it's Kurupt and Snoop
It's Don Corleone in the Chronic zone
I turn your dubs into nickels, while I'm chillin
I melt your rhymes into icicles, while I'm killin
Sell em, I tell em, Kurupt, what's up
I know you feel like, givin it up
We can't stop, won't stop, what foe
Cause every other day another nigga tryin to pull a dulo
It was all bad, thought it was all good
A nigga had to take a breather

Xxxx a feeding fish, I put my dick in your bitch
Nigga that's gangsta shit, with the gangsta twist
Yeah, Dogg Pound gangsta...
Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle

A couch was a nigga bed

Twenty first a nigga, yeah that's where a nigga live

So when you get your funk, go take to the store
Guaranteed to get your shit up off the flo'

Verse 3
Everybody in my family is nervous and waitin'
How can I be patience?
They ain't the ones that gonna be riding to the station
So it what it all boils down to just some inspiration
Interpretation, the conversation you had with the judge
We are living in a world
And if you ain't up on the game
Then I suggest you rearrange
Cause change gone come
And it ain't waitin on no one
For all the drama I done went through
To get this to ya
You coundn't be cause ever since its been DP

I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have, I never will
I tell a bitch like this
"Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without the Bluenotes;
You'll never go platinum"
Hey Daz, give me a light, nigga
Good Morning boys and girls, I'm your substitute teacher, Mr. Buckwort. The topic fo' today is, what you wanna be when you grow up. You, over there in the jean shirt, what you wanna be when you grow up?
"I wanna be a police officer"
"I would like to be a fire man"
Alright, that's a pretty good profession too
"My name is Snoop"
Alright Snoop, what you wanna be when you grow up?
"I wanna be a motherfuckin hustla, ya betta ask somebody"
I had seen a lot of niggers come up in this game
But never did they make the look so good
From candy cars to bright yellow bras
The gangster white walls and the wood
You see, there comes a time in a man's life
Where you gotta choose the goods of the game
Where everybody knows your name
It's a cold game, I ain't been one to
Jump in and out of the range
Maybe an old school synagogue
Spinnin' the vision from which I faint
You got to do it, you can, gotta keep rhymin'
East Side High enjoyin' life, hair blowin' in the wind
The state that I'm in is gangster bliss
This is what you're callin' a sis
Passin' them off quick, memories missed
In fact, I got better, clutchin' on Beretta's
Blowin' a sticky, turn it to whether
And I never be questioned by some new young chump
Poppin' their toss, Snoopy D.O. made the way for you to walk
Owe it to the almighty, without you it couldn't be done
Your praise put the rise of the son, you dig?
Hold closer my hands from my throne
And I never be crucified within my own zone
From almost goin' down for murder in '93
I changed, I got smarter, I got a daughter
Two sons, beautiful wife for starters
I did it all, Jack, poppin' this peas
Eatin' international cuisine overseas, yeah
You never tried to know Calvin, you tried to groove me up
Did so much shit for the Coast, I should get a check
But all in all, I did it, B, cool as a blind with a C
Leveled my life as I push away the groupies
Snoopin' in a coopin', you can call me Uncle Snoopy
Take your chances, still from the L, B, C
For you are the C
Haler at you're the Snoopy
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
There's a time and place for everythin'
I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
There's a time and place for everythin'
And now it's time to make a change
Gotta make that move
There's a time and place for everythin'
Take your chances, still from the L B C
For you are the C
Haler at you're the Snoopy
Haler at you're the Snoopy
That you had to trust like this and pray like that
You might feel that all you done, that's going too far (Going too far)
I just want you to know, that God's not tripping on your clothes
He is more concerned about your soul and your heart
I don't have a Heaven or Hell, to get you in my friend
(He loves us all) Yes, he does (He love me, He)
So give him your heart, it's a very good start
And come as you are
No matter if you're from the street
Repent your sense of honestly
Just come as you are (Come as you are)
Don't have to drive a fancy car, or dress like your a movie star
Just come as you are (Come as you are)
Over here, you have a voice
Rejoice and make a joyful noise
Come as you are (Come as you are)
Give him all the glory, we can live and tell the story
Wherever you comin' from, *let's lift our hands as one*
He'll tell us well done, we're all his daughters and sons
Let's make the world much better
Just come as you are
I know, you told him you was leavin'
I know, They called you a Heathen
I know, and nobody said wait child don't go
I know, you know what to believe in
I know, and the teacher ain't teaching
I know, yeah (you know)
I know, that when you wake up
You know, that it's not your own air that your breathing
You know, when you think it over, that's he's brought ya over
No matter if you're from the street
Repent your sense of honesty (Repent and be honest)
(Come as you are) (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't have to drive a fancy car (no no), or dress like your a movie star (hey)
Rejoice and make a joyful noise (A)

Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood
Heyyyyyyeahhhheyyyy

When you feel your life's too harrr-arrrrrd
Just go have a talk with Go-ooooood... yeahhhheyyyy

And you can catch me down on my knees, askin' the Lord please
Even Jes' pray, hey, with difficulty comes ease
There's disease, poverty, congestion or oppression
I'm askin' for your protection and thanking you for your blessing
Confession is good for the soul, that's how I'm tryna roll
Be one of the greats, see the Pearly Gates now that's the goal
Until then, forgive my sin if that ain't askin too much
Now that's tabernacle, chuuuch!
West side, it's 187 on a motherfucking hook
Got shot in the neck tryin' to get away
And to a vigi it ain't nothin' but gun play
HEEY!
Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin' thug niggas?
Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin' back to brighten up the sky, how many die?
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me - look bitch!
I cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie
Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
Nigga to catch this nigga, I'm ready to peel one
Instead of the shoulders I gotta distort a nigga's grill some
Vigilante and villains and Regime niggas come with steel guns
Get ready to sleep 'cause you tripped when you fucked with a villain
Shady Pacino turned C-ho when I clutched that N9ne
Me and my nigga C-Bo Yuk mezzole not only bust that rhyme
We can do it illegal so the evil'll give a fuck next time
Nigga don't you ever spit my name
And thinking that shit's the same
Two-thou' we switched the game and spit the flame (Wah)
Motherfuck busters like Vell Bakardy yeah nigga had enough ya'll
Nigga, Tech N9ne Killer Klown
Nigga, six feet underground is where you're found
Nigga, 40-Water would never did a song wit you if he knew the song
Was about me never make a million
Next time say my name say my name like Destiny's Children - bitch
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain
Nigga, time to die, say goodbye
So right before you die you bow before a bigger nigga
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep!
Don't fuck with me!
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggas wanna be involved?
But I'll kill all'a y'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Know I meant, every motherfuckin' word
When we ride on our enemies
Buck these niggas, I'm a killer screamin' Regime
Deep navis with heat like the A-Team
And when my K scream, it's causin' nothin' but murder
Bucking these niggas makin' hate me
Yeah, nigga, we don't give a fuck, nigga we thug lords
Connected from Tech N9ne and touched for the thug war
Who got love for these niggas with no love
At all give a fuck guns clutched
'Cause I'm the nigga that cooked the bird (?) in the kitchen
Moms itchin' had the whole gang unwrappin' chickens
Nigga and we was headed for the jack strapped
With a fat gat, all my niggas down to rat-tat-tat-tat
West coast bad boys we was yellin'
Woman – Sir, will you raise your right hand, please? Do you swear and confirm that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth?
2Pac – I do
Police – Could you please state your full name for the record?
2Pac – Yes, 2Pac Amaru Shakur
Police – What is your age and resident address?
2Pac – I just turned 24 on the 16th of June. I live in Decatur, Georgia
Police – How did you get interested in music?
Police – Junior High, High School?
2Pac – Yes, Junior High, High School
2Pac – And poets I saw when I looked on the Webs*, I did that personally, but then I started turning poetry into songs and I got more attention
2Pac – It’s of my opinion that I was rapping while I was writing poetry..
Police – Okay
2Pac – and so I was into rap, I guess you could say from Junior High, when I wrote my first poems. And after I heard on the radio that there were other poets, who were making records and they were selling and it was working, that’s when I decided to change the method of my poetry
Police – How do you define rap? What constitutes rap?
2Pac – That’s what it is to me: poetry. To me it’s story-telling poetry
Police – To music, music with a beat?
2Pac – With or without music you cannot define rap
Police – But it goes, it has sometimes a beat, a tune to it, doesn’t it, even if it hasn’t got accompaniment to it?
2Pac – No, even a pentameter is rap. It’s how you write it, the structure, it depends how you write it, and as to whether it has a beat, I guess it won’t sell as much if you don’t have a beat; the beat is more of a selling tool
Police – Now, you were performing by the time you did your solo-album what people call “gangsta rap”.,
2Pac – No
Police – You were not?
2Pac – No!
2Pac – Rap music!
Police – Have you ever performed gangsta rap?
Police – Okay, and why would you say that?
2Pac – Because, Number One, I do not know what “gangsta rap”, is, number two, I would not classify what my music is as gangsta rap
Police – Have you heard the term?
2Pac – A lot!
Police – Okay
2Pac – I didn’t say that. Where were you at right there? Oh, there. I didn’t say that: that’s not what it says…It says: “I’m a victim for real, everything I talk is for real, I really got my ass beat, I really don’t like …” The interviewer wrote POLICE
Police – Did you mean ””?
2Pac – No
Police – What did you mean?
2Pac – I really don’t like “crooked police”
Police – Okay. So you feel okay about other police?
2Pac – Feel okay?
Police – You like other police?
2Pac – I like everybody that just does their job; I mean it depends on, I don’t know…. Personally, if I meet someone that is kind-hearted*, that’s true and that’s fair, then I like them, especially in a position like that, when a person has to put their life on line*, and they can still be fair to everybody they meet, I definitely like them, and I admire that..
Police – Are you aware of any others who had shot a policeman, especially teenagers who shot policemen after listening..
Lawyer – “after ALLEGEDLY listening”
2Pac – NO
2Pac – But none of them said this until you guys started saying this, they put it all over the news and had Danny Quayle* say it..
Police – I’m asking you, are you aware of any others?
2Pac – No, NO!
Police – When did you first start getting fan-mail? Remember what year?
2Pac – No, I don’t
Police – I hear you said you also received unfavourable mail?
2Pac – Yeah, like this! I got a lot of mail from you’all..
2Pac – No! From “you’all”: YOU guys, the lawyers… lawsuits*
Police – What else, did you receive unfavourable mail?
2Pac – In my whole career I believe I got 5 pieces of hate mail. Of all of the mail I’ve ever gotten, I’ve gotten only about 5 pieces, maximum
2Pac – I responded to your hate mail..
Police – Have you ever used illegal drugs?
2Pac – Marijuana, yes
Police – How often have you used marijuana?
2Pac – In my whole life? At what point in my life?
Police – Let’s say from 17 on ?
Lawyer – I’m going to instruct the witness* not to talk about any use of or possession of illegal substances: I don’t believe that is relevant to this: He’s admitted he used it
Police – I think it’s absolutely relevant. You’re trying to make him out to be a choir boy* and I’m trying to see what he’s really done
Lawyer – I haven’t made him out to be anything
2Pac – You’re trying to make me out to be a devil!
Police – Was it your intention to try to get young black people to be violent to police?
2Pac – No
Police – Were you trying to provoke anybody to do anything particular? Were you trying to provoke or to make people to do things?
2Pac – Yes!
2Pac – Think! Use your head!
Ready nigga? Ready for that raw dog shit nigga?
Ayy, I'm scared to do some freestyle
I'm too high and I might go off-tempo
My game run, 2Pacalypse don't sleep
I keep a motherfucking Glock in my car
If I'm holding in the club, I gotta be the fucking star
'Cause you know how niggas be, they wanna see
If Pac is real or is he like that nigga in the movie
I guess I gotta prove my point
Slicin' motherfuckers, now I'm doing the joint
I got my nigga B-I to the G beside me
Bitches on my dick, you know them hoes wanna ride me
And my other homies out here like Spike Lee
They got the camera on a nigga guess they like me
But now I'm bout to pass this motherfucker on
'Cause this Tanqueray is getting hella strong
Blunt smoke coming out the nose is all a nigga knows
Flippin' on foes, puttin' tags on toes
Watchin' the stash grow, clockin the cash flow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Gettin' paid so much all the bitches wanna see a nigga
I guessed they figured I'm paid I wanna get laid
Or since I got loot I wanna knock boots
Huh, I rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck then we don't fuck
Huh, I rather lick a buck drive a fat ass truck
Grab the nine, two clips and run them up
Yes, flex out the 2 or 3 benz's since I wreck shit
What the fuck you expected?
Puttin' the swellin' on your eye
And your nose even, when I choke ya you stop breathin'
And when police come, I'm leavin'
The Conspiracies
after Tupacs death several deveral people reported they saw him in Jamaica
Suge Knight killed Tupac
In my mind I'ma fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics
Who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling an I am not felling
You fuckers are not ready, cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening
They sendin armies out to bomb me, Constantly armed
The only DJ that can calm me is Constantly armed
My firepower keep me warm I'm Constantly armed
And fuck the world til I'm gone, Constantly armed
They sendin armies out to bomb me, Constantly armed
And fuck the world til I'm gone Bitches be warned
I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me
Follow me tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin to kill me
Picturin pistols, spittin hollow points til they drill me
Keepin it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin steel
Word is bonb, you'll get torn
I'm bustin on Guiliani, he rubbin my niggas wrong
I'm spittin at punk bitches and hustlin to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes
Yeah Nigga!
I like girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans (Baby)
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar
It's instrumental, waiting for the nymphos, that's the intro
Shoot when you rush me
Walked up and touched me
Why do you want to fuck me?
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips, shake your hips
Goddamn, I love that shit!
I got a room and a hard-on. Still down?
Met you standing at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
What's ya phone number?
I like girls
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my
I got a thing for Milano biscotti Italianos
Butter pecan Puerto Rican
Or them oatmeal raisin Asians
Hazelnut Brazilians, macadamia Caucasians
It don't matter, you gettin' it
'Cuz I got a sweet tooth
That'll never come loose
And the fact of the matter is
I like girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar
I'm a monster for these cookies
I'm an animal for they're crackers
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar
Damn. True G. Don't fall asleep nigga, Everybody dies Nigga everybody dies, We all gotta go nigga we all gotta go, Go to sleep nigga, Go to sleep, Close your motherfucking eyes, We all gotta die, Fuck Em All X2, Westside M.O.B
First to bomb, Quick to unload
Expose my foes for being bitches
Keeping niggas suspicious
2 Glocks is filled with ammo
My army fatigues is ready for battle
Tell me nigga how much can you handle?
Banging on wax
Booom!
My intention specifically
Thugged out no sympathy
Pictures of closed caskets
Soon as Daz get with me (I am first to bomb)
First is the calm then the panic
Soon as my niggas break
We earthquake the whole planet
Adversaries can't understand it
The way my niggas strategize
Don't anybody die unless we planted it
Live long committed, I write songs and then spit it
No matter how hard motherfuckers try
They can't get it
It's west coast
Westide, Outlawz till we die, Thug life motherfuckers on the first ride and we are the first to bomb
I got nothing to lose, paying dues
Nigga you wanna die?
I get high, Then my mission is a walk-by
You'd better jet when i hit your set
Cause i am coming, Start running
Yelling Evil-Mind as i am gunning
For the anger that i build inside
For the mothers that cried
The beginning is an ending
Am i just a slave
So i got be brave
So many mothafuckin' people, who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fucking army marching in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days
Who would've thought, standing in this mirror bleaching my hair
With some peroxide, reaching for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keep telling me, I ain't causing nothing but problems
You see I'm making proposals
Full of verbal indecency when ya meeting me
Flash light i am buzzed
What's right like drugs, got 3 strikes
You got cause last night for thugs
Holding my position
My competition is never ready
Ripped by a machete
My alias is Makaveli
So what they tell me through the grapevine
Went for my vocals
Every time a nigga says it rhyme
Spending and busting you thought it up
But you wasn't prepared
Like Kamikazes on a suicide mission
I am spitting multiple gunshots
Burning turning rappers to victims
I kick em all day
(Gunshot sound)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
(Got him)
A smoking-ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a TEC-9 now his smokin' ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
Catch him on the streets, I'mma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin' now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
The first one jumped out and said "Freeze!"
’Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin' like a bitch, cause you don't know how to, hush
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me body
One to the chest, another to his fuckin' dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggas
Crooked ass niggas
(Criminal behaviour-- criminal-- criminal behaviour)
(Suddenly I see--)
(Cri-cri-criminal)
Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick stepping to the niggas with the props
A nigga's tryna play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin' on ten kis, I'mma get him, think I won't?
My nigga 2Pac got the fuckin' Glock cocked and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
Welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh, this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get a-WAY! Niggas got PAID!
And yet another sleepin' ass nigga got slayed, word up
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch
The crooked ass niggas
(Criminal behaviour)
(Criminal-- criminal behaviour)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
Now I could be a crooked nigga too
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin' mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin' piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin' like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggas knew, I'm a crooked nigga too
(Criminal behaviour-- criminal-- criminal behaviour)
Crooked ass niggas come in all shapes and sizes
They wear disguises, backstabbing's what they specialize in
They'll try to get 'cha, they'll sweat 'cha to get in the picture
And then they hit 'cha, son of a bitch! Now he's richer
(Criminal behaviour-- crimi-criminal behaviour)
Crooked ass nigga
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
(Criminal behaviour-- criminal-- criminal
Crimi-crim-criminal behaviour (haviour)-- criminal behaviour
(Criminal behaviour- criminal be- criminal crim--
Crim-criminal behaviour
Criminal behaviour-- criminal behaviour)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
(*machine gun fires)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
(*machine gun fires)
(Got him)
(Suddenly I see, some niggas that I don't like)
(*machine gun fires)
(Got him)
That's right, hehehe
Yo, I heard you got beat up by the police
Got a big fat lawsuit and everything

Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed

And Big Stretch buckin' niggas if they fuck around
Yo why I got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch, the motherfuckers got a beef with me
I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
Instead of them motherfuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then, I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; OOOH!
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too

And we ain't shootin' at each other (fuck no!)
And all the bitches from the Klan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!)
Genuine Draft, ganja ganja, and my fuckin' TEC-9

Blame the Korean.. (fuck that) or be a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin' to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop; see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
You better watch your step or you'll be left on death row
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and OOOH
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth, OOOH!
It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do

One motherfucker from the Underground
And Big Stretch buckin niggas if they fuck around
Yo why I got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch that motherfuckers got a beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin the finger at police
Instead of them motherfuckers blamin me

And when the punk motherfuckers get to trippin I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (hell yeah)
But until then, I gotta do what I do

This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And all the bitches from the Klan
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!)
Genuine Draft, ganja ganja, and my fuckin tec-9
They know they scared to see us sober
Stop drinkin King Cobra, and niggas'll take the world over
It's all up to you (up to you)
Blame the Korean, blame the jew, or be a crooked nigga too
I've got to do, what I'm gon' do
I'm gon' say what I'm gon' say
I'm gon' live how I live - how else you want a nigga to live?
I'm gon' do, what I do
I'm gon' say, what I say
Aiyyo! Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And nuttin but love for each other
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on death row
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin up precincts and OOOH
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too
I've got to do, what I'm gon' do
I'm gon' say what I'm gon' say
I'm gon' live how I live - how else you want a nigga to live?
I'm gon' say, what I say
I'm gon' live how I live - how do you want a nigga to live?
It's the coldest town from here to Georgia
(I'm a crooked nigga too)
(I'm a crooked.. crooked nigga too)
Y'all gon' stop fuckin with me
I've got to do, what I'm gon' do
I'm gon' say what I'm gon' say
I'm gon' live how I live - how else you want a nigga to live?
I'm gon' do, what I do
I'm gon' say, what I say
I'm gon' live how I live - how do you want a nigga to live?
I've got to do, what I'm gon' do
I'm gon' say what I'm gon' say
I'm gon' say, what I say
I'm gon' live how I live - how do you want a nigga to live?
I ran outside 2 feel the rain
and I stayed outside awhile
When the rain was done along came the sun
and this was Cupid's Smile!
Shit, tired of gettin shot at
Tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin hard for better days, promise to hold on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion
I'll see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
If you ever get there
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
For multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
Why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm coming from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream, "Peace," while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquorstore that she's forgiven, so come home
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion
Danger times, danger times, danger times, danger times
Danger times, danger times, danger times, danger times
It's on, a dead body found wrapped in the carpet
No movies no clubs, 'cause you're bound to get caught
In the mix, runnin' for your life, time to get home
See somebody fool caught a straight to the dome
For no reason, death is still the season
People runnin' frantic, 'cause the shots are still ringin'
These damn thugs, just won't stop the gun slingin'
Havin' fun in these days, you gotta wear a vest
1-2-5 in the summer's like the Wild West
Something jump off a nigga cap, everybody cap
Worst about it is every fuckin' body's strapped
All you can do is cross your fingers and hope you're lucky
But if I'm ok when the shots stop, not layin' in blood
Hop in my ride, tryin' to slide with these scared thugs
Everywhere we go the danger's never out of sight
What the hell is goin' on God? Pass the indo
What the hell they killin' over Nintendo?
So you can die later if you don't die today
Mothers cryin', can't understand it
I try to free the hip hop when I rapping lines
But every time I try, it ends up being crime time
Turn on the news, it's like were livin' in a war
No one to trust, the cops are the fuckin' crooks
In these days, they ain't goin' by the books
Proceed with caution, if you're not, you're lost
Get twisted, the last thing on your mind
You got caught kid, livin' in these danger times
It's that reality (dan-danger times...)
It's that reality (dan-danger times...)
It's that reality (dan-danger times...)
It's that reality (dan-danger times...)
Yo I'm ridin' through the back streets
Bumpin' black beats, stop where the niggas sellin' crack be
Say what up to my neighbourhood dealers
Niggas rollin' cee-lo, local car stealers
Narcs cruisin' by, they wanna lock us on the way
But the niggas in the backseat lookin' like a snitch though
Cops hookin' up, lookin' like a little bitch yo
Can't get caught in the mix
By these fake trouble cops and they crooked ass tricks
And uh, hold up yo, niggas rollin' up, for what?
I don't know, but they was busters so I gives a fuck
Pop a man in his fuckin' dome had to yank for chrome
When the smoke cleared, I see my man was dead
And the cops on the corner, then a muthafucka fled the scene
It's gotta be a dream yo I'm buggin'
I stood up the scene, lookin' mean mad muggin' muthafucka
That I be from the streets
For the first thing jump, I got my hand on my heat
It's that reality (dan-danger times...)
It's that reality (dan-danger times...) [nigga, danger times]
It's that reality (dan-danger times...)
It's that reality (dan-danger times...)
Yo, will I, live or die?
I don't know 'cause it's stranger times
I'm too high to read the muthafuckin' danger signs
And you mad 'cause I don't wanna page you, bitch
Now quit being quick to flip
My niggas dyin' over small time triflin' shit
So I ain't got time for these you know whats
On the nuts of a nigga makin' major bucks
New York's finest, comin' right behind us
Mind flippin' off the Moet that a nigga's sippin'
Mob on the scene with the Squad from Queens
Drinkin' Hennessy, muthafuckin' cops are green
Plus the mini 14 for the punks wit' funk
Drop the trunk on them silly bitches, blast them punks
It's that reality (dan-danger times...)
It's that reality (dan-danger times...)
It's that reality (dan-danger times...)
It's that reality (dan-danger times...)
Staring at the world through my rear-view
Go on baby scream to God he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast because it is time to die
Getting high watching time fly
Why will we?
Staring at the world through my rear-view
I can feel your heart beatin' fast because it is time to die
Getting high watching time fly, you know?
Staring at the world through my review
And all my motherfuckers
Staring through my rear-view
Go on baby scream to God he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast because it is time to die
Come on baby follow me lead
Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me then they lie to me
Product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed
Now the little baby's crazed raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
And we turning bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend
I'm seeing nothin' but my dreams coming true
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview
While I'm staring at the world through my rearview
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
And all my motherfuckers
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, counting days in this living black hell
Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Niggas hate me in the section from years of chin-checking
Turn to Smith & Wesson war weapons
I'm getting hotter cause the world's getting colder
Baby, let me hold ya
All you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!
Now I know the answers to the question
“Do dreams come true?”
Still staring at the world through my rearview
I said now I know the answers, “Do dreams come true?”
Staring at the world through my rearview
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Staring at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast cause it's time to die
Getting high, watching time fly
And all my motherfuckers

Born in the the days of a criminal
Runnin' from the cops and can't let 'em see me
So I'm hopin' out the Benz
It's time to let the vallet step
All coppers will get dropped, so tell them not to fuck with me
If Oakland gets too hot, I'm headed for Marin City
I'm black from head to toe, I move and there's a silence
The smoothest criminal, a lunatic for violence
Rippin' of this vest see, so nigga we can handle this
Run up and get smacked up, packed up and smacked down
I'm a playa, there's more in the J town
Bitches wanna jock, and run they hands all in my hair
Ho give up the cock, or you can get up outta here
Niggas gettin' jacked with they cap peeled back
In the days, of a criminal
(Criminal, criminal, criminal)
Born in the days of a Criminal (all in the days of a Criminal)
(all in the days of a Criminal)
I'm kickin' kilos but I start of with a quarter ounce
Servin' with weight cause, every little dollar counts
Makin' my grits and tryin' to get my mail on
So fuck a cop he get dropped if he steps wrong
I'm the bad guy, everybody points at me
But fuck 'em, all, as long as the tweakers happy
Makin' my cash flow, but how long will it last though
Pimpin' ain't easy but I still leavin' your ass broke
Pass the vapors as the papers will be comin' in
I give the cuts and give a fuck about being a friend
Because a bitch will be a bitch no matter what you say
That's why I fuck 'em, bust a nut, and I'm on my way
Soon as I finish I'll be glad I even fucked a whore
But fuck a bitch I keep my mind on my drink cause yo
That's how I'm livin' in the days, of a criminal
(Criminal, criminal, criminal)
It's the menace of Marin
(all in the days of a Criminal)
It's the menace of Marin
(Criminal, criminal, criminal)
It's the menace of Marin
(all in the days of a Criminal)
It's the menace of Marin, I kill, I kill again
Ain't nothing funny about the game the game I'm rollin' in
You got a problem with it, Mr. handle yours
I ain't no joke, I'll have you broke down to your draws
I'm trigga happy and I give less than a fuck
Love me or hate me I'mma show nough rip shit up
It's Mr. nothin', nice on the mic stand
Mic in the left and the zest in my right hand
If that was endo, niggas gettin' rolled up
Cause 2Pac brain locked on the cannabis
Days are dangerous, shoot 'em but you can't miss
Now come and get a good look at the crook, who
Lives his life in the streets of the jungle
Some call me animal, tell me how you figure though
Put 'em in the nimp, in the days of a criminal

Fuck Him, I didn't wanna go to heaven anyway
But my momma got me on my knees with my hands gripped
Talkin' bout some "praise the Lord" shit
Hail Mary, fuck her, I never knew her
I'd probably screw her and dump her body in the sewer
Big, black, and mean, with the fifth by the Gabardine
What you expected from his next of kin, huh?
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
The lesson from the Smith & Wesson is depressin'
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
Follow me, tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin' to kill me
Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points till they drill me
Keepin' it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin' steel
That used to be real, but now they're petrified bitches
I'm bustin' on Giuliani, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do'
With fo'-fo's, hahaha
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
I be that young, pretty fly, smooth, glorious kid
A Bad Boy, just like Notorious B.I.G
With more game than Ron Harper
The bomb sparker rapper slash charm robber
While y'all be on the corners bummy and high
I be out buyin' the finest shit money can buy
You wish you was in a position that I'm in
Every week, bring a different car out
I go to nightclubs and buy the bar out
Uh, 'cause I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
Every time I touch mics, you hear all the freaks scream
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
Yeah, nigga
Thug Life the waterbed, deadly combination boy
It's the heat nigga
Now rewind this motherfucker, you know you can't help it

When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)
Lady, lady
Mama, yeah...
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face

We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama

And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Mama... (Dear Mama)
Dear Mama... (You are appreciated)
Mama, yeah...
Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Mama... (Dear Mama)
Dear Mama... (Just so you know, you are appreciated)
Mama, yeah...
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Dear Mama... (You are appreciated)
Mama, yeah... (Dear Mama)
Dear Mama... (Dear Mama)
Mama...Dear Mama...
You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef

Always was a Black queen

You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin’ to raise a man
There’s no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don’t you know we love ya?

But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?
(Always was a Black queen, mama)
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (Dear Mama)
(Always was a Black queen, mama)
(Always was a Black queen, mama)
Lady (Always was a Black queen)
(Always was a Black queen, mama)
Lady (Always was a Black queen)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys, breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
And who'd think in elementary?
Hey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
You are appreciated
Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you
Oh mama, I appreciate you
Although my shadow's gone
I will never leave you
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
I was lookin for a father he was gone
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you

I will never leave you
Pour out some liquor and I reminisce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama

To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Dear mama
Don't you know I love you?
Dear mama
Place no one above you
(Dear mama)
I will never leave you
I appreciate you
I need you
Oh mama
I love you
Appreciate you
Oh mama
*fading away*

Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone, because you cared for me
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own

Yo, Jackson! (A 231549)
Yeah, close four! Comin' down!
All the penitentiaries
Yeah
One thug, one thug (How do we keep the music playing)
You're listenin to the sounds of one, thuuug
One thug, one thug (How do we get ahead)
Suckers fantasizin pictures of a young brother buried
If daytime is for suckers then tonight we breathe
Out for all that, knowin that this world bring drawbacks
Look how they shiver once I deliver these raw raps
Tonight we, honor the dead, those who won't be back
An Outlaw, thug livin in this game for years
Why worry, hope to God, get me high when I'm buried
Knowin deep inside only a few love me
How I lived for my days as a child; I wonder now
How do we outlast, always get cash
Stay strong if we all mash, hold ya head
How do we keep the music playing (yes, you got to hold ya head)
How do we get ahead.. (hold your head!)
Too many young black brothers are dying (yes, you got to hold ya head)
Hahaha, yo
These felonies be like prophecies beggin me to stop
Cause these lawyers gettin money everytime they knock us
Switched my name to Makaveli, half the rap game ghost
Exposed foes with my hocus pocus flows they froze
Now suckers idolize my, chosen blows
And mo' money mean litigatin, mo' playa hatin
Make them understand me? hell nah, this ain't my posse
Everyone with me is family, cause everybody's got me
Got us all meetin up in prison..
Last week I got a letter from my road dog, written in blood
Hold it
Indeed, enemies bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be the last to my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
I hope for better days, trouble comes naturally
Running from authorities 'til they capture me
And my, aim is to spread mo' smiles than tears
Utilalize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe Mama had it all right, rest yo' head
Straight converstions all night, bless the dead
To the homies that I used to have that no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads..
Plus nobody knows my soul, watchin time pass
Through the glass of my drop-top Rolls, hold ya head!
No matter how hard it get, feel me
Watch the stars, get some pussy, whatever..
Wouldn't be a damn thang without a woman

Child: Why you by the window? What's wrong daddy?
Mother: I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker
He just stand by the goddamn window
With that fuckin' AK all day (there you go)
You don't even do a goddamn thing
I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I see death around the - corner, any day
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I'm thinkin' 'bout my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? - Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of indo and my mind can't take the stress, I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self; but I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
("When we were kids, belonging felt good..")
I see death around the corner
("But having respect, that feels even better..")
I no longer trust my homies - them phonies tried to do me
Smokin' too much weed, got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest, under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived, straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas that was buggin'
They front like they your homies but they phony motherfuckers
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
Got homies in my head that done passed away screamin' "Please!"
Young nigga, make G's
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless, I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner
("When we were kids, belonging felt good..")
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
("But having respect, that feels even better..")
(I was raised) I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kiddy
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household
And drinkin' liquor til' you out cold
And though I'm grown now, nigga it's still on - Pow!
Bustin on them niggas 'til they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta be suspicious when I bone
Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless, them bitches'll start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murder me now but see me later man, that's on my pops
I hope the Lord can forgive me
I was a G and gettin' high was a way of bein' free
I see death around the corner
("When we were kids, belonging felt good..")
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
("When we were kids, belonging felt good..")
("But having respect, that feels even better..")
I see death around the corner
I know you ain't scared to die; we all gotta go, y'know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
(You think you're gonna live long enough to spend that money
You fuckin hump?)
Y'all niggas stop actin' like pussies out there, all right
Are tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like that...
I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night I wanna piss on his ashes!
I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night I wanna piss on his ashes!
I want him dead, I don't care...
And that's why we don't do it, I know what I'm doing, imma destroy 'em
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggas?
Used to love niggas now I plug niggas, and slug niggas
Am I wrong? Niggas makin songs, tryin to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die
Heard the Fugees was tryin to do me - look bitch!
I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie
THEN! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin trick shot
My lyrics runnin all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we RIDE
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
The death of a true thug
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
The death of a true thug
A man of military means in my artillery
Watchin over me through every murder scene
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
You was HEARTLESS on yo' hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me
Nigga you're barely livin, don't you got sickle cell?
How many niggas wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD
Know I meant, EVERY MOTHERFUCKIN WORD
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
The death of a true thug
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
The death of a true thug
Watchin over me through every murder scene
I was their representative, they would never harm me
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
The death of a true thug
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me?
The death of a true thug
A man of military means in my artillery
Watchin' over me through every murder scene
"Nobody's, closing me out of my business"
"Nobody's, closing me out of my business"
My definition of a thug nigga
I played the cards I was given, thank God I'm still livin'
Pack my nine 'til it's time to go to prison
As I'm bailin' down the block that I come from, still gotta pack a gun
Case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb
I guess I live life forever jugglin'
But I'll be hustlin' 'til the early mornin' cause I'm strugglin'
Like drinkin' liquor make the money come quicker
Gettin' pages from my bitch it's time to dick her
That's the way it goes, it's time to shake a ho, make the dough
I keep my finger on the trigger of my Glock
Ridin' down the block lickin' shots at the punk-ass *cops*
The type of shit to get them hoes to bone
My Definition of a Thug Nigga
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"What you doin'?"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"What you doin'?"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season... to be servin'"
Well I roll with a crew of zoo niggas
They're quick to pull a nine when it's time do niggas
Comin' through like I'm two niggas, a true nigga fuck a Zig Zag
Roll me a blunt and pass that brew nigga
I'm drivin' drunk on the freeway, so take it ea-sy
Lookin' for a new face to skeeze me
Everybody's lookin' for a nut but I'm searchin' for the big bucks
Give a fuck, rather die than be stuck
So how's that from the mind of a Thug Nigga
Bought a fo'-five cause I heard that the slug's bigger
Figure the first motherfucker to jump'll find hisself
Gettin' swept off his feet by the pump
I put that on my moms, word to the motherfuckin' trigger
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"What you doin'?"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"What you doin'?"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"What you doin'?"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season... to be servin'"
Short than a motherfucker snatched up by one-time
Make a phone call and be back to ball by lunchtime
So here we go, we in the inner city
Niggas don't like me cause I'm makin' ends
Roll in a Benz and I blaze a blunt, cause I'm all in
And any nigga tryin' to take what I got'll
Hafta deal with the sixteen-shot Glock (huh)
So here we go, I can't be faded
Got my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger
And I ain't takin' shit from no niggas
Put some motherfuckin' food in my tummy right
I'm feelin' good like I'm supposed to, ready to ball
Find a spot and we can serve 'em all

Like this
Blastin', dumpin'
Bitch
I got my pistol cocked and my knife
'Bout to slice this nigga windpipe
Throwin' tops, swervin' me on the dice
Nigga thought he was nice with the slickness
But the nigga I am, sham, just swift with the quickness (Mark ass bitch)
Respect the game, the lame niggas die slow
Hustlers fly straight like Frank feared Scarface
From the Glock, the lead waste
Diggin' out your chest plate up straight
Thinking between and runnin' on my escape
Hop on the 2-10 and wait for you to retaliate
The terrorist doin' on niggas who we {​Glock cocked}​
Glock never miss, through your grill here goes my fist
When I slit yo' wrist
With the the styles of ruckus south central
Los scandalous anybody get buckets uh (West side)
I'm doin' niggas in the rap tussle
Rip out your backbone slow, you go to pieces like a puzzle
I'm hand on muzzles to you whack MC's
Niggas under siege, like Seagal they fall
The loot, the chronic, plus the dips
First nigga that flinches catch a bullet from my hip
In a rage, serving gauge with my Glock to your grill
Let the dump-dumps loose, now your brains is on the ceiling nigga
Murderous mindstate
Can't keep my nine straight
Sippin' on this hennessey
Waitin' for the time to break
Show up and mothafuckas bow down, recognize
West Side, Death Row, outlaw riders
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well known felons labeled for drug sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed
Roll with thugs and dawgs
Who wanna see me solo?
Catch Makaveli while he's sleepin'
My mini-14 murderin' niggas while they creepin', Uhhh!
Duck or you ass out!
Drink 'til you pass out! (what)
Ain't scared to die
Drunk drivin' in my Glasshouse
Niggas is under me
They bitches come to me
They heard the stories nigga
Bomb first, my motto, is fully guaranteed
Niggas is playahatas
Label them my enemies then dumpin'
Look out young nigga!
'Cause it's time to dump
I'm versatile ,mothafuckas
What type of rhyme you want?
Niggas got me in they sight
Now I'm runnin' for my life
Tell me!
What's that, West Side like?
I'm all about the paper chase 'cause the paper makes life so great
Plus, haste makes waste
And I gots the whole spot lock down, concoct styles
Catch me rollin' all the fuck around with the top down (Nigga, what?)
Realest with the microphone
Most murder masher verbal disaster
Creator, 38 stasher
In the inner zone where the hellraiser roam
There is not place like home, TEC-9s and chromes
Got the heater sequence for the heat to the disperse
Just in case worse come worst, I dumps first
The one to dump last is the first to get slumped
My heart skips a beat for the heat sensation
I'm death-defying, bitches lyin' sayin' I ain't cute
Now she wants an autograph (Hey, give me an autograph) Bitch, I ain't Snoop (What?)
One bone bitch ready to go for broke
Hittin' up your marks with my motherfuckin' 4
I'm comin' up about the Hills so feel I'm ready for the static
And niggas on my team is the full flesh automatic
Planting all you hoes in your motherfuckin' place
A bitch named Scarlo is steppin' up in your face
I'm dustin' off you chumps with the .44 slugs
So, nigga, you wanna jump? You gotta jump little higher
Scarlo, nigga, the miss messiah
So bitch you better get a grip on gangs
You fuckin' with the hillside, mentally insane
Believin' in my misery I fucked her in the yeah
Giuseppe called me up and told me so
I gotta do a mission on my ass I gotta go
'Cause you can run, hide (Hide)
But I'm gonna getcha when tryna escape
You know my gat won't letcha run, hide
You know my gat won't letcha
I'm dumpin'
Empty my gun
'Cause here come the cops
I'll be duckin' 'em for blocks
Nigga I'm dumpin'
Empty my clip
Forever bustin'
East Coast nigga rushin'
Mothafucka, I'll be dumpin'
Killer!
Loaded them things, nigga, it's time to dump
Sneakin' on niggas that be sleepin' when they ass in the trunk
You slipped, then got crept on, now it's ride time
To the hills where niggas kill and peel your shit on skyline
It's die time, and can't any niggas save g
Aimin' for heads, pumpin' lead 'til I bury you
Niggas be duckin' but I swingin' low like chariot
Buck buck, now tell your dead homies I said, "What's up?"
Lullaby, rock-a-bye, nigga die
And rest in piece, eternal pain from this fire
My 45 smoked and broke ya
And nothin' hurt like a dick with his liquid, in his eyes wide open
Gats smokin' no jokin', Bullets to me
Deleted soul from his core, as he lay, as I was dumpin'
Jay Z, come out to play
Hey yo Assassin, gimme one of them tracks I can just ride on motherfuckers
Mobb deep.
Niggas talkin' bout we can't rap? Niggas must nota' never heard no motherfuckin'
Track off a death row nigga
Let's get it on, daylight or fuckin' nightbreak
MOB
Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin' Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brandish my strap, back like a cobra
I stay drunk ‘cause I'm a mad man whenever sober
On a one-man mission, my ambition's to hold up
The rap game, while I pluck holes in niggas like donuts
And still down to die for all my soldiers like hillbillies
They don't fear me, so we feud, bringin' war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, Your Honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit, heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question who's sane
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
While bitches wonderin' who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin' slugs like Muammar Gaddafi
We takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga, like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me, another gay rapper
While y'all caught up in the rapture, still after me
I'm in Jamaica sippin' daquiris, no doubt
We used to havin' nothin' then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasn't
I can't tour, fear of catchin' cases, litigation
Niggas player-hatin', got me crooked in all 50 states
We was raised off driveby's. brought up to bang
While I build with this live spot
Live it up or give it up
And like DEMONS. late night. hear 'em screamin'
With money clutchin', bail, come murder man, po's rushin'
Cap tilted to the side, on the lean out the ride bustin'
Outlaws enforce the secrets of war, but won't abuse it
Burnt, bury my burners with my dead buddies when I use it
Give a fuck about later. shots warm through the equator
Old ladies sing the blues. leave them smokin' from they shoes
Now with my every wakin' moment
I'm on a quest to be better, yeah
Position myself to prosper state, prepared for whatever
To gone, off that Novocaine, like in too hard to live it
And I'm just a smidgen past my teenage years. into adulthood
Now I ride with G's finally, knowin' myself good
EDI here take this gun nigga it's over
I piss cold blood, shit hot liquor out my liver
Smoke like a tail pipe, and write when I'm bitter
All my life I been considered a downright, dirty nigga
From when daddy knocked mama' s twat popped the last drop from the litter
Tell me give the world hell
But in hell I give 'em mo'
Screamin' fuck the Po' Po'
When I run to take that enough, from a simple fuck
To multimillion dollar luck
Plus I think it's time to grab all pistols, wave them shits in the air
Celebrate Outlaw livin' nigga, I wouldn't be here
To you death is losin', and to me this shit's a family reunion
My wallet. be as empty as the day I got started
Twelve shots in my pocket, left my niggas departed
It's a shame that these snake vultures niggas coldhearted
In a dirty world where only God know yo death and can call it
We thugged out, low cut, Outlawz rush and royal flush
Bomb first kickin' dust. out in Cali, but I ain't in it so much
Make 'em pay state to state, NJ to CA
Them cowards felt the weight, and turned feminine like Michel'le
Niggas change they whole style when the outlawz comin'
A million miles and thuggin'
Young Noble.I keep 'em buzzin'
While the rapture. capture this fuckin' style that I master
Bringin' terminal disaster. HIT YOU UP when I pass nigga
I TOLD YOU PUNKS THAT I WAS AFTER BIGGIE YOU GOT INVOLVED, NOW WE BOUT TO
US, THE FIRST TO BUST, WHO DO WE TRUST? OUT FOR MOBB DEEP AND JAY Z, DEAD IN

Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha
I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe, cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
To clear my head I’m feelin low, losin’ control
When we conspire to conceive, and now
That’s all I need to hear cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin, I’m a sucka for love
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit and run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry bout it we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

I shoulda seen you was trouble right from the start
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin’ out, just throw it away
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be, you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
(Sucker for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Just when I thought I broke away and I’m feelin’ happy
You try to trap me, say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it
But in this case, what could I do? So now I’m back
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep it goin'
I’m 'bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
To clear my head, I’m feelin' low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh, what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
That’s all I need to hear 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin', I’m a sucka for love

I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

You tried everything, but you don't give up

Hey Snoop

And Lucky Luciano 'bout to sing soprano
And I know, I know the way you feel
Just to get you caught up in amazement
But when it isn't, you can sit izzon bizzack
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha
Outfits unused, fifty dollar socks, hundred-thousand dollar shoes

I mean I steps to tha stage in my G-boy stance
And say a few rhymes to make your girl wanna dance
I'm so fly like a dove
I come from up above
You trippin' on your girl cause she showed me love
Nigga don't beat em, cause if you beat 'em, you don't need 'em
You lay your hands on me, watch how fast I take your freedom
I stay up on em, and that's one ta grow on
You can rock to the rhythm you see
Or you can rock to the rhythm of me
Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everything, is everything
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase
You know I ain't tryna floss, but uh
Murder was the, murder was the case that they lost
I'm Tha DoggFather
C'mon, yeah, c'mon, c'mon
Somebody say "hell yeah"
Hell yeah
Say "hell yeah"
Hell yeah
C'mon, c'mon, yeah, c'mon
C'mon

C'mon
Now, do anybody in the house remember
There wasn't no rappers hollerin' 'bout LBC
Am I trippin' ya'll? (Hell nah!)
Now, when I grow up, I wanna be like Snoop
Have prestigious women
That's the truth from the beginning
You say your family don't know me
Hold on homie, that's for most and promos
No one in my clique fails
But I'mma git back to the grizzind
Snoop D-O double G comin' back for mizzine and
I'm tha DoggFather
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy...
Big Lock!
What The fuck iz up wit ya my Homie!
The fact that not a day passes that I
My record sold 5 Million so I love it like that
I'm Doing a record now called ONE NATION

It'll be out in the late Summer. What Tapez
U need? I'll try 2 get some new material

The faith, Shit gets better Don't even Sweat
The Bitch made Niggas that try 2 Playa Hate
Doggz my real true Niggas "One Love"
Stay Alive! I got that gardener job
Waiting 4 U and the benefitz R rerfect so
When U get here I'm witcha! Let a Nigga
Know what U Need!
THE WORLD IS OURZ
WESTSIDE IV LIFE
Act like
Don't call me bitch, punk niggas and all fakers
Weak muthafuckas ain't nothin' but playa haters
Traitors, and all you ever did was hold me down
Slow me down, but everybody knows me now
So what you do is sit and think of a plot
This shit dropped and it got me hot
Niggas smiled like a bitch, while I gave you props
I should've saw it as a tip off
So I couldn't see the real mission
'Cause you smile in my face, and when I leave straight dissin'
What my partner told me
"Yo Pac watch yo back everybody ain't ya homie"
Should a saw you as a front and fake
An envious snake ready to take my fuckin' plate
I clench my fist and let it end like this
But it dust for a nigga that betrays my trust
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch (call me bitch)
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
You claim to be lady like
You wear your clothes so tight
That you excite the shady type
And at night girl you're the type to get freaky
When I see you in the daytime you're squeaky
Clean, what I mean is ya can't be a fiend for the green
And expect to get treated like a queen
'Cause the brothers on the blocks not havin' it
Now ya fucked around and that ass got fucked)
I came equipped with some shit to get ya tipsy
'Cause a bitch is a bitch
She will use any trick to get me
And last year I used to be a saint
In '92 I'm living heartless
Niggas need to mind they dome
'Cause the time is on for them to find they own
Jock a nigga 'cause he did a major flick
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
It's like a rope, I hung it 'cause I knew I was dope
While others giggled and joked
I watched and took notes
Never surrender, that was my motto as I keep strong
Or dissin', no one would listen, they was dissin'
My record wouldn't sell they said somethin' was missin'
Claiming I was radical, 'cause I was true to the streets
But did the streets been true to me?
How the fuck would I look if I changed?
Actin' strange 'cause I got a little fame
Ain't that a bitch, I was born in a beat down shack
Ain't no turnin' back and now I'm makin' stacks
And ever since the movie
Hoes want to pop that coochie
Every time it suits me
And still I'm the same
I haven't changed my name
Still pledge allegiance to the game
Pledge my life to the ghetto ways
Do whatever it takes to get paid a day
Refuse to lose, never smoke crack
A mack is a nigga wit' the biggest sack
As long as that's your hair I'll take you there
But don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Dedicated to the scandalous hoes out there
Don't call me bitch
I be seeing you at the clubs you know tryin to sue a nigga
And to them punk muthafuckas out there (heh)
Don't call me bitch
But I call you big Pac, nigga you playin' me like one so
Yo don't call me bitch
Yeah, and for them muthafuckas that tryin' to get me to sell out, fuck is on they muthafuckin' mind, shit

Digital Underground, ron keys and the whole motherfuckin' stank
Any of ya know what I mean
Big john motherfuckin' singleton in the house, heartless records in the motherfuckin' house
Watch for a nigga on the big screen and you know what I mean
Watch muthafuckas trip off of this song
But last year he was singing brendas got a baby this year hes sayin' don't call me bitch
Yeah, call me bitch
Some of you niggas are bitches too
Some of you niggas are bitches too
Yeah, don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch

Blackout, blow the track out, my lyrics never fail me
Deliver the bomb shit from the East to West
Like Yayo
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy me, it's fatal
The art of war livin' sucka free, get with me
Nigga just don't sleep
Don't go to sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep
But don't fall asleep
Haha
Now in this life I'm leadin' I've tried succeedin' but I fail
I'm thinkin' I should've listened when the teacher was teachin'
I bounced
Through life with mostly knowledge, that a book can give me
But at school, I played the fooled I probably
Should've took it seriously
Now I'm in a position with a mission that's simple
Get some cash in this rap game, a hustle to get through Uh huh
Me and my dawgs, down like we own the force
Fightin' through the war, shoulder to shoulder, Outlawz
Right on up until they catch us
Forever runnin' from them times that we was broke and
Three dollars for gas and befo' that, then we was walkin'
Haha but peep niggas walk the street
Niggas know the time, so we don't, fall asleep
Come on
Don't fall asleep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep (Don't close yo eyes)
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep (Don't go to sleep)
But don't fall asleep
Sleep baby
Not sleep in the physical form but I mean sleepin' mentally
I mean when niggas close they eyes to the way the game go
Mic check, one two, one two, one two
I flip a double deck and stress ya
Snap on this rap
And cut him from his neck to his rectum
Jersey Jigga another nigga from a drug stomach
Robbin' cradles and robbin' niggas for bitches
Fuck phonics, I cool by the school pumpin' 'notic's
The Madman, I'm tryna let you know 'bout the badland
So now I'm in your town takin' 'em down to the caravan
So when I creep don't sleep
Or watch your floo' catch a slow leak
Don't fall asleep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep

Hands on my semi—automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact 'cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire niggas die wit' open eyes
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks, makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say, we murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the track out, my lyrics never fail me
It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down give him a crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king but he don't do a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room or want the loot he's in it for the sport
Running circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't begging for it
And you can love and you can hate it
But you can't ignore it, you can't be that ig-nor-ant
But you can try to sell him short
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And If I'm fronting man you better come confront me for it
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt
I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh
That's that nigga wit' the fake, blaow!
Why you punch me in my face?
Stay in ya place
Go in this nigga pocket
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Tryin blossom, got shot down walkin, heh
Bleek a high to hot guy, turned cold
Bring the body bag, see the bullet hole and a burned soul
Don't cry, he chose the life
Fast lane, in the brain, he supposed to fight
How you smile at a momma when she lost a child?
I inhale strong weed then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the East to West
Like yay-yo
Nigga's pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy it fatal
Efficiently I delete then flee
The art of war, livin' sucka free, get wit' me
Motherfucker don't sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
But don't fall asleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
But don't fall asleep
Ahhh shit hahaha
My Hummer roll up, evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy, manifestin' military styles
Casual tragedy when niggas battle me
My Prophecized prediction, switch and move positions
My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world me and the mob gettin' married
It seems horrifying screams pierce the dark
Just as suspected, a trick bitch where is your heart
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til it's no one left
Don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Wit' accuracy, they shouldn't talk, bad to me
A nigga that did the murder, so sad to see
Another motherfucker floatin' In plastic reef
Rapid release, keep the police coastin'
Casualties warrant in deep east Oakland (doors wide open)
Drove off to the hills, positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the Lex Ruger, death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullets fly, kill and execute 'em
I blast first 'til they body me
Like my guns in variety
Runnin' wit' the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front
Doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hands on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Poppin' niggas like pimples nigga, nothin' simple 'bout mine
Etch-a-sketchin'
Dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out, ain't no easy way outs for easy exits
Don't sleep
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
We gon' ride, keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine, always hustlin' on the grind
'Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
G's up
A-Town
Blood sweat and tear, when I bust my rhyme
Yeah I un- for my folk like I load my nine
And when I let loose, then no crew standin' but mine
I gives a damn 'bout lame nigga actin' schiesty
Same one knew I was in jail and didn't write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
You might see me wit' a stack in the trap (Aye)
I use my thoughts and pen similar to a saran wrap
A lil' lame nigga I'll never be
Yeah I'ma keep it g I'm from the Three and Scrap will never sleep

Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)

Outlawz
Goddamn! Rap music I hate that
They're cop haters
Here goin' against society, I don't understand the music
It's too loud. It's too loud, it's too rowdy, it's too violent
(Outlawz)
Ban 2Pac, ban the Outlaw Immortalz, ban 'em
Listen it ain't no stoppin' I gotta hustle
Cop it make it double
Try to stop it and touch it
I'ma cock it and bust it
Niggas fuck it I'm tryna get it addicted to fast livin'
Get rich or die tryin' nigga ask 50
I've been Operatin' Under Thug Laws As A Warrior
Oppressed by the industry the Hip-Hop government
Washed around by the Hip-Hop Police
All the judges got grudges
Givin' my niggas life for a little next to nothing
So wherever you are, just a little extra something
You ain't the only one, we all goin' through the struggle
Penny pinchin'
It's like you really ain't livin'
Resultin' on a 211’s, I'm cookin' in the kitchen
Like we lookin' and we wishin'
Prayin' will he hear it?
It's eatin' at my spirit
Speakin' for the spirits
You can't break me, never make me busta soft the beats
Miss Delores Tucker sue me I won't stop
'Til we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies, tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites whistlin' Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'ma make you sorry
Trust me
Tryna sell 4 million copies
If I wasn't spittin' it'd be prison or death
So try to comprehend where we comin' from
Life as an Outlaw, ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
And we can't stop
We can't stop
(Outlawz)
Until we reach the top
I don't know what you've been, told
Real niggas don't stay on they go
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep goin'
Bury me with a Makaveli suit and a MAC
If God strike me with lightnin', I'm shootin' him back
Skinny cause I won't work out, my man is in the gym
Long as I'm strong enough to put a hammer on your chin
Trapped in the storm, fuck the world 'til I'm gone
Until I'm gone
I picture this bricks duckin' from the penitentiary
See
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams
It's all wrong pop too long gone
And now 18 I'm stranded on my own
Protect my throne pow like a king, Al Capone style
Fake no jacks on this grind
Coked up with crack I get mine
Livin' life as a Don, guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton
Yeah your boys back with the proper team
When they think I'm wearin' Red I'ma rock the green
On a whole 'nother episode
The otherside'll hide down the block from the murder scene
When it's hot on Nu he G-Ride from the clear to the bricks
So gangster how he switched from the clear to the bricks
Niggas hate it but they scared of the fifth
(And we won't stop)
Outlawz!
No way no how we got to keep movin'
And puttin' it down
We can't stop
(Outlawz)
Until we reach the top
Through the music we speak to the blocks
Believe it or not
I don't know what you've been, told
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep goin'
Cause it seem somebody hidin' me my nigga
Make a motherfucker cop a Ki'
Motherfucker ain't no stoppin' me my nigga
It's Mussolini see me all in the midst
I'm still chillin' like I'm bottle of Crys'
So when you see me they can give me a kiss
The one posin' with the frozen wrists
Outlaw immortalized we survived and curst
So I claim it like I'm bangin' a turf
Yeah it's easy like I'm puttin' in work
Call me squeezey I'm ready to murk
Outlaw, Makaveli nigga ready to flow
Outlaw my niggas what they screamin' at night
But Big Syko with the thug in your life
My nigga
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Keep goin' (Keep goin')
Even when the wheels fall off we keep rollin' (Keep rollin')
This Hip-Hop thing just won't stop
Here to stay like 'Pac
Man I just can't let it go
It's in my blood stream (Yeah)
So when I flow, I gotta do my thug thing
Young nigga get rich, cash more cheques
Take the hood life
Put it on on wax
Get stakes now we livin' the good life
Car brand new and it shine so clean
Bought momma a house, on sweet sixteen's
From the block to the movie screen deep in and pimpin'
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we won't stop
No way no how we got to keep movin'
And puttin' it down
We can't stop
(Outlawz)
Until we reach the top
Through the music we speak to the blocks

Some of us is trippin' on it (huh)
But in turn busta's slippin' on it
So get up on it, don't be an opponent
Cause this is feedin' my family, take it away
And see me in every single place you plan to be
I got 58 ways to get out of the game
But only one way's gonna fit my name; Hussein
Not even for the cop's will, I close down shop
(You don't really gonna stop, hayy)
Runnin' with fat blunts niggas ain't rollin' right
I bitch this track, I love rap (You don't really gonna stop, haha)
Senseless, relentless in every sentence but above that
Brain driller, fuckin' Fatal's a walkin' pain killer
(You don't really gonna stop, hayy)
Insane iller than caine, Uzi cops, then watch 'em fear ya
I'm ready to check a neck in a second
(You don't really gonna stop, haha)
Gripin' the TEC and slap' ya head because I snap under pressure
Cuttin' circulation
Stranded on the plant the earth's chasin'
Burn like acid
Fart, blunts and Jurassic, Park
My bastard ass click we got the strip mashin'
Don't you stop it (You don't really gonna stop, hayy)
Don't you stop

Stop the music
I ain't got time for this, man I'm out
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
(not that I don't trust you)
As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm goin' crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous, give me space, it won't get better
Where you been and who you wit', I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave, I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
You're suspicious I deceive, gimme grief without belief
Question me about my whereabouts, that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me, and support that's what you're here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go to rest, I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home, so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
Callin' at my house then hangin' up, you think that makes sense?
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
We had a lot of laughs but the good's become the past
Let's make it an even break, don't make it scandalous
You're sayin' I'm too busy, I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I, cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead, you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me?
Instead, I'd rather break, hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but you're lyin'
Fightin' back the urge to just start cryin'
I love you like you love ME, girl, but don't you trust me?
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
(not that I don't trust you)
I hang up the phone, I can't bear to hear you yellin' at me
Maybe we should end it, neither one of us are happy
Comin over cryin' just to get me feelin' guilty
You and me were meant to be and yet
You always wanna sweat, how much closer can we get
Don't fret, just let me pack my things and I'll be outtie
This time I'm breakin' out, you let your mouth overcrowd me
I get no room to sleep, I hope to see some cause I'm leavin'
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya!
And I hope you understand why I'm bustin'
Not because we rushed it
Don't you trust me?
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
Don't you trust me?
It's not that I don't trust you
It's not that I don't trust you
Late night coolin' with my homies
Drinkin' Hennessey and cold brew
After smokin', stopped in Oakland
So we stopped to get a bite to eat
At the local barbecue
It's just another boring Monday
And there's nothing else to do
Now as we stepped out of the car
I heard someone behind me fighting
So I turn to look and find out
And the other was a dopeman
And the dope man had an AK
Said he'll spray and he's not jokin'
Well it seems to be the dopefiend
Owed the dope man for his product
And he swore if he did not pay
He would end up getting shot up
Now I could not walk away
Wondering what would happen to this
Well my homie, Michael Cooley
Said let's go and make our order
What's the use in watchin' two men
Stand out here fight over quarters
While I walked inside the diner
And all the Dope Fiends waved to me
Heard the sound of several gun shots
All the people in the diner
Ran outside to see the big show
It was just another party
But for me I held concern
I wanted to go see the outcome
Would the mother have her son tonight
Or would she live her life without one?
I made it to the streets I
Not only had the fiend died
But a small girl had been shot
That was daddy's bullet
But she took it in his place
I tried to make my way through the crowd
So I could go help the baby
She could barely speak
Mister can you please save me
Oh how I hated everyone there
The baby lie here dying
And I wondered what could I do
The camera men and newspapers had come
To them it's just a story
To them it doesn't matter
I don't think I'll be back
Cause it'll never be the same here
So I wipe away the tears
Though some people say it's crazy
And the food could have been finer
I'll never forget, never forget the night
At Dopefiend's Diner
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do...
After smokin', stopped in Oakland
Got the munchies for some soul food
So we stopped to get a bite to eat
It's just another boring Monday
Now as we stepped out of the car
I heard someone behind me fighting
So I turn to look and find out
What's the cause of this excitement
One brother was a dopefiend
And the other was a dopeman
And the dope man had an AK
Well it seems to be the dopefiend
Owed the dope man for his product
And he swore if he did not pay
He would end up getting shot up
Wondering what would happen to this
Well my homie, Michael Cooley
Said let's go and make our order
What's the use in watchin' two men
Stand out here fight over quarters
While I walked inside the diner
And all the Dope Fiends waved to me
Heard the sound of several gun shots
And I ran outside to see...
Another siren screams
Another mother cries
(What's goin' on)
'Cause another innocent dies
(What' goin' on)
All the people in the diner
It was just another party
For them to see just who they would know
But for me I held concern
I wanted to go see the outcome
Would the mother have her son tonight
Or would she live her life without one?
I made it to the streets I
Almost cried right on the spot
Not only had the fiend died
But a small girl had been shot
I felt a tear roll down my face
That was daddy's bullet
(What's goin' on)
Another gunshot rings
(What's goin' on)
Another siren screams
(What's goin' on)
Another mother cries
(What's goin' on)
'Cause another innocent dies
(What' goin' on)
So I could go help the baby
She could barely speak
Mister can you please save me
So I screamed out, someone help me
But I dont think they could hear
Oh how I hated everyone there
The baby lie here dying
And I wondered what could I do
To them it's just a story
And they can't see the tragedy
To them it doesn't matter
Cause it ain't, it wasn't their family
I don't think I'll be back
So I wipe away the tears
And leave the scene the way I came here
And the food could have been finer
I'll never forget, never forget the night
(What's goin' on)
Another gunshot rings
(What's goin' on)
Another siren screams
(What's goin' on)
Another mother cries
(What's goin' on)
(What' goin' on)
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do...
Respect to the Death Row Inmates
Death Row Inmates lawd dem never hesitate
To bust a gun shot, in a idiot face
Dis is Dogg Pound and your life goes to waste
Dat Nigga Daz put you inna di cemetery
Now the D.P.'s, if ya down with this shit say "hell yeah"
Hit a corner, hit a switch, say "hell yeah"
Fuck a hoe, fuck a bitch, say "hell yeah"
To all my G's that slang, say "hell yeah"
To all my bangers that bang, say "hell yeah"
No matter where the fuck ya hang, say "hell yeah"
Yeah, check it out
Now here's the perfect mix to let it bubble and foam
It's the mischevious, lyrical genius on the loose
And I pack the deuce-deuce of some act-right juice
I'm in my own, space and time
The elevation of my rhymes elevates your mind
For a G from DPG to wear clear blue and gray
I come, I came, I am, I ain't
The nigga ya wants to fuck with, get peeled like paint
Bottoms up, nigga, give it all ya got
From the bottom to the top or get shanked, get shot
From this infectious enemy, they on a loose (What)
My motherfuckin' nigga from back in the past
Now imagine yourself in a bottomless pit
With no way your climbin' out, and this ain't the punishment
Deadly as crystal crack, how should I react
With intentions to keep on mashin', strap to strap
Is this my boundary from county to county?
Your homies wanna try to soak me like Bounty?
Dogg Poung Gangsta all day, all night
Partying like a motherfuckin' now all night
But uhh, simple as fact I been wanting to serve your whole fucking crew
Load up your weapon slowly step in caught your homey straight slippin'
You shoulda known from the jump nigga that I was trippin'
Dogg Pound Gangsta gets to dippin' in the cut
My performance is enormous the way that I stayed up on em
I catch em and let em have it what's up, with my opponents
I hold it down for the two and I'll be gunned down by no one
Forever I reign, top Dogg number one
My rhyme to some explainable and Doggs that's untrainable
I'm a D.P.G.C. for life
I do what I feel and, I do what I like (C'mon)
I'm a D.P.G.C. for life
I do what I feel and, I do what I like (Sing it)
I do what I feel and, I do what I like (Fuck that)
I do what I feel and, I do what I like
I hits it like shots, from the homey strap
Give a FUCK whatcha name is, I tell ya quick
Out of mind, something I wouldn't do without a nine
I got a pocket full of papers and a trunk full of beat
Mashing all through the streets rollin wit some heat
I'm heated, repeat it, day after day
Daily survival tactics in L.A
I'm on point and alert
Lurked, I puts in work like a chemist
Mentally known to cause motherfucking dilemmas
It's a Dogg Pound Gangsta on the loose out there
Yeah, it's your shit, say "hell yeah"
Dogg Pound gangstas say "hell yeah"
When I roll throughout your block say "hell yeah"
For all my niggas that gang say "hell yeah"
If you looked outside and the homies came through
Would you ride? (I ride) Would you ride (I ride)
Or would you think or by chance the circumstances of a mark
And get your ass whooped in the middle of a park?
Would you ride? (I ride) Would you ride (I ride)
Ya don't doubt that Snoop
Don't doubt that Snoop

Who you are
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this
Murderous mind state, can't keep my 9 straight
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waitin' for the time to break
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw ridaz
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well-known felons, labelled for drug-sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed, roll with thugs and dogs
Commence to lettin' off rounds then escape in the fog
My Mini-14 murderin' niggas while they creepin'
Niggas is under me, they bitches come to me
They heard the stories, nigga, now they wanna really see
"Bomb first" my motto, it's fully guaranteed
Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this
When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get
Out the window on some "Uptown Anthem" shit
I'm stressin', but ain't no pressure here, I been here before
Fugitive, task force at my girlfriend door
Now they checkin' in her bedroom, I ain't there
.40 cal's, extended clips, still I ain't scared
Outlaw and best believe they won't take me alive
I'm different and I'ma prove it if it take me to die
But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me
Me dyin'—you think I'd let them see the joy from that shit?
Walkin' dead, angels spend they last days by me
New Jersey giant like Dave Tyree
Young George and Jonathan Jatt
Your guns clap, mine'll go brraaatt, soldier like Geronimo Pratt
And come through cockin' the black pound
When they put the Twin Towers up, Pac, I'm knockin' them back down
Poster child—cheque!
Air Force Ones with the crocodile checks, I'm supposed to wild sex
Money and murder is all I breathe in my life
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
Through the Henny I see the eyes of the Devil
G ridin' with extra boxes of bullets to the 9 and the shovel
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
You end up in a box ‘cause them graverobbin' bastards
Dig your grave back up, snatch you out the casket
Worms in my eyes, eatin' through my cabbage
The flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session
That's why I keep pressure on 'em like a open wound
This God-given, he keep givin' me better music
So every time you hear me my songs present improvement
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin', songs are evolution
If I load your gun for you when we bang it out with some other niggas, you better shoot it
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless
You got the same bullets that you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it
The Nacirema dream get ready for execution
Papoose, Fatal and Pac—the revolution
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
I remember when u were LOST
and your soul was in the wind
But then your soul was found
and u discovered celibacy
But with this u forgot about me
And now I c u felt it
the bond we made before
I pray 2 God it stands
and severs never more
Young Thugs in this motherfucker
Don't break up the fight, let 'em rumble
Don't make enemies with me

Don't make enemies with me
Some say my criminal experience is legendary
I do what's necessary
Niggas wanna see me buried
I ain't goin' down, fuck the world I'm a thug
Tell 'em can't nothin' stop me but a slug
I went from drug dealin' to a shot caller
From off the block, no longer rock
And puttin' money in my pocket, nationwide baller
Bitch nigga I'm prepared to die, Before I fry
I hit the weed so I be forever high
My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
Bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thuggin'
And fuck the law 'cause the raw niggas ain't free
This picture's clear but we can't see, hahaha
This game is jealousy, Don't let 'em change
That's what they keep on tellin' me, motherfuck the fame

I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Don't make enemies with me
The game is gettin' deeper with this I couldn't stop, I'm reminiscin'
And havin' flashbacks when them niggas came up missin'
Wish in my heart, these niggas they ain't have to start
Now therefore they gotta see in dark
Played the part with heart when we spark they part
Runnin' silly through the court, they don't really wanna start
How you wanna do?, yo K, anyway
So I stay, sippin' on my aray to keep my head fine
And I'm where, Everywhere from here to bedtime (yeah nigga)
And I squeeze when I say I'm comin'
Straight gunnin' on enemies if it's really me that they wantin'

You rather fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me

A nigga struggle too hard for what I got
Hustle And doubled every fuckin' yard that I cop and stop
Hell nah! I couldn't see it
Facin' a century in the Penitentiary but so be it
And Jesus couldn't help me out the state
Prepare for an early date to see my fate at the pearly gate
But wait No time for stallin' But death is callin'
You wanna stomp on it somebody's gotta start fallin'
True, what I do from sun up is for a come up
Wake up with my gun up 'Cause when I sneak that's when they run up
So It's time to spray like Ray
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see

Do.. you know, live the best life I can live
Be as happy as I can be.. nothing is perfect for anybody

To every dark night, there's a bright day after that
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad, especially come the first and the fifteenth
So no matter how hard it get, stick you chest out, keep your head up..
Hold on..
I'll catch y'all up in the next life
Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to 'em bet
I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by
And driveby's robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
Pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin' me down
And facing me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on
There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin' getting high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm tryin' to tell you when it's on
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on
When it's on it's on but wipe your eyes
In this world only the strong survive y'know
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
Welfare, AIDS, earthquakes, muggings, carjackings
Yeah we got problems but believe me when I tell you
Things always get better God don't like ugly
And God don't like no quitters
You know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee
God bless the child that can hold his own
Y'know? You got to stand strong
The game don't stop, Hmmm
If you don't never leave nothin', learn one thing
Hold on
Actually talk to the motherfuckers that persevered (hehehe)
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
(Hey, excuse me, excuse me) Y'know? (Look)
We back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
'Cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin' what you thinkin' but you must abandon ship
'Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin'
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin' that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
Listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin' back, for everything you owe
I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
Yes sir, how do you plead?
Shit, you know how I plead
Psssh
Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin' for ki's
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed "Nigga motherfucker"
Dropped me to my knees, I proceed to bleed
Sufferin' a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin'?
I grab his gat and bust in self-defense, my only option
God damn!
Now they got me goin' to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me, and my people, to a mansion in Brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, repossessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self-defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin' this in federal prison, givin' everything I owe
I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
I couldn't help but notice your pain
It runs deep
Share it with me!
They'll never take me alive
I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kickin' up dust
But now I'm labelled as a trouble maker who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
I'm about to crash up on the curb, cause my visions blurry
What should I do?
What else could I do?
But be a thug
Out slangin' with the homies
Never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang bangers and drive-bys
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young
But still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse
Mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin' back to court
So fuck what you thought
Will I live to be 23?
There's so much pain
Everywhere I go
I see the darkness
Covering skys
Everywhere I go
Everywhere I go
Trouble seems to find me
Everywhere I go
What would you do, if you couldn't make it to the NBA?
What would you do, if you couldn't sing, like a Mary J?
What would you do, if you couldn't hit a white ball, like Tyga?
If you wanted to model, but you wasn't skinny like Tyra?
What if you wanted to be Eminem
You can be Eminem, and I got proof
Or you could be Obama, and bring back troops
Or you could be Osama, and tear off roofs
Or be Corporate America, and reject all youth
Or be the sole, inside my shoe
So you can see where I walk, you can see where I been
See my father raping my sister when she was just ten
9, 8, 7, 6, NASA take me away, life's a bitch
Everywhere I go
Trouble seems to find me
Blood in my eyes
Everywhere I go
They got me mobbin' like I'm
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
Bust on motherfuckers with a - paaassion
I'm a nuttin, drinkin' Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die
Tell me why cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck-fifty across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
These sorry bastards
Want to kill me in my sleep but will they can I see
And everyday it's just a struggle
Don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
I was born to raise hell
A nigga from the gutta
Word to mutha I'm tough
I'm kickin dust up
Ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean
Until they kill me
I'll be livin this life
I know you feel me
There's so much pain
Davey D: His mother, Afeni Shakur, was a member of the Black Panther Party.  She was pregnant with Tupac while in jail and on trial as one of the Infamous New York 21. This was a time where all the members of the party were accused of conspiracy to bomb public places. Afeni Shakur was eventually acquitted of all charges. Tupac's aunt Assata Shakur was also a member of the Black Panther Party. She was accused of killing a New Jersey state trooper. She eventually fled the country in exile. Today she still lives in Cuba. Tupac described his mom as a strong-willed woman who handled her business. His real father was unknown. As a youth, he identified with a pimp and petty hustler named "Legs" who later died from a crack-induced heart attack. Tupac was described as an energetic child who always liked to imagine himself in the lead role. His mom saw fit to enroll him at age 12 in the 127 Street Ensemble, which was a theatre group in Harlem, New York. Tupac’s first acting role was the character, Travis, in the play Raisin in the Sun. Tupac did not involve himself with rap until he and his family moved to Baltimore. As a young teenager, he took on the name "MC New York." While living in Baltimore, Tupac continued his acting by auditioning and later being accepted in Baltimore's Prestigious School for the Arts. At age 17, Tupac moved with his mom to Marin City in the San Francisco Bay area. It was in Marin City that Tupac lived about street life. In an attempt to be accepted and fit in with his peers, Tupac became a petty hustler who sold drugs. It was in Marin City that Tupac rediscovered rap. He ingratiated himself in the Bay Area's emerging rap scene by joining a group called Strictly Dope. This group featured fellow Bay Area rap star Ray Luv. While a member of Strictly Dope, Tupac decided to branch out and he eventually became friends with Digital Underground’s lead rapper, Shock G. Tupac auditioned for the group and he eventually became part of the group first as a roadie and later as a dancer. He went on to be a hype man for the group Digital Underground. As a member of Digital Underground, Tupac became known as "the rebel of the underground." Much of this had to do with his excitable and unpredictable personality. Tupac's tendency to stir up things had lead to many of his successes, as well as many of his troubles.

He who writes for Billboard Charts
Okay, now let's take a look, what do we got now?
To the second looks, the crooks gon' prop now
All these mean muggin' brothers from the streets
Have turned into tender lovin' rubbin' club beats
And even if it is, better fakin' I ain't wit' it
No funky footsteps here, so don't even ask me
That's why dancers on the payroll gettin' paid
But ain't no dancers in the studio when the record's made
It's just me and Big D goin' buckwild, on top of the pile
So come come make you done if you feel it wrong
Lay low and lean but sleep and I'ma pull ya cards
2Pacalypse is rockin' it for the public
So what you wanna do now? You and your crew are through now
Think the ice is meltin', 'cause brothers are comin' true now
Hip-hop's here to stay, they fade away
He who writes for Billboard Charts
But kicks no material from inside the heart
They fade away, fade away
Hook in like a crook, I stepped up and took your mic
And when there's not a single instrument playin'
And ain't nobody prayin', I can't hear a word that you sayin'
Heard you sold a million records in a million states
And the Tipper Gore don't impress me
She's a threat on a quest to undress me
Sometimes I jest, I don't vest, so don't test me
This ain't no bus, so don't rush or arrest me
Making money and rippin' angels is beautiful world we're living in
Looking at the Grammy nominations, smilin' in my face and
Waitin' to take my place at the pace of a corporation
This is just a taste of the aggravation, frustration
Having a faith in your occupation
Cops think I'm selling a basin, I'm selling tapes and
Tryna take my race to the better place and
Peace to the brothers that paved the way
Rollin' over in they grave today while they fade away
He who writes for Billboard Charts
But kicks no material from inside the heart
They fade away, fade away
He who writes for Billboard Charts
But kicks no material from inside the heart
They fade away, fade away
Fade away
Fade away
Away an AK
Never fade away
Never fade away
Never fade, never fade, never never fade away
But kicks no material from inside the heart
So fade away, fade away
There were 2 people with one wish
2 GOD they would pray that 2gether they'd stay
under the stars above
But someone else made a wish
at the same time on the same breath
And although the wish 4 love was granted
So was this evil wish 4 Death
Now I make a wish
sealed with tears and laughter
It is my wish that these 2 loves
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
Truly, you're a cutie
You know I ain't tryin' to act a fool
And be rude, they call me Kastro
And you; Oh! Storm sound like a cutie too
What's poppin'? with me and you
Just hit me with the seven
It'll be my pleasure to see what we can do
Oh! you ain't alone, got a man at home, answerin' the phone
What you drinkin' on? - Hennessy with me
A glass of Thug Passion or just a plain Pepsi
Oh! you're cool? - sure that I assume
You ain't too much of a drinker today
You was alright, I think I want you right away
See, I'm only eighteen, these groupies they just want to sue me
Push my whoopty, act like they don't spend my dooky
And I could see it'd be
I put you in my video, and give you plenty of dough
By my hotel room, Four fifty four, hope that you go
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
See girl, I'm laced with game but it ain't similar
The shit that I'm talkin' get more deeper
Than callin' and comin' to visit ya, it's hard to feel ya
But I been playin' since I been born
Can't ignore, the way you hit the club and play the floor
Hittin' up every position and that's for sure
But I think it's more, than situation that I'm facin'
Your Shorty was hesitation so I'ma replace her
Plus to get specific; it ain't no hoochie that's unlisted
That the homies that I roll with ain't twisted
And that what makes me diss it
For droppin' the highest level of game and got no digits
Now can you dig it? - but you ain't in no competition
Now, baby can you fade me?
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
Oh! Mo, you're a little player Napoleon but uhh
(Let me show y'all little niggas how it really goes)
I'ma show you how the big dogs do it nigga
This is how you get her up
You don't know how to rule no bitch nigga
(Hold up baby! would you get off, thinkin' you can fade me)
Get to the side, which one?
Pick all out, pick out nigga, which one?
That one? - peep this shit
Hold up baby, would you get off, thinkin' you can fade me?
Oh! yeah, you're crazy thinkin' you can just be Swazy
Participation is needed, yeah, I'm drunk and gettin' weeded
In the back of my Jaguar, the life of a rap star
Completely freak-able
I get weak, when I sit and think of shit that we can do
Let me introduce Mr. Makaveli is who you're speakin' to
What's up with you? - as you can see I love freakin' you (Boo)
Who, Black, Mexican, Puerto Rican too
Long as it's ghetto you can bet I'm gettin' deep in you
Believe it boo, I got my eyes concentrated on the size of your thighs
No I ain't Dre baby, but won't you let me ride?
'Cause a nigga want the putty cat
And that's a fact, so, how you want to act?
Baby, can you feel me? - like Run D.M.C. "It's Like That"
Tell me, can you fade me?
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me
That's how you mack to a bitch you little young niggas
Come on baby, we finna go to my little hotel and shit
Ha ha, to see if you can fade me, feel me?
Hey, don't trip of the 'B' word
That's just how motherfuckers talk on my block
Ha ha, What's up though boo? where you want to go?
No we can go get a little drama and shit
Don P., Crystal, Fat ass steak, some lobster and shit
Go back to the telly
Bump some of that Dramacydal Outlaw Immortal shit
That's the type of shit that get me in the mood, you know what I mean?
Ha ha, come and tell you now and uhh
Nigga, this beat's bad than a motherfucker
You know, ain't no disrespect big player
But a motherfucker loves this beat so much
We're sendin' this one out to you
OUTLAW!! WEST SIDE!! DEATH ROW!! THUG LIFE!!
OUTLAW!! WEST SIDE!! DEATH ROW!! THUG LIFE!!
OUTLAW!! WEST SIDE!! DEATH ROW!! THUG LIFE!!

This, is a Jazze Phizzile produc-shizzle (Jazze Pha, Jazze Pha)
My nizzle! (My nizzle) Ha!
Outlawz! (Outlawz) 2Pac, Makaveli!
Still breathin', yeah, woo - wooo-WHEEE!
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushin', pullin' and twistin' I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did
Steady yellin' out spots for me to hit, and "aw shit"
Soon as I seen her saw us playin' hide the weiner
Wanna "Freak Like Me", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, "Can I cum inside?"
Say you don't feel it that's a lie
You just scared to get this penitentiary dick
The trot caught your eye when I walked by
I said, "Hi"
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
Got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me (give it to me give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang
Open your legs
Got me marchin' like it’s a million, you tremble from the feelin'
Look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceilin'
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
'Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it 'cause you walk around actin' like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin' me no favors, fair exchange
You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)
A fair exchange, on everythang
And Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Give it up to me (give it to me, give it to me)
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang
Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
And since you bein' laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
In bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin'
You said "take it" so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange
You do me
And if it's worth it baby, I'll return the favor
And give it back to you (give it to you, give it to you)

Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me (give it to me, give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game

You want me to do what?
What is it?
Fair exchange, fair exchange ain't no robbery (I do you, you do me hahaha)
Fair exchange, fair exchange ain't no robbery (Everything's legal, baby, everything's legal)
A picture of perfection
The object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Steady, yellin' out spots for me to hit, and "aw shit"
Soon as I seen her, saw us playin' hide the weiner
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holler out my name when a thug nigga ride, "Can I cum inside?"
Say you don't feel it, that's a lie
You just scared to get this penitentiary dick
The trot caught your eye when I walked by, I said "Hi"
But you were so shy, I can't lie, damn-near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it, and even worse
Got your heart set on me going first, and that ain't no fair exchange!
Fair exchange
Ain't no robbery (hahhaah, yeah nigga)
Fair exchange
Open your legs
Got me marchin' like it's a million, you tremble from the feelin'
Look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceilin'
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw your legs out the window
Remember on the balcony? Bend over baby, bounce on me
Remember me? "I Get Around," and I'm haunted by my "Temptations"
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it 'cause you walk around actin' like you're perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Fair exchange
Fair exchange
Now your attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true, I'm gettin' pussy, but baby you're gettin' dick
And since you're bein' laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait until you asleep and that's the payback
'Cause you're actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange

You can do whatever you want, I got what I want and gone
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Open your legs
Got me marchin' like it's a million, you tremble from the feelin'
Look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceilin'
And if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
'Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? "I Get Around," and I'm haunted by my "Temptations"
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it 'cause you walk around actin' like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin' me no favors
Fair exchange
Only one thing that you, can do, for me
Baby you can treat me right, we can do it all the night
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make, me scream, your name
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm gettin' pussy, but baby you gettin' dick!
Instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
In bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin'
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
'Cause you actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange
(It's only one!!!) Only one thing that you, can do (thing that you can do for me), for me
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make, me scream, your name (make me scream baby)
You can get whatever you want, I got what I want and gone
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Only one thing that you  (whatever you want), can do, for me
Baby you can treat me right (can you do me), we can do it all the night
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make, me scream, your name
You can get whatever you want, I got what I want and gone
Nothin' more than our fair exchange
Fair exchange

Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what
Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what (yeah)
Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what (yeah, what, yeah, uh)
Pack your cannons we outlandishly brandish the weapons
Meet Jamaican like you god {U-god?} and 'em handing you lessons
And get to speakin' on a conditions of black people
That's illegal they enforce it with the force that's lethal
Head to congress exercising your constitutional right to bear arms
Leather jackets and glasses and you can tell it's us
The FBI probably bust a nut if we self destruct
Call it militant but ain't nobody killing Barry {Goldwater}
You can't be militant if you ain't got no military
Picture some niggas with guns, got 'em very disturbed, word
Now-a-days you could get shot for a cheap necklace
Back then my people bust shots for the free breakfast
Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
You could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky
Everybody act hard, like they got no regard
So we mourn falling stars, they still living all hard
(We still here, word)
This is for Medgar Evers, Martin, and my brother Malcom
Sometimes we be sittin and wishing for another outcome
My head be spinning, it be full of why's and the how come's
The value of life is so cheap if your skin ain't talcum
It's about the cash, so we respect the biggest gainers
Don't be confusing me with haters, player
Get your paper, just show respect to the folks who made you (yeah)
Blessed by the creator so give money nigga
Just don't bring a plate of food around a hungry nigga
Out on these streets the police is killing
I'm spilling out my heart on these beats so I can feed my children (yeah)
Because we don't need no more fallen stars
Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
Everybody act hard, like they got no regard
So we mourn falling stars, they still living all hard (We still here)
Hands off Asada and the blood of a dance floor
Word, rock on, throw the 2Pac on
Shine brighter than those Vegas lights
Illuminating that Vegas night to the party after the fight
'til the gunshots disturb the peace like Luda
Too bad he ain't a white chick in Aruba
They'd have a whole department dedicated to finding the killer
Word, Bill O'Reilly would be flapping his gums
How much respect do they have for my people?
Actually none
You either do the nigga packing a gun who hate niggas
Even though every time he pass a mirror he staring at one
My man stressed cause of lack of funds
This the type of shit that make you wanna drown your liver
And blacken your lungs
Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
You could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky
Everybody act hard, like they got no regard
Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
You could learn from the stars that fall outta the sky
Everybody act hard, like they got no regard
So we mourn falling stars, they still living all hard (We still here)
Eazy-E, still here (still here)
My man Justo (still here)
Big L (still here)
Big Pun (still here)
I'm from Brooklyn, you know what I'm saying
Brooklyn know a lot about tragedy
That was our whole world, yo (still here)
This is for our fallen stars
Inspired by the poets, revolutionaries, and activists
From the generation before us
Come and do our thing on this microphone
Can a black man get on the microphone
And say whatever the hell he wanna say?
It's a lot of responsibility
But we standing on the shoulders of our ancestors
So I bear that burden, throw it on my back
They could never understand
what u set out 2 do
instead they chose 2
ridicule u
when u got weak
They loved the sight
of your dimming
How could they understand what was so intricate
they wanted 2 c your lifeless corpse
This way u could not alter the course
of ignorance that they have set
2 make my people forget
what they have done for much 2 long
2 just forget and carry on
I had loved u forever because of who u R
And now I mourn our fallen star
We want the fame!
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
The one thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
It's been nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
Though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to G's
Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
They got me hot when they shot me, plotted my revenge
To increase my ends, enemies gettin' dropped
Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true
Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
And for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame
What's to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?
Somewhat insane, I'm hopin' we can change with time
I know, death follows me, but I'll murder him first
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask
I'm the first one to want him blasted
Wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit
Ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fake in fame
Block run and shoot slugs
We throw them back like hardballs
Without the gloves, no love for these fake desperadoes
And thugs I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts, sippin' Henny
Drunk nights, and hot days
Cockin' my heat, shootin' it sideways
A life on the run, full of common blunts
Fulfillin' my destiny on knees and one's desires
Be pullin' all my cabbage like priors, stuck in the trance
Searchin' for something higher, the fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Something we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Searchin' for fortune and fame
Searchin' for fortune and fame, lost in the rain
A lost of the game, with life is the cost of the game
We forcin' the change, motherfuck flossin' a chain
All the blame belongs to the part of the brain
That we never use, nigga, plus my heart is in pain
And if I ever lose, homie, bet I'm at it again
Outlaws don't die, so united we stand
And if family come before, all the fortune and fame
As I walk up in the crib, laid to rest my head
Say salaam to the angels, hope they bless my bed
Hope they bless me the righteous way
Got a homie locked down outta town, I sent him a kite today
Man, that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it, dawg
Prayin' for my downfall, and I can sense it, dawg
I was passed down the street fame
Like Glocks clocked and keep aim
And I ran with the local street gang
They say the light is faded but still shine in the dark
And that's some game that I got from generation of game
In the road of life, dog
We need to switch up lanes – think about it!
One thing we all adore
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Been nothin' but pain
Searchin' for fortune and fame
I can't complain, I've seen my fair share of the fame
It won't change me, now I've got this piece of change
I feel strange, I got so used to the hood
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good
I was just a baby, still retarded from slavery
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me
Ghetto ain't made me, I made myself
Poverty raised me, thinking ain't no help
I pray for my health, my mind, and my family too
State of myself, my grind, and my family crew
Where one hand washes the other
No, we ain't blood, but we still real brothers
The struggle is real, nothin' can steal what we build
And that's real, life that I was aimed to be
Love by my family tree, that's fame to me – how about it?
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Stuck in this game
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
Because we all spring from different trees
It blossoms in darkness, and gives birth to promising pods
I was that tree that grew from the weeds and wasn't meant to be
Ashamed I'm not, in fact I am proud, of my thriving - family - tree
Though I.. struggle in my life, I never give up
And you.. know that I, will always be by your side
My family tree.. yeah a family tree
Yeah, my family tree.. my fam-i-ly tree
I find, greatness in the tree that grows against all odds
You'll never see me give up
I will press on.. never hold my head alone
Never no.. my family tree.. my family tree yeahhh
My family treeeee.. family treeeee..
Because we all spring from different trees
Or in the vast forest in which it breathes?
The tree must fight to breathe
Ashamed I'm not, in fact I am proud, of my thriving - family - tree
Haha, aight
Storm, motherfuckers
Ain't really knowin' if you can flow or not
So, do this shit like last time
Holler my name, nigga, you ridin' to scream
Must be a thug with a heart to be a part of my team
It seems we got a problem
We ain't lettin' no women and the feminine side
Now who the dopest?
I agree, it's a man's world, but why must niggas diss us
I ain't tryin' to hear it, witness my thug spirit
'Cause niggas love to hear it
Called on my dawgs, 'cause they rowdy then a motherfucker
I love you niggas like brothers, but don't fuck with me
So all you niggas be warned
From the dusk til the dawn
We Outlawz
I said it and meant it
And when you see me live on TV
Now, let me hear you scream
This is for my niggas
Only for my niggas
For my niggas
Let me see you throw your hands up
This is for my sistas
Only for my sistas
For my sistas
Let me see you throw your hands up
Verse 2
Now when I say Pig
You say B-I-G
When I say Bad Boy killer
Then you say me
When I say Puffy is a punk, you scream word on my life
I wrote this shit while fuckin' Big's wife
Now I been told that Lil Kim thinks she hot
She not
Plus now Da Brat's trippin'
Must want an ass whippin'
We be the first ones to fuck with you and Bad Boy, weak bitch
Bustin' through Brooklyn, lickin' my shots to Queens
'Cause I'm lookin' for Little Shawn, that bitch ass fiend
I made him scream like last year
Best don't come to California, we don't want your busta ass here
We outlaw, ryders, thugs til we die
Niggas gettin' high
Call me a motherfuckin' troublemaker
Send me to jail
But watch me bust on LL
This is for the riders
Only for the riders
For the riders
This is for the riders
This is for the bitches
Only for the bitches
For the bitches
Let me see you throw your hands up
This is for them bustas
Only for them bustas
For them bustas
Let me see you throw your hands up
This is for my niggas
Only for my sistas
For my riders
Let me see you throw your hands up
Look at it, did it
We up outta here
2Pac and Storm
Outlaw Immortalz
Death Row, west side
THUG LIFE, beyatch...
Because we all spring
we are not created equally
or in the vast forest in which it breathes
the tree must fight 2 breed
among the evils of the weeds
I find greatness in the tree
that grows against all odds
it blossoms in darkness
and gives birth 2 promising pods.
I was the tree who grew from weeds
and wasn't meant 2 be
ashamed I'm not in fact I am proud
of my thriving family tree
Yo Ryan man (yo what's up cuz)
I just sorted block girls (what's up)
I'm tryna talk to her but, we ain't even explain what happened (straight up man)
It was funk, she was fine (she was fine) (she was takin' over dude, what you think)
She was fine some of us scream for magazine (just shit up)
(I wanna know what's up with that)
Check this out man (what's up)
Trapped like a prisoner, fantasize of kissin' her
Treat you like a queen but other guys is dissin' ya
I wonder if you know how much I think of you
If I can throw you water, then I sink in you
It's for eternity, this feelings are burnin' me
It's like a fire, this desire yearns to be pullin' me
Closer, until your chest is close to mine
But don't wanna rush you, so I'm still waitin'
What if we were lovers, what a night that be
Cause we be raidin' undercover like the savage beast
Then wake up and realize, it was not real
It was just my heart, playin' tricks on me
Cause just thinkin' about ya baby, makes you want ya more
These feelings make me crazy but I can't ignore
What you mean to me, you're a dream to me
No matter how realistic it seems to be
Gotta get a grip on myself, because I'm dissin' myself
I wake up, I realize that I be kissin' myself
And hope that someone in this world is who meant for me
But if I find her, will I have the nerve to speak?
Or will me ego overrob makin' my heart to greed?
I gotta do it, I gotta tell her how I feel
Now my heart beats fast, I sweat feat on my thumb
Gotta get myself together cause here she come
I said: hi, she was fly, get lost in her eyes
Tried to speak another word but my tongue was tied
Every time I try to speak, I stutter again
Feel like I'm ready to cry, embarrassed outof  my mind
She smiles and gives me her number and says call her sometime
And it hit me, I never even knew her name
So when I turned around, I felt my heart broke
She was gone, so was the number she wrote
It was a fantasy
Nothin' but a fantasy
I fell in love with a fantasy
Straight man (word man I feel you)
Oh cuh (well do it your way man)
But check this out man I just coming from the crib man, oh man
She's [?] I can't believe this man (what's up what)
Let me tell you [?] is sayin'
(break it down to be do, what's up)
Check this out
I woke up this Thursday mornin' in a terriful mood
Went straight to the kitchen cause I needed some food
Step inside, the kitchen door had tell me what I would see
A giant stackin' dirty dishes are waitin' for me
Spill out all my funky tequila swisher and my feline hat
Tell my [partner, "Hmm, I think I'll go for a ride"
I see my homie on the corner, "What's up, Terry T?"
Told me that he knew a lady that I needed to meet
Super fine like wine and she couldn't be beat
I said, "Okay," he said: "Come on in," then we went to her house
And here I am cold fuzzin' like I'm in disgrace
She had a beautiful smile, eyes greener than grass
And god damn, homeboy you shoulda see that well
I don't wanna get explicit, but you know what I mean
The type of girl that don't recover of a magazine
She said her name is Limay, I didn't know what to say
We went outside and had a drink, conversated a bit
Terry said we had to leave, but then she told me to sit
She said: "Terry, you can go, but Ryan's stayin' awhile"
When she said this to my homie I just started to smile
She says she wanted to talk, so she can know me some more
I said, "Cool"
Terry left and then she locked door
Now I'm a cool type of fellow, really mellow with her
And when she came and step beside me I had sweat in my palms
I mean she was so fine, I can't explain to my brothers
Finer than the dilla Ice T's album cover
I said, "Well, here we are. What we can do now?"
She said, "Ryan D., as hard as this may seem, I wanna make love to you, you're the man of my dreams"
She said she saw me before, and then she knew that day
I said, "Baby, don't you worry, cause I think I'm in love. You're the angel of my life, sent from heaven above"
Without a moment's hesitation, we were deep in the groove
Only with persistent movements, I removed her clothes
She was heavy as the kiss she began to moan
First she start, twist me back I really don't know how
She put her arms around my neck and said, "I want you now"
She was already hot, I had began to sweat
I knew that this would be a moment I would never forget
She told me lay on my back so she can get on the top
She said, "Make it last, please, and just don't stop"
I got up, rubbed my eyes
It was then I realized that I was home in my bed
I said, "Damn," to myself, as hard as it may seem
Imagination had to go but it was only a dream
It was a fantasy
Nothin' but a fantasy
Damn, man. That's hard, man
Man, it was bugged out
Ain't that weird, though? We both felt like that?
Just remember that shit, man
Word
I don't know what to tell you, man
Yo, see you later on, dude
Alright. Know what it was, though?
It was a fantasy
Nothin' but a fantasy
We fell in love with a fantasy
We fell in love with a fantasy
We fell in love with a fantasy
Look, Look
My every single thought is caught up in collecting cream
A made nigga; picture me dying in a blaze of gun fire
Will not retire til I'm paid, turn the base up higher
When we ride, we fly by, bitches blow me kisses
Niggas from Compton to Brooklyn come on get your riches
Rolling with niggas from Long Beach to Long Isl'
I hardly smile cause my heart froze
And now I, got One Nation it's a crooked compilation
Just to end the bullshit, let's get back to money making
Tell them busters that I rolled on controlling the house
My shit is so wicked when I flip, niggas closing their mouth
The Cocoa Brodaz, Buckshot the BDI Thug
Greg Nice, L.S., Asu, so show a nigga love, Outlaw!
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff life cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high cause you never know when you gonna go

Paparazzi, chase us through the tunnel in the Maserati
On parole for robbery
Ain't no coppin a plea, ain't no stoppin a G
I'm in the 6 you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
They call me the Don Dada
Even rottweilers, follow, the Impala
Wanna talk about this concrete? nigga I'm a scholar
The incredible, hetero-sexual, credible

Time Warner full of sissies, tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites whistlin' Dixie
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure

Did I cry when they dropped me? (nah), can they stop me? (won't)
Tryna sell 4 million copies (done)
If I wasn't spittin' it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we comin' from
And we can't stop
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high cause you never know when you gonna go
Lifes a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff life cause you never know when you gonna go

{Omar Epps - Q}
You're crazy man!
{2Pac - Bishop}
You know what? When you said that last time
I was kinda trippin' right, but now
You're right, I am crazy
But you know what else? I don't give a fuck
Check it out
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
Rather be buried than be worried, livin' held down
My game plan to be trained heavy, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sittin' in the cemetery
Cryin', I've been lost since my adolescence, callin' to Jesus
Ballin' as a youngster, wonderin' if he sees us
Young black males, crack sales got me three strikes
Livin' in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin'?
Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitchin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas in my click that make they motherfucking jaws tight now
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas in my click that make they motherfucking jaws tight
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas in my click that make they motherfucking jaws tight now
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight
I got some niggas in my click that make they motherfucking jaws tight
The Evil Genius
Throw them dubs up
{2Pac - Bishop}
You gotta snatch some collars and let them motherfuckers know you there to take them out
{Xzibit}
The love's been lost, the gloves is off, so figure
What side you tryin' be on, the barrel or the trigger?
A gang of niggas talkin' the talk, but ain't walkin' the straight line
They tryin' to hide behind the one time
Fuck being scary and constantly with security
I ain't afraid of whatever you faggots try to do to me
Shoot at me, try to corner me, orderlies try to get at me
And have you runnin' for your motherfuckin' lives
Till they put me in a courtroom fightin' for mines
When niggas mumble under they breath, I'm under their skin, so then
I pray for the strength to handle what my city bring
Better stand for something, or your bound to fall for anything
The pitfalls, the potholes, I spit flows that generate straight crack sales, we got those
One hitter quitter split a nigga like a embryo
Bring it to your crib, to your kids, to your video shoot
Give me the loot, my dues all paid up
The half-assed gettin' rat packed and sprayed up
You're transparent, Reynold's wrap, I'm seein' clear through
Mister rack rack the gauge and kick in the do'
And motherfuckers tryna say I couldn't rap no mo'
Lets go!
Dirty Harry
I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker
Do you have the heart to see a nigga, before you bust?
Bustin' motherfuckers out the box, I ain't even go!
Now how the hell do you explain, my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got 'em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses to stay alive
Skinny ass player watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Lord Forgive me
The Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Until my death
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
God bless my soul
They got me runnin' from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target, oh shit!
That's all y'all got man?
That nigga P-Double got that shit for y'alls
Peoples to rock to, stirrin' up pots of brew
In hell's kitchen, I chef the impossible
Sit down and sup with the top rap reps
We the streets that's watchin', boy, move diligent
Infamous
Might catch me in a burgundy chair, my shirt blockin'
Fresh with my bandanna and Timbs, we outta there
Army bags full of money, bullet proof this
And that too, put some in the roof
Niggas be shootin' from windows, we untouchable
Yea we is rich thugs, that shoot up clubs
Make albums that click more than little drugs
They got me runnin' from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
They got me runnin' from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
Niggas know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
I don't want no shit but niggas trip and, yo, it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
It's a man's world, niggas get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey!
I'm gettin' sweated by these undercovers
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
Don't turn around I ain't givin' up, cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me, bury me!
They got me runnin' from the police, nowhere to go
But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
They got me runnin' from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
I'd rather fire on my target, oh shit! (x2)
One love to my homeboys, death to my enemies
Bad boy killaz, Outlaw muthafuckin' Immortalz
You know what time it is
When we ride (when we ride)
Thug niggas 'til the day we die
Tell me baby, what's your frequency?
You see I'm makin' proposals that's full of verbal indecency when ya meetin' me
Got three strikes, you got these last nights for thugs
Holdin' my position, my competition is never ready
So what they tell me through the grapevine
Retaliation takes time
Create rhymes that so ferocious that the bass line
Went for my vocals every time a nigga say his rhyme
Nigga get scared, I'm eternally thuggin'
Like kamikazes on a suicide mission
I'm spittin' multiple gunshots burnin', turnin' rappers to victims
I make it ruff enough, you and Puffy crawl away
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, quick to unload
Keepin' niggas suspicious
Two Glocks is full of ammo
My army fatigues ready for battle, lyrical commando
Tell me nigga, how much you can handle
Bangin' on wax, I turn this track into a roman candle (boom)
My intention's specifically, thugged out no sympathy
Pictures of closed caskets, soon as Daz's get wit' me
Soon as my niggas break, we earthquake the whole planet
Adversaries can't understand it
Don't nobody die unless we planned it
No matter how hard muthafuckaz try, they can't get it
Westside, Outlawz 'til we die, thug life
Muthafuckaz on the ride and we
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Call me my enemy killer, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you eye to eye
Nigga, I've been straight feudin' for years
Ain't nuthin' nice right here
I get the poundin' from the drum, that's how I overcome fear
Give me your soul out ya life, hand it to me like I'm Christ
I look at death to be nice, I wanna try it some nights
And I swear to God, I get medieval on your bastard catch wreck
Mama told you to knock me out, but you ain't knock shit yet
Claimin' you mobbin' deep, with your pity ass crew
If you a soldier, ask ya homie could it be me and you
Head up first, I'll kill your work, I got you lost so you hurt
A flurry combination then I leave your dick in the dirt
Nigga, I leave you shell shocked
From project streets to cell blocks
Glock 45 with the tail cocked
Makin' jacks by no means
Pocket full of crack and money stacks in my jeans
Wildin' on ya street high off codeine's (codeine's)
I ask some questions after I open fire on your sector
On the fuckin' walk by
Uh
Now how many niggas really think they can oppose
Dumpin', but takin' it out first at every function
Nigga, we funkin' [?] blows
Is hittin' yo jaw and now you hittin' the flo'
Obvious you didn't know what we known fo'
Nigga we
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Call me my enemy killer, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you eye to eye
Yeah... knockin' niggas the fuck out
Yeah nigga, you know how we do when we ride up on your bitch ass
Got three strikes, you got these last night's for thugs
Holdin' my position my competition is never ready
Ripped like a machete, my alias Makaveli
So what they tell me through the grapevine
Retaliation takes time
Create rhymes that so ferocious that the bass line
Went for my vocals every time a nigga say his rhyme
Spendin' and bustin' you thought it up, but you wasn't prepared
Nigga get scared, I'm eternally thuggin'
Like Kamikazes on a suicide mission
I'm spittin' multiple gunshots burnin', turnin' rappers to victims
I kick 'em all day
And our motto was make 'em all pay
You think you rough enough? Nigga you crawl away
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your side
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
That's when the slaughter begin, that's when I murdered your friend
You crazy ass thinking its back runnin', runnin'
Runnin' the streets again, with AKs and Mac-10s
This on escape from the heaters [?]
You and your homie is gone, when we ride up on you
And we ride like a roller, all dog to talk
5 double o B-E-N-Z DAG
DPG showin' the place to be
Wow this [?] will split the fella in flat
Leavin' suckers stuckin'
Gang bang bang
I'm from the mad ass dogg pound
Always down for the dolo

First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye

Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your side
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
Keepin' niggas suspicious, 2 Glocks
Lyrical commando, let's get it on
Tell me nigga, how much you can handle
Bangin' on wax, I turn the track into a Roman Candle (boom)
My intention specifically, thugged out, no sympathy
Pictures of closed caskets, soon as Daz's get with me
I'm first to bomb, first is the calm, then the panic
Adversaries can't understand it
The way my niggas strategize
Don't nobody die unless we planned it
Life long committed, I write songs and spit it
No matter how hard mothafuckas try they can't get it
It's West Coast, Westside, Outlawz 'til we die, Thug Life
Mothafuckas on the ride and we--
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your side
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
I come from battle rap, nigga imagine that
For every nigga that you got I got for the match
Nigga you better give it up nigga or die for its spot
The cash and jewelry get my avenges kinda blind
My vision ain't blurry, told mama don't worry
Now I got the streets strapped, the stripes in glory
If I live to tell a story about the gangstas and thugs
The homies [?] that drug through the mud
Weed, money, alcohol, with AKs
Sprayed flap for your dope and you're not
Come beating then you bow for the niggas get shot, motherfucker
Come be my enemy killa, when I see you eye to eye

Young Niggas, Young Niggas
U say that u'll love me forever but what about today
As the dusks become dawns and the years pass on will u love me the same way
If so let us rejoice and bathe in constant pleasure
I just wanted 2 know if you'd love me forever
Before Today would START!
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Can you imagine when this race is won
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad men
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young
As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
Two two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young
Now, everytime I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga, it's a God damn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game?
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket
How long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head, but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck, motherfuckers, I'm loc
They all duckin' when my gun smoke
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad men
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Now, I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son, we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die
Been tryin' to make a million by hustlin since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at 8D, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back
Forever, my niggas be together
Ain't shit without your homeboys
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad men
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young
(Laughs) We're going platinum nigga, we going platinum
We get my nigga Treach from Naughty By Nature up in this motherfucker
My nigga Apache up in this motherfucker
My Mossberg goes boom, gimme room, can I catch it
Talkin' quicker then a vic that's tryin' to keep from gettin' blasted
I had enough I put a hit upon them bastards
Boo-yaa, turn this Benz into a casket
Buck buck, big up and livin' reckless
Niggas with a death wish step in with a TEC and I'll wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
True to what I'm writing, representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm what's mine
I'm old fashioned, run up on me, nigga, and get blasted
With five deadly venomz
That old deadly shit. Aiyyo Treach where you at?
Step up and hit they ass up with the wickedness)
We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
To the Onyx of your nose, punk is funky like skunk blunts
Stunk like funk cunt
I come to take you on a war rough and rugged route
And if another doubts I blow your fuckin' mother out
I shout, "I'm de MC wit de nasty mouf!" and kick the bitch out
Sue me? I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin' pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya pickin' shit
Not shoplift, I'm liftin' shop
Once you sound hot, 'cause if you ain't a perfect ten
My sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin' styles in 'em
Like women I did 'em I'm in for deadly ready venom
Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Mad
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
Breakin' 'em down, I make 'em see their doom
Rob and steal and runnin' from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make 'em scatter, leavin' trails of brains and bladders
Blowin' 'em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, something that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit 'em, I lit him
He's out! A poison, a deadly venom
(Yeah Mad, fuck that! You know how we do
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent)
Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggas can't touch me when I wreckin' G you better flee
'Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
Uhh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking all fake niggas back to the stomping grounds
Line 'em up single file, dome runnin' in 'em
A nigga hit 'em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom
(Nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin? Fuck that!
I told you, we takin' over, yo 'Pac.)
Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin' and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggas don't even worry me, see
I got a Glock that say 'Pac run the block
As I sit and reminisce about the old days
I say niggas need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everyday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I passed let the glass spray
Deadly venomz
(Hahaha, yeah pass that shit over here
Apache bout to clean shit up)
Throw up your middle finger! Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'mma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin' trigger
I'm a cinch in a clinch, your punch is like a pinch.
Fuckin' up pooh-butts, cut 'em like cold cuts
Choke 'em with my boot lace, then leave 'em hangin' like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get 'em
That's the results of fuckin with the fifth venom in denim
(Yeah, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Five motherfuckin deadly venomz, in effect for ninety-three
Ninety-four ninety-five all that other shit
We takin this motherfucker over this larger hit
YaknowhatI'msayin? Follow us, come along. Yaknowhat I'msayin?
We takin this motherfucker over. TRUST. We out.)
This poem is addressed 2 Mrs. Hawkins
I'm not out 2 offend the positive souls
only the racist dogs who lied 2 me
An American culture plagued with nights
like the night Yusef was killed
if it were reversed it would be the work
of a savage but this white killer was just strong-willed
But Mrs. Hawkins as sure as I'm a Panther
America will never rest
if Yusef dies in vain!
West Coast after shop (C'mon)
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
For all my bitches and my niggas
(We don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck)
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
See these other fools but you can't see me, nigga
Who am I?
So slow your roll, I'm In Control like Janet
The loc-est twenty-one year old nigga that's on this planet
Take it for granted, if ya wanna, because I'm gonna
Grab my strap then clear the corner, beeotch
So all my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
To all my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin hands in the air
Now on a one, two, three who could it be
So ninety-four's arrived nigga, back on up
Now can't nobody see me here or there
Wherever I bails, I put it down all around
Cuz ain't shit for sale in the Coupe
With the beat flossin' off gold D's
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much, for the Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for getting us all fucked up
Now check it, it's a calling for niggas like Doggs
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin' like hoes
(Yes y'all) other Doggs (yes y'all) yiggy y'all
Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball
I packs a strap, like that, I kicks it like this
Now how many bitches must get dicked?
Before they say, okay, Daz that nigga from back in the day
Ya never ever thought I'd see him bustin with Dr. Dre
Cuz I grips mics, I rips mics in half
Hoes be coming to my flat so I can tap that ass
So all my bitches and my niggas
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Wave your motherfuckin hands in the air
And if you don’t give a fuck like we don’t give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin hands in the air
And my niggas say, we want the fame!
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Searching for fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
Though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to G's
Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
They got me hot when they shot me, plotted my revenge
To increase my ends, enemies gettin' dropped
Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true
Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
And for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame
What's to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? The world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane, I'm hopin' we can change with time
I'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse
And worse yet, with each breathe, steps I take, breathless
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask
I'm the first one to want him blasted
Wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit (Outlawz)
Ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fake in fame
(Fuck 'em all)
Something thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
Something thing we all adore
Something we dying for
Searching for fortune and fame
Double up nigga double up
It’s my cell nigga, it's my cell

So on this day forth, I'ma die for the fortune and fame (fame)
Been on my name (fame) where were all these years that I walk this earth
Went for all mine (we search for fame) especially been cautious since birth
Even though I live my life hellishly (fame) for all this fame (fame)
Block fronters shoot slugs we throw 'em back like hardballs
No love for these fake desperadoes and thugs (hahaha)
I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts sipping Henny
Drunk nights And high days
Cocking my heat shooting it sideways
A life on the run (ey look out, look out)
Fulfillin' my destiny for needs and ones desires
Be pulling all my cabbage like pliers
Stuck in the trance searching for something higher
Than fortune and fame
Hahaha
Something we all adore
Something we dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Something we all adore
Something we dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
I don't want to live forever, it's do or die
I'd be a dead nigga talking gangsta S.P.I
Niggas don't want me to be up in they system when I'm deceased
Talk shit about when I'm up in the coffin nigga you'll rest in peace (well alright)
Motherfucker, I die for this shit, I got a lot ridin'
Some niggas be players up in the game five years
Some niggas be making one platinum album
Motherfucking hard since I was fo-teen, partners (fo-teen partna)
Some niggas be laying up in them streets, broke 'em off somethin' proper
Haters may try to take your soul cold-hearted ass niggas
Niggas don't want to see you have nothing, so have something
And if a nigga run up on you, put a slug and get to dumping nigga
Fame...
Something we all adore
Something we dying for
Stuck in this pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
Something we all adore
Something we dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Nothing but pain...
Stuck in this gaaaaaame
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why don't y'all sing some shit acapella man?

You heard that shit, nigga
Ay, yo, what you going with that big ass
My ghetto love song, set it off, set it off
Where my niggas', where my niggas'
Where my niggas' at, all my real niggas'
Where my niggas', where my niggas'
Let's be friends, throw your hands in the air
There's no need to front
Let's see you just throw your hands in the air
Let's be friends, Westside in this motherfucka right here
Throw your hands in the air, Westside
All on my double 'R', tinted
My eye's freshly scented
What's the happ's baby, what's up
Come get with me and perhaps lady
You can help me multiply my stacks, baby
Currency seems small, I need companionship
I bet your man ain't shit, ain't shit
So why you're hesitating
Check out my diamonds, bitch, everyone's going to blink
This be a thug paid outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreaming motherfucka on a mash for bitches
Smoking on big weed, keyed the Cali way, Westside!
Don't like tricking but I'll buy you what fit
I can't stand no sneaker-wearing nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree breathe reason, this' OG
Putting bitch-made busters' to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called car, who the man
While I'm tugging on your made-bitch's hand, Westside
Understand this, ain't no nigga like me
Fuck Jay Z, he's broke and I smoke daily
Baby, let's be friends
Friends, where's my niggas' at, come on y'all
No need to front, let's be friends
Because I know you want to fuck
Let's be friends, no need to front, let's be friends
Because I know you want to fuck
I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass, got me checking for you hardcore
Staring and watching, me and you one on one
Erotic, psychotic, would possess my body
Far from a crush, I want to bust your guts
And touch everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweating like a fat girl going for mine
Just a skinny nigga's fucking like she stole my mind
Back in time, I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in nine-six, fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre, tell that bitch, 'He can kiss my ass'
Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs, now let me in-between as friends
Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks
I got her ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
Was it me or the fame, my dick or the game
Bet I scream 'Westside' when I came, Westside
Up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby, let your back dip into it, make it fluent
In and out, all around when a nigga do it
You've got me high, let me come inside
I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride
Who wants to stop me, am I top notch
Fuck player-hating niggas' because they cock block
What's the game, rather see a nigga up in prison
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good in this world of G's
Baby's got me fantasizing, seeing you naked
It's a fuck song, check the record, so check my record
Make money, take money, let's get paid
Pawhoo hoo hoo hoo

So why you hesitatin', actin' like yo' shit don't stink?
Check out my diamonds, bitch, everyone gonna blink
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreamin', motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my résumé, sippin' on Cristal and Alize
Smokin' on big weed, keyed the Cali way
Don't like trickin', but I'll buy you a fit
I can't stand no sneaker-wearin' nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree, read briefly, this O.G
Puttin' bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called car, who the man?
While I'm tuggin' on your main bitch head
Understand this: Ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay Z!
He broke and I smoke daily, baby, let's be
Friends
There's no need to front, let’s be friends

Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Me and you, one on one, picture countless options
Erotic, psychotic, would possess my body
Far from a crush, I wanna bust your guts and touch
Everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweatin' like a fat girl goin' for mine
Just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind
Back in time, I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in 9-6? Fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre! Tell that bitch he can kiss my ass!

Was it me or the fame, my dick or the game
Bet I scream 'Westside' when I came, Westside
Scream my name because, baby, it's delicious
Got a weak spot for pretty bitches
Up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby, let your back dip into it, make it fluid
In and out, all around when a nigga do it
You've got me high, let me come inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride!
Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?
Fuck player hatin' niggas cuz they cockblock
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor and weed

Baby's got me fantasizin', seein' you naked
It's a fuck song, now check the record
Let's be friends!

Make money, take money
Make money, take money
Come on, get your cash on
Let's get paid
Listening to the radio, wishing that I could rap
'Cause everybody in the industry was fucking me, man
Listen; I've got a scheme, break away, do my own thing
Drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas ain't wanna see me rise
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case, Lord knows how they hate me
Got a player in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards living as a thug
Count my blessings and throw my stressings in this land with no love
Maybe they see me rolling, look at all this green I'm holding
I get this why they envious and get their eyes swollen
Hoping the heavenly father love a hustler
Meet the hardest nigga on the Earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me, "Have a heart" — fuck their feelings
I've been trying to make a million since we started, we cold hearted
Empty out my clip, time to mash, they asked for it
Me, Makaveli, I'm a motherfucker
Niggas talk a lot of non-shit I choose to ignore it
Now what'cha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
Now what'cha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
Tell me now what'cha gonna do, When my niggas
Come for you?
Now what'cha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
Watch me clown, give me loving when I'm high
I'm an outlaw baby, I'll be thugging 'til I die
In my drop-top double-R, life as a rap star
Go ask somebody to your show
Watch them niggas out the sight of my night scope
Cooking white dope got my nigga 25-to-life stretched out
Trying to have all the better things in life
Well Makaveli — a born leader, 10 millimeter
Change a nigga's future like a schizophrenic palm reader
And the strong will lead
Hittin' weed like it's alright
I'm in the studio making music all night
My enemies cry whenever I rise, they hated 'til the death
Trying to beat me out my last breath
Whatcha gonna do?
Tell me now what'cha gonna do, When my niggas
Come for you?
Come for you?
What'cha gonna do, When my niggas come for you?
Who's to blame for my mind frames?
This poverty does money game
Got me fiendin' for riches wantin' to kill for a taste of fame
Recurrin' dreams of illest ears, front page magazines
Livin' life like a thug queen
But instead, I'm having nightmares
They call 'em Outlaw premonitions of premeditated missions
Livin' conditions suspicious, so they got me on they hit-list
Wishin' that I was slip like a wet bitch
And I've been waiting for years, I put my grind in nigga
I see you smoking, 'cause I got what you wanna flaunt
My every calculated move is a nail through your coffin
Thugged out female war shot-caller
Now what you gonna do?
(When we come for ya)
Now whatcha gonna do when my niggas come for you?
Now, nigga now, now whatcha gonna do when my niggas come for you?
Now whatcha gonna do when my niggas come for you
(Throw your hands up), now whatcha gonna do when my niggas come for you
(Whatchu running fo'), now whatcha gonna do when my niggas come for you?
(Busted), Now whatcha gonna do when my niggas for you?
(when we come for ya)
Now whatcha gonna do when my niggas for you
Hahaha
(When they come for you)
(When they come for you )
Shhh
When they come for you
From first glance I know exactly what would Be
The circumstances don't even matter because my heart never lies
And if u don't admit 2 this it is u who will be surprised
"I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends"
I don't need nobody
Fuck 'em… fuck all y'all (fuck all y'all)
Money gone fuck friends, I need a homie that know me
When all these motherfuckin' cops be on me
Now what the fuck is happenin' with my ballin' cats?
Remember me? I'm your homie that was down to brawl
Sippin' Hennessy, hangin' with the clowns, and all
We used to do is drink brew, screw and common knew
We had bitches by the dozens, we fuckin' cousins
A nigga just got paid and we still was broke
It took time, but finally the cash was mine
All the rewards of a hustler stuck in the grind
Look around, and all I see is snakes and fakes
It's like scavengers, waitin' to take a hustler's place
They straight busted and can't be trusted; fuck y'all!
"I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends"
Fuck all y'all
I'm sippin' Tanqueray and juice and what's the use
‘Cause I'm a hopeless thug
Ain't no love reminiscin' on how close we was
Way back in the day, before they put the crack in the way
And heeyyy, how much money can you stack in a day?
It's gettin' rough, collect calls from my niggas in cuffs
I recollect we used to ball, now just living's enough
I stand tall in the winter, summer, spring or fall
I know it's gettin' crazy after dark, these marks
Keep on huffin' and puffin', ain't no fear in my heart
What's goin' on in the ghetto? Still struggle and strive
I still roll with the heater, smokin' chocolate thai
In '94, I'll be goin' solo
Too many problems of my own so I'm rollin' dolo; fuck all y'all!
Huh, pardon me!
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got.."
Fuck all y'all ...fuck all y'all
I went from rags to riches
Went from a bucket to a rag with switches
I'm gettin' high, and like I said, it was some chocolate thai
Mixed with some Indonesia, watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me
Hit the weed and I continue doin' 90
Until I get caught, another ticket get to kick it in court
Fuck the law, give a shit, I'm even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
But I ain't worried, still throwin' these thangs
Got me locked in these chains
And hey, nigga, what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout?
Soon as I hit the cell, I'll be bailin' out
And when I hit the streets, I'm in a rush to ball
I'm screamin' "Thug Life!", nigga, fuck y'all!
"I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends"
That’s right fuck all y'all man
Fuck all y’all
Fuck all the hard copies daily news
Fuck all y’all
Fuck 'em
You a what? Bad Boy Killaz
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Hahaha, yeah, nigga, fuck 'em all!
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Fuck all you muthafuckers!
Ayo, Biggie, put your hands up!
My rappin' is similar to mothafuckers when they scrappin'
Blast and watch 'em back up
Notorious Biggie killer, affiliation with Death Row
Niggas get their caps peeled back, fool, this the West Coast
Bitch, you misdemeanor, I'm raisin' hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated, we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks, that thought I quit
Then got a drop top Jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggas to trip ‘cause, bitch, I love to scrap
Mama raised me as a thug nigga, with love niggas
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from trustin' these tricks
Now they all want to sue me, so fuck 'em all!
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
I'm addicted to these streets, like crack is to these creeps
Seein' visions of a prison, wake up screamin' in my sleep
Is there a heaven in this hell? A possibility of livin' well?
But if they killin' me, I get my stripes and whose to tell
Choosin' to sell, I'd rather die and be deceased
Now, put your muthafuckin' hands up if you's a rider (Ride)
Fuck 'em all, touch 'em all; that's the way that we do it
Ride up, hop the fuck out, watch that bitch nigga lose it
Man, I'm as strong as this game, ya'll be knowin' my name
A young high strung thug nigga created by pain
And my next piece of ass, so fuck 'em all!
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
I do my dirt all by my lonely
Don't need no phony homie to call me
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Nigga, we Outlaw riders
Don't give a fuck if you love us, we thuggin'
I got glad bags with enemies, cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessy, so they relatives know it's me
Ridin' these hoochies like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up
I'm bustin' with self-defense, you see
Poppin' nobody got 'em, holla
Vacate the scene, count the cash and stash the precious metal
Here come the coppers, the S.W.A.T. team and the helicopters
Them crackers is crazy, why? ‘Cause they'll never stop us
I watched Arnold Schwarzenegger bust somebody in a movie
Niggas is too through, true to the game
I claim Outlaw riders, we give a fuck what they try, I'm…
‘Cause Young Noble behind it
Kick back, lil' nigga, and watch the game
Get your mob rocked and what-not
We keep it poppin', like a drug spot
The streets know what's hot, trust me
Even my hood call me "baby Malcolm X"
With the TEC's, shower some slugs on 'em
Always in grind mood, hustle to find food
Ever seen Faces of Death? That's what my 9 do
Even rap with a gat, I must be goin' out my mind
Like I'm up against the world, this guerilla team of mine
Even if the last nigga left I'ma ride for 'em
Feel me? Until they kill me, that's how I'm rollin'
"Fuck 'em all, let them die!" – that's my slogan; fuck 'em all!
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
I do my dirt all by my lonely
Don't need no phony homie to call me
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
You want to know how I did this shit? You want to know how real my shit is?
Nigga, go read the mothafuckin' newspaper, you trick-ass nigga
How many broke-down rappers got some shit to say?
I sit and strategize, in due time, them bitches pay
Plus all day, I puff weed till my eyes bleed red
Check this, I know you niggas got no love for me
But how the fuck your whole clique turn to thugs, homie?
Like misdemeanors, it's a small thang
You niggas ain't ready for war, let my balls hang
I bust at Bad Boy, Mobb Deep and murder The Firm
When you scream "Fake thugs," who the fuck you mean?
Get more cream than all of y'all, nigga, fuck your team
Now Dre want to switch sides, tricks hide in war
Last year, I shed tears, but I don't cry no more
Plus Jay-Z tried to play me, won't last long
Go ask King Sun how it feel to have your ass gone
Listen Doo-Wop, don't get your shit knocked, you can't win
Yeah nigga, y'all niggas can't fade this shit
And sold 5 million
I'm a self-made millionaire!
Thug livin', out of prison
Pistols in the air
More then the Firm, more then Bad Boy, murder Mobb Deep)
5 shots couldn't drop me: I took it and smiled (3x)
(3rd time parallel:) Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my A-K, I'm still the thug that you love to hate (love to hate, love to hate)
First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Little Ceasar go ask you homie how I'll leave you
Cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces
Now be deceased
Little Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
So fuck peace
So let the Westside ride the night
Bad Boys murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get your caps peeled
You know
Pawhoo hoo hoo hoo, live from the crazyhouse
I don’t wanna be your man, bitch, (fuck that) what you crazy
I don’t wanna be your fuckin' man
I wanna be… yo let me fuck that nigga down

I love it when you get on top, baby, let me ride!
Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?
Fuck player-hatin' niggas, ‘cause they cockblock
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?

Niggas.. fuckin' with the wrong nigga
My seductive introduction be specific
And I'm still lifted; niggas can't get with Mr. Wicked
Picture me flippin' my adversaries, gettin' the dick swiftly
Niggas is swingin' wild, but they styles miss me
Business never personal
I'm up before the sun come up, I'm tired
Just a ghetto star, a drop top double-R is what I'm ridin'
Bring yo' artillery when you come for me, ‘cause we sick thugs
No hesitation when I pull and blast, ‘cause Syke was bustin'
Plus, Bo had 'em duckin', screamin', "Get they cash!"
So now I got the law on me
Tell them niggas this the year when they pull the trigger
This is what you get
When you fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Hehehehe, yeah, nigga, peep it
Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray and thank the Lord
For givin' me another fruitful day
I wanna be a peaceful, man, but still when niggas come for me
All I can see is gettin' 'em killed
For real, it's how I feel
Reflect my thoughts, flowin' on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel; they caps peeled
We still cool, but you played yourself
Give him the MAC and make him spray hisself, heyyy
Puttin' two bullets to they dome, wanted to die in Heaven
Why call in shots? Nobody really as clear as me
Ain't tryin' to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
Murder, my foes get disposed of
We all homies to the death, so my true niggas show me love
God, forgive me for my lifestyle, a negative figure
But why they fuckin' with the wrong nigga
You know?
It's like.., why you fuckin' with the wrong nigga?
I was raised by thugs, schooled by killers
Tried to rise, but they tried me
I guess they all had to die, ‘cause we tried peace
I die in these streets
Blast 'til they recognize
Still do or die, all my niggas gettin' high, watchin' time fly
Best strategize on the way to profit
Best organize how you ride, so they can't stop it
Then keep it poppin', lot of busters wanna see me fall
I fucked your bitch, and now this new shit, gon', fade 'em all
My niggas ball, made a call for some back-up
The lil' homies and my dogs in the black truck
"Buck buck" was the sound as they gats burst
How you figure makin' moves on the wrong nigga
When you fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Niggas gettin' hit, when they fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Punk Police
Oh you too, nigga
Don't think we ain't talking about your punk ass
You ol' fake ass nigga
Here we go
Turn it up let it start
From block to block we snatchin hearts
And jackin' marks
You made me
Crooked-ass beast something daisy
I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine
Get up
Cause it's time to make that pay back
Fact
Black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth
Tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
This what we burned the other week -uh
Now we go him in the smash - blast
How long will it last until the po' get mo' cash?
To my young black males, BLAZE up
Life's a mess
Don't stress - test
Or give in
Much love to my brothas in the Pen
See ya when I free ya
Not when they shove me in
Thug for life
High till I die
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Lettin' it fly
Tell 'em
Thug for life
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Lettin 'it fly
Tell 'em
High till I die
Lettin' it fly
Tell 'em
Thug for life
High till I die
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Pump your fists like this
Holla if you hear me
Pump pump if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin it up

I'm supposed to say "peace" sing songs and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan - BAMN!
I'll be swingin like a one man klan
Thug for life
High till I die
Shootin crooked-ass cops
Lettin' it fly
Tell 'em
Thug for life
High till I die
"The good part about is, we get to show the human side of cops doing what they do
Cause, it's always been my belief that cops are just a gang themselves- with the good and the bad
Like I believe the gang bangers on the street got both good and bad like the police officers do
They got stress and they got character flaws that come from their lifestyles
I could be the best actor that anybody seen
Given the chance, the opportunity, and the experience and the lessons from people, I could be the best...
But right now I don't wish to the best, I just want to be one of them
If you look at it from a stereotypical point of view, like how people say, you know
'All your troubles with the law, how can you play a cop?'
Just from a stereotypical point of view
Who could play a cop better?
I've seen them and their evil when they think nobody's looking. I've seen the  compassion, I've seen the anger, I've seen the jealousy, I've seen fear,  I've seen respect and I've seen hate- from cops
More than anybody, know what I mean? I been there. I just got out of maximum penitentiary
Who you callin' rapist? Ain't that a bitch
You devils are so two faced
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
And gettin' stalked by these crooked cops again
Fuckin' with the young Black male, tryin' to stack bail
And um, stay away from the packed jails
And that's why I had that .45 with one in the chamber
They tryna say that I don't care
Just woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!"
They tryna say that I don't care
Uhh, I woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!"
Just got up and screamed "Fuck the world!"
When I was comin' up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin' flex to me, comin' from my enemies
And in their dreams it's hell where they sendin' me
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Never take your eyes off the prize and even if you gettin' high
Don't ever hesitate to try
'Cause you can fall off or stay ballin', niggas, we all in
And them my motherfuckers callin'
Fuck the world!
They tryna say that I don't care
Woke up screamed "Fuck the world!"
They tryna say that I don't care
Just woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!"
They tryna say that I don't care
I got up and screamed "Fuck the world!"
They're tryna say that I don't care
I woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!"
They're tryna say that I don't care
(Man, Fuck the world)
Cause I'm sittin' here sippin' on Guinness
Weighin' 165 and these tricks should die
For being jealous of a brother when he rise
I can see it in your eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin'
They hate to see a nigga ballin'
Some of you suckers is rotten, plottin' on what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him (Booyeah)
Stop givin' game for free, you wanna hang with me
Like being a thug is the thang to be
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped
They tryna say that I don't care
I woke up screamed "Fuck the world!"
They tryna say that I don't care
I woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!"
They tryna say that I don't care
I got up and screamed "Fuck the world!"
Haha, Fuck the world!
Fuck it
I hear my niggas screamin' "Fuck the world"
They wanna know if I claim the clique that I'm hangin' with
And if I'm down with this bangin' shit
Well homie I don't give a fuck if you Blood or Cuz
Long as you got love for thugs
But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped
Then it's back to the corner where we sell crack
A straight thug motherfucker who ain't scared to bust
They tryna say that I don't care
They tryna say that I don't care
I woke up screamin' "Fuck the world!"
They tryna say that I don't care (They tryna say that I don't care)
I woke up and screamed "Fuck the world!" (Yeah what’s goin on y’all?)
I don’t care.. I don’t care, I don’t care!
(Intro): 2pac
We takin' this one to the whole 'nother level gutter style thug style
You feel me, things that we can only do as a real G
(Verse 1): 2pac
Hit me, I got my Hennessy find ya foes
In a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm gettin' high off buddha cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough you never find me broke
And who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me

You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
To my niggas up in Quentin, Down on Rikers Isle
Stay rile, but a nigga gotta use his styles
(Hook): 2pac
These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
(Verse 2): 2pac
I could be wrong but I never got along with cops
It's like they stuck from makin' niggas duck from Glocks
And all the time, my mind's full of thoughts of ends
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
Cause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
I hear some sucker screamin' like the demon's inside
Will 'em away in the mornin', only the strong survive
I cry, but in my own way swallow my pride
Cemetery full of brothers I buried it's goin' down
Even now I wonder will I still be around
My hometown is the gutter I was born a wild
I came up out this dust with my heartless style
(Hook): 2pac
These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
(Verse 3): Eazy-E
Aw yeah, let's take a trip
Just sit back and light a spliff with this and don't slip
On a funky-dope track jump back
Strapped with a fat boota sack and a 7-8 flak
Come clean, gangsta lean, I got green
But I serve dubs like it ain't no thing I hang with O.G. players don't set trip Or you might get what we call a rat pack I don't slack when it come to street I kick real G funk to a Gangsta beat It's so sweet, when you got money to spend I got a proper big tilt and a fabec Benz
I make ends, spend my dough I'm no foe
That's how it is, and that's how it goes
Givin' love to them playas that I know is real G's
(Hook): 2pac
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
(Verse 4): Eazy-E
Dump dump on fools with a quickness
And they got no cure for this sickness
I get paid for the way that I kick this
Like a G-ster, an OG-ster
And I live my life straight crazy
Don't need no punk fools payin' me
And broke groupies and hootchies don't faze me
I take two steps back and release myself
To put platinum and gold on the record shelf
I don't brag, but I do it like a straight up is
Before you do a record, partna, handle your business And don't get caught slippin' on the under
Or you might wonder (What's up on dem ends, G?)
I call a spade a spade, and get paid
G's show the way, so I give love to 'em That O.G.P.I.M PILMO, GILMO
Hip-Hop thugsta, so quick to rush ya
Straight to the dirt, fool I do work
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
That's how it is when it come to me
Cause I'm the short but quickest player name Eazy Women can't play me some say I'm crazy
I give a damn about a skankless trick
Let me hit it one time and trick that's it
But don't trip, gives my dough to no foe
That's how it is, I got no love for ya
These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
Niggas don't know my style
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
Niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
You mothafuckas all about my motherfuckin' hell being though [laughs]
This shit thuggish, fo' life, I told y'all, it's album three see
G sound, freestyle
Motherfuckin' Young Thugs in this motherfucker [laughs]
Dear mama
I robbed my adversaries
But slipped and left a witness
Or will this nigga snitch
Or make the nigga rich?
But damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin
And talkin behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic
I'm in this shit to win it
Here's my chance to spin it
To let them suckers snatch me
Niggas gettin jealous (jealous)
Peter picked a pepper
But I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch
And threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin
But swear I'm nothin nice
Before I take your life
I listen to him scream
Had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over
I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little, bird
He snitched and told a, friend
It's trouble on my mind
I'm with the old timers
They sentenced me to death
Today's my final day
I'm countin every breath
I'm bitter cause I'm dyin
So much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed
I got beef with a sick society
That doesn't give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
He's a crook with a book
That motherfucker never cared for me
He's only here to be sure
I don't drop a dime to God
Bout the crimes he's commitin on the poor
They ain't my peers and in all these years
They ain't never love me
Must be part of some big plan
To keep a nigga in the state pen
They got you trapped
You're better off gettin shot up
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin for the chair
Dear mama
Cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me
I never told you that
Scared what you might do
I couldn't hold you back
I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies
No mercy for a stranger
Is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt
Instead of livin sad in jail
I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm
You can hear his asshole gettin torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin sheep
Niggas countin cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
And your soul is your best friend
Tell the Lord to make way for me
Prepare any day for me (why?)
Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin dead from a rope
First there was nothing
Not even the Faint echo of a song
Loneliness was daily 4 me
There was a gleam of STARS in your eyes
I thought I'd  never feel this way again
But u were the one 2 reach into my heart
And find in me a Friend
I could not ignore the magnetism
that I felt when u were near
And any problems plaguing my mind
would suddenly disappear
It was the rebirth of my heart
The day u became my friend
Because I knew from the moment
I held u that I would find love again
What time is it?
Shit, it's early nigga
It's like (god damn) ten o clock
Fuck it
Ayo im gonna go get some more of that shit
(coughin')
Yeah it's time!
Yeah
Thug life nigga!
What time is it?

Is life worth living should I blast myself?
I’m tired of bein’ poor and even worse I’m black
My stomach hurts so I’m lookin’ for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship ’em dope and let ’em deal the brothers
Give ’em guns step back watch ’em kill each other
Two shots in the dark now Huey’s dead
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin’ changes
And that’s how it’s supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he’s close to me?
I’d love to go back to when we played as kids
But things changed, and that’s the way it is
That’s just the way it is
That’s just the way it is
That’s just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That’s just the way it is
Aww yeah
I see no changes all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let’s erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people they’ll be acting right
‘Cause both black and white is smokin’ crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain’t ready, to see a black President, uhh
It ain’t a secret don’t conceal the fact
The penitentiary’s packed, and it’s filled with blacks
Try to show another way but you stayin’ in the dope game
Now tell me what’s a mother to do
Bein’ real don’t appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
“I made a G today” But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin’ crack to the kid. ” I gotta get paid,”
Well hey, well that’s the way it is
That’s just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That’s just the way it is
Aww yeah
That’s just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That’s just the way it is
Aww yeah
We gotta make a change
It’s time for us as a people to start makin’ some changes
Let’s change the way we eat, let’s change the way we live
And let’s change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn’t working so it’s on us to do
What we gotta do, to survive
And still I see no changes can’t a brother get a little peace
So the police can bother me
And I ain’t never did a crime I ain’t have to do
But now I’m back with the blacks givin’ it back to you
Don’t let ’em jack you up, back you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they can’t touch this
I don’t trust this when they try to rush I bust this
That’s the sound of my tool you say it ain’t cool
My mama didn’t raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
‘Cause I always got to worry ’bout the pay backs
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin’ back after all these years
That’s just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That’s just the way it is
Aww yeah
That’s just the way it is
Things will never be the same
That’s just the way it is
Aww yeah
Some things will never chang
Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‘Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
There's no need for you to fear me
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me
(Ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me
(Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Lord, can you hear me speak?
To pay the price of bein' hellbound
If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit, reminisce thinking a bliss of the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
They tested it was stress that they under
We never really went through that
Cause we was born B.C. - you and me before crack
Everyone's ashamed of the youth cause the truth look - strange
And for me it's reversed
We left them a world that's cursed and it - hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all condemned like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Don't it make em get teary
The world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes see it clearly
There is no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white cause we're human
My Ghetto Gospel
(Chorus, Akon)
Who ever said that this trouble would stop today
A lot of niggas get locked away
Teenage women growing up with AID's
Ghetto
Ohh eating in the
Ghetto
Ohh sleeping in the
Ghetto
That's the life when your living in the
Ghetto
Ohh eating in the
Ghetto
Ohh sleeping in the
Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad
Living out of bags but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy, well guess who's giving birth to a baby
I don't trip to let her fade me
And even now I get discouraged
I wonder if they take it all back will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother will be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress, never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brains when I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy?
Cause I choose to puff a blunt, and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace there's a war in the streets
My Ghetto Gospel
Who ever said that this trouble would stop today
A lot of niggas get locked away
Teenage women growing up with AID's
Cause that's the life when your living in the
Ghetto
Ohh eating in the
Ghetto
Ohh sleeping in the
Ghetto
That's the life when your living in the
Ghetto
Ohh eating in the
Ghetto
Ohh sleeping in the
Gun shot every night in the
Ghetto
Crooked cops on side in the
Everyday is fight in the
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ghetto
Got kids to feed in the
Ghetto
Sellin coke and weed in the
Ghetto
Everyday somebody bleed in the
Ghetto
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ghetto
If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit, reminisce in bliss on the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em
They tested, it was stressed that they under
We never really went through that
Because we was born B.C. - you and me before crack
And nowadays things changed
Everyone's ashamed of the youth cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reverse
We left them a world that's cursed and it hurts

Don't 'em let me get teary
The world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There is no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
I hope we'll see the light before it's ruined
My Ghetto Gospel
(woman singing)
It's ok, it's ok, it's ok
(2Pac over chorus)
Yeah, my Ghetto Gospel
(Man talking)
(woman singing)
It's ok, it's ok, it's ok
Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Livin' out of bags but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy, well guess she's givin' birth to a baby!
I don't trip to let 'em fade me
From outta the frying pan we jump into another form of slavery
And even now I get discouraged
I wonder if they take it all back will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle (yeah)
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother will be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress and never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
But am I any less holy?
I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
(and this is not world peace, we tried and failed) and there is war on the streets!
My Ghetto Gospel
I remember grandma's hands used to hold me, mold me, I never forget the things she told me
Brothers' a butt and played the big shot, cause you know
Grannies are the only thing that little Ghetto kids got
Moms work and papa's buried
She dropped me over granny's house
Bless her heart cause she worry
And ghetto grannies are like books, we got so many crooks cause so many grannies gettin' shook
And gettin' dropped in the nursing home
And times is hard and even worst alone
And how could you be so cold
You'll get your turn as soon as you turn old
All they ask of every person
Cause everybody needs a little help on the way to relying on one's self
My Ghetto Gospel
I was a stone cold gangsta man
Until you gave me ghetto gospel, I thank you man
Now I'm bangin' these tracks, slanging rhymes I got
In this world of greed tryin' to succeed on my beliefs
Now I lay me down to sleep
Can you forgive me for my sins?
If I had it all to do again, I'd still play to win
I hope the Lord can understand me
A man's gotta do what he can for his family
And pay the price of being hellbound
But I rather see hell later than see hell now
And the devil ain't got nothing on the president, cut back and keep us strapped in our residence and be like animals in cages
We can rant and rave about slavery for ages
Or we can start making positive and hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel
My Ghetto Gospel
(my ghetto gospel)
It's ok, it's ok, it's ok
(my ghetto gospel)
It's ok, it's ok, it's ok
(my ghetto gospel)
(fades)
Haha
For all my niggas in the hood (yeah!)
Livin' the life of a ghetto star
(you know) You know how we do it hahaha
Just holla my name and witness game official
Niggas is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
Witness my enemies die when I ride by
They shouldn't have tried me
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces, they wrists, and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter
Eat a dick, biyotch mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?
Bring it on, forever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
I live the life of a thug nigga, drug dealer livin' game tight
Mug niggas, slug niggas for the fame life
Quick to slang, and let it rain through yo' brain
Movin' niggas with telekinesis
Keepin' Channel 7 at work, filmin' different features
Leadin' niggas to an early death with they head blown
And to those who didn't make it to the morgue was just dead and gone
And hope niggas got punished
Kidnapped, jacked in the back with MAC's to they neck, rappers waitin' to get done in
Back tat at him we tossed his ass out
Printed my name in these streets as a motherfuckin' G
Now the next generation's lookin' up to me like Cedric told em [?]
Walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to my homies that was buried
See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried, forgive me
Please give me shelter, calm my fears
I see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid
Two shots rang from the plastic Glock, wrapped in plastic
Buried the bastard, time to notify
Evacuate the crime scene fast
Fly, I won't touch down 'til I see Tijuana
Set up a shop selling them crooked cops marijuana
Retired from the life that never gave me shit
But cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
Born soldier, fucked 'em up with a MAC-fo'
Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest
Death, apparently they wasn't sucka free
Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggas in protective custody
Thought I was a nerd 'til I bucked one of them to the curb
With a team and clientele on my mothafuckin' dick
By givin' stitches, the life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
When I grow up I wanna be like them
And live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
Live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
And live my life as a ghetto star
This goes out to all you motherfuckers (to all you motherfuckers)
That STILL, have to kill to make that money (still, I'll be puttin' down)
All you niggas on the block, sellin' rocks
Hand to hand, runnin' from the police (sellin' motherfuckin' dopes)
(smokin' weed)
I see you
Live your life as a ghetto star
(look at these tramp ass hoes) Talk to the hood
Claimin' gettin' riches
Runnin' from new playa haters. (any fake ass niggas)
Live my life as a ghetto star
(this is still 70 south)
Niggas with two strikes that don't wanna see the third (nah), I feel you
It's the Don Makaveli - live my life as a ghetto star
The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm taking back what's mine
You motherfuckers can't stop me (laughing)
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
My mama smoked so goddamn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
Don't murder me murder me, kill a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggas in the seven-deuce
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block
Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops
Time to be a ghost
(Hey man, come the fuck on)
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
It's about that time
Check it out
Yeah, bend over
Yeah, yeah, bend over
Yeah, yeah, bend over
Just rollin' (C'mon)
Just rollin' (Ayy what you do?)
Just rollin' (Ayy nigga, what you do?)
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breach through?
‘Cause my momma ain't home
So what you wanna do?
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (But what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this (Sing that shit!)
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
And my money on my mind
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Laid back, with my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be my little nigga's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze, because I'm just…
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
And my money on my mind
Just rollin'!
Laid back, with my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke, shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
But it ain't no stoppin', 'cause I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I get through, I gotta hit the dope spot
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
Laid back, with my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Just rollin'!
Just rollin'!
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
(Death Row)
Say "Dogg Pound"
Say "Dogg Pound"

Say "Snoop Dogg"
(Snoop Dogg)

Say "Gin and Juice"
(Gin and Juice)
Say "Gin and Juice"
(Gin and Juice)
Yeah
Nothin' but a gangsta
Not-nothin' but a gansta (Say what, say what)
Not-not-nothin' but a gansta (Say what, say what)
Not-not-nothin' but a gansta (All of y'all)
Not-not-nothin' but a gansta
Not-not-nothin' but a gansta (Baby!)
Not-not-nothin' but a gansta
Not-not-nothin' but a gansta (Party!)
Yo, we represent to y'all to the fullest
Y'all know we be representin' for y'all
We bringin' it to another level
Nigga shot me five times
I came outta jail and sold five million
Niggas can't fuck with us
That fat fuck only sold two million
He had half of New York rappin' on that shit
That's Death Row style, West side
That peace shit, I ain't even tryna make peace, fuck 'em all
The playas are on this side
That nigga tried to play that gangsta shit but we M-O-B for motherfuckin' real
Then they gonna make a song called "LA, LA"
Them niggas don't know, they gang bang in LA, they love fighting
(Killin' and shootin')
Stupid fucks (Sons of bitches)
That's why we drop it like we drop it
So don't think a nigga be trippin'
We just be tryna represent it for y'all to the fullest
When they say something to us, we wanna make sure we mash they ass
Like we did to Biggie, see that nigga quiet as a fuckin' church mouse
Dropped, hit him up, that nigga quiet as fuck
His wife pregnant, that nigga waitin' like an expecting father
Not knowing who the baby is (Ha, ha, ha)
The world don't know I use the rubber so it ain't mine
Tell you straight
I didn't wanna fuck that fat bitch no way (Just out of spite)
But you know, that's the secret to war
He my enemy, so she looked a'ight
Then they tried to put my nigga on a case for murder and just lock his ass down forever
Like it was kill-a-nigga season
Snoop freaked they ass though, got out not guilty
We gonna drop his shit in a couple of months
So make some noise for Snoop, definitely runnin' for president
(The gangsta party)
Give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC
Give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC, give me a ACC
I was like woah, this nigga must be fucking ecks right up the ass
Because he gave ecks the account goes because that nigga gotta go for begging for a account that had a rare ass name, and these niggas man, this nigga name thai want to fuck with Outlawz, nigga its West Side until i die, ill fuck you up just like 9/11 nigga, Cardboard this is not a diss, its just a fucking message, if you dont listen, then give me a ACC
Cardboard, man im just trying to be friend but
Man fuck yall niggas, just give me a account, and plus thai give me nitro
God
I asked for a friend to help me bear the pain
No one came, except God
When I needed a breath to rise, from my sleep
When all I saw was sadness, and I needed answers
No one heard me, except God
I look for no other name, except God
That's right, bwoy, it's goin' on, right here
Thug Life, God bless the dead
God bless the dead and buried, nigga, don't worry
If you see God first, tell him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you representin' the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers caught up in the whirlwind
We all hoods and all we ever had was dreams
In the gutter you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin', never meant to do time
My epitaph will read "was the last of G's"
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
Ever since I was a little motherfucker wantin' to hang
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin' back in my yearbook
All the years took half my peers, they're stretched for years
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Behind me, life without my 9, I'd rather do the time
And why the hell am I locked in jail?
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin'
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin'
I keep a gun and never run unless I'm comin' at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed too early
Real motherfuckin' G's, this one is for you
Yo Big, this is to you, my nigga
Springfield Hollis Crew, Thug Life, YG'z
Sendin' they respect, ya know what I mean?
You my nigga for life, forever
You're always gonna be with a nigga
No matter what, don't forget that!
I pray before I go to sleep, "Dear God!"
Say my grace before I start to eat, 'cause times is hard
So I'm droppin' to my knees, "Oh why!"
Niggas terrified of drama from the young gun
Hearin' that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind-blowin' so I'm flowin' goin' crazy
Slipped, forgot the gun, but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
But spunk is what he had, kid, I'd rather attack Big
Now you 'bout to smell the aftermath of what the mag did
Wannabe suckas wanna test, I'm tellin' you, yes
The teflon's 'bout to rip through your fuckin' vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick
The spirit Biggy Smallz and the thuggin' clique, yeah
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
Interlude :
You gotta understand that when it was in to have a gun and be in the street, my mother gave that up to be in the house and wash the dishes and feed us and put the thoughts in our brains. Because we didn’t get any of that history from any of those soldiers that we lost--we got none of that. They all went to jail, if you can remember. They all went to penitentiaries
Verse 01 2Pac :
Callin' all dogs and phony rap stars
Uh
Cause I'm convinced that my squad is real
I got a mind that's full of murderous thoughts
When unleashed
I make them niggas bow
Feel me now or be deceased
I ain't choosing sides
Hell no
It's Westside when I ride watch 4 dead bodies
Lyrics are colorful words and anesthetics
Problems are getting worked out faster than calisthenics
I'm bullet proof
Hands on a fully AK so what'chu plan to do
It's West Coast nigga fuck New York
Now did everybody hear me?
You shot at my homies now Imma blast
Screamin' Thug Life muthafucka when I pass
Hook:
NY '87
NY '87
NY '87
NY '87
Dance floor's dangerous
Packed in like a briefcase
Rhyth with ral rough rhyme
Beats with deep bass
Girls with tight pants
Maybe they might dance
The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s grounds are neutral
Now that you're here let me introduce you
Get ready
I'm hard read like graffiti but steady
Science I drop is real heavy
The prescription's one every hour
Ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention: follow directions real close
Keep out of reach of children
Too many milligram
NO ONE made a iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kill a man
Ideas for the ear to fear
Might split 'im
He'll never forget 'im
At least when he left he'll know what hit 'im
The last breath of the words of death
NY '87
2 me your name alone is poetry
I barely know u and already
I can't explain this feeling I feel
4 APRIL
I want 2 c u from the moment
My nonchalant cold heart finally has eyes only
4 APRIL
So now I risk it all
I accept the ridicule
in exchange for the words u share with me
All of this & much more I will do
4 APRIL
Postal border was makin' me mad
So I get up in my cruiser, broke out of the pad
Rolled to the West Side to check out my boys
Twenty brothers in the park, all bringin' the noise
Stepped out the car, Levi's saggin'
Gold around my neck with my limb-walk laggin'
Walked up on my boys with the old E chillin'
The box with the big beats and my boys started illin'
A hoop game started so I jump in
Diz to the outside, 2Pac up the center
A ten minute game and we were the winners
The boys started smackin', talkin' that slack and
Till he see my posse and the suckers started backin'
Another lightweight sucker that can't handle defeat
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not to understand, it's just a day in the life
(2Pac)
Finally I'm on vacation and school is through
So here I am, on Monday mornin' with nothin' to do
So there I lay, for half the day just thinkin'
But I was all alone so it wasn't no thing
Got up to take a shower and heard the phone ring
Picked it up, the salutations, little bit frustrations
Who could be disturbin' me on my vacation?
Speakin' on the phone in an aggravatin' tone
Now I know what Michael meant by leave me alone
It was the voice of my homeboy Roc-T
Had a show at three and now I'm late as can be
Said I have to take a shower, I'll go ahead and take it
If I leave within the hour, I still might make it
I'm rollin' in a sweatsuit, wasn't tryin' to get cute
Hopped on to the stage and said: "Sorry that I kept you"
Couldn't wait to finish so I could start mackin'
Jumped off stage, picked up the girl for the night
Huh, that's how I'm livin', a day in the life, come on
A day in the life
(Ray Tyson)
Stretch white limo hits the colosseum
A crowd full of people sayin: "I can't wait to see 'em"
Who is in the limo, who are they talkin' about?
Strictly Dope in the house, here to turn the party out
We get out the car and can barely stand
Cause everywhere I look are screamin' fans
They'll tear my new clothes if your bodyguards'll let 'em
Hit backstage with two minutes to spare
Just enough time to grip a breath of fresh air
I stepped out on the stage and then I moved the crowd
Winners all over, we tried to leave the scene
Pen and paper in my face, I couldn't be mean
So I was signin' autographs at the age of seventeen
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not hard to understand, it's just a day in the life
Kick it - it's a day in the life
Kick it, kick it, kick it
(2Pac)
Coolin' with my posse at the neighborhood disco
Talkin' to a cutie as I'm sippin' on my cisco
Askin' me to dance but I keep on sayin' "No"
Hate to dance fast, I only like to do it slow
Dizzy's on the dance floor, funky, funky motion
Girl keeps on sweatin' me with sexual kind of totions
Strictly Dope is positive, we're tryin' to stop the violence
Started feel tipsy, I'm lookin' for the door
The Cisco had me dizzy, I stumbled to the floor
My stomach starts to turn and my head feels wit' up
The room begins to spin, I pass out for the night
(Ray Tyson & 2Pac)
Knew I was a genius, soon as you seen this
Avoid ho's value, don't have to redeem this
Teenage terror, no room for error
Risin' like inflation on your favorite station
My mother didn't want me to be, but I'm a emcee
That's why many hate me and call me liar
Hoods of the hype-tip, girls on the ill-trip
I'm through rockin' this whack, so that's it
I am the high type, my style is so right
and your soul was in the wind
It was at this awkward moment
that you and I become friends
and you discovered celibacy
and our bond was a memory
And now I seyou u felt it
that bond we made before
and severs never more
To my niggas that went out in line on duty
21-gun salute! One love, one thug, one nation
(Let’s get down, let’s do this!)
21-gun salute! (Come on, yeah, let’s do this!)
21-gun salute!  (Come on, come on, let’s do this!)
All the time I be…
Hopin' my true motherfuckers know
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
I just appeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas think he live like me
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took five like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed 'em out
Next time grown folks talking, nigga close your mouth!
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall
To let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy, let's be honest: you a punk or you will see me with gloves?
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me bein' a thug?
And you can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with MAC's, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers tryin' to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas lookin' like Larry Holmes (look at De La Soul!)
Flabby and sick
Tryin' to player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known, this is how you made me
Against all odds, hopin' my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
I heard he was light-skinned, stocky, with a Haitian accent
Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashin'
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was workin' for the feds
Same crime, different trials, nigga, picture what he said
And did I mention?
Promised to payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listenin', the world is mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Play the game, nigga; all out warfare, eye for eye
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots to Tut, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga, this M.O.B
So believe me, we enemies, I go against all odds
I'm hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
I'm hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote; against all odds
Puffy gettin' robbed like a bitch, to hide that fact
And that nigga that was down for me, restin' dead
Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin' or dead
Lord, listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written
You heard my melody (This nigga sounds like Rakim!)
Now you wanna live my life
So what's a "chazzer," Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right
You've seen too many movies
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die — goodbye!
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me? Nigga
Hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
Against all odds, hopin' my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke; against all odds
21-gun salute, one love to my true thug niggas
(Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)
21-gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty
That play the rules of the game, 21-gun salute
I salute you, my niggas, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all you bitch-made niggas, I'm comin' for you
Against all odds, I don't care who the fuck you is
You touch me, I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers didn't think I forgot
Hell nah, I ain't forgot, nigga
You said don't go to war unless I got my money right
I got my money right now, now I want war
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Preoccupied with my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'
That's right, that's right boy, start that shit off
I heard a rumor I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Where I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watchin' for thievin', I'm cautious, it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin' a bullet in motherfuckers, give me da reason
You tried to play me, now homicide's my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G?
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Preoccupied with my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
Motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'
I got my locs on, hard hat, goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
And get to dumpin' on they ass like the last outlaw
Rich, 2Pac and The Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick
I'm fully automatic, full of static and shit
I'm ridin' shotgun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, and weed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker, I ain't hard to find
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Preoccupied with my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'
C-Bo, D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
Da Bay, beitch!
Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal weapons they carry, can't be scary
Best shake and bake all them I-was-finst-to-ass niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him, have at him
(Check this out)
I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double agent for the other side
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
More than twenty stitches, you behave like them bitches
Sideways to the next
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find
What we missin'? Y'all don't know what we missin'?
What we missin'?
Pooh, hit 'em in they head
Yeah, yeah
(Give it up, it's a party in this motherfucker)
(It's a party in this motherfucker)
It's a party y'all
Wave your hands from side to side, c'mon
To the left, to the right
Wave your hands from side to side
When I met you last night, baby
Before you opened up your gap
But now I take it all back
('Cause yous a trick-ass bitch)
And you even licked my balls
And I promise baby, I'll give you a call (Maybe)
Next time I'm feeling kinda horny (Biatch)
You can come on over (Ya know, ya know)
And I'll break you off (Everybody, everybody, c'mon)
And if you can't fuck that day baby (Sing that shit)
Just lay back and open your mouth
(Throw it up y'all, throw it up y'all, ain't no fun if my homies can't have none, throw i up)
That I love in the whole wide world
(Oh shit, Kurupt the king)
Well if Kurupt gave a fuck about a bitch I'd always be broke
I'd never have no motherfucking (Indo to smoke)
I gets loc'ed and loony
Bitch you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie
I have no love for hoes
That's something that I learned in Tha Pound
To pay this ho just to lay this ho
I know the pussy's mine
So I'mma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothing else to do with it
Pass it to the homie, now you hit it
And y'all know that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt hoe
You'll never be my only one, trick ass bitch
(C'mon, everybody sing that shit)
(Up top, it don't stop)
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
(C'mon, sing that shit)
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Guess who back in the motherfucking house
Hoes recognize, niggas do too
What you gon' do?
You really don't know
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing damn well I'm too caught up with my grip
Now as the sun rotates and my game grows bigger
How many bitches wanna fuck this nigga named Snoop
Doggy, I'm all the above
I'm too swift on my toes to get caught up with you hoes
If my homies can't get a taste of it
Uh, uh
I just don't love it man
Something to keep your confidence up
Hey, yo this going out to Mu grandmother
Definitely going out to Mu's grandmother
One love, rest in peace, let the angels take you
One love
Ain't nothin' wrong with a nigga gettin' his papers
Don't hate us, listen to the song
Still waitin' on the world to come save us
How they made us, every time it's on
No matter who did it they blame us, they hate us
They hate us
Ain't nothin' wrong with a nigga gettin' his papers
Don't hate us, listen to the song
Still waitin' on the world to come save us
How they made us, every time it's on
No matter who did it they blame us, they hate us
Gotta be strong, no matter what they do they can't break us
Cuz they hate us
Verse continues to repeat throughout song
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
There's, never a good day
My homies dyin' 'fore they get to see they birthdays
Sometimes it hurts to pray
And every Halloween
Check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
Sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
And if it does
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise
So keep ya head up
Pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
So keep ya head up
And make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day...
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
Wish right now, wish right now
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
And would've tried, but when I held that 9
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
I got a spot for us all so we can ball, at thug's mansion
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone, they're just memories
Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
"Marshall you're never gonna make it
Pretend he just stayed outside all day
And played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move
And schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums
And just lazy as shit
"You won't amount to shit, quit daydreamin', kid!
You need to get your cranium checked
You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic"
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him
But he didn't make it to the Rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
But it didn't fall in his lap
So he ain't even here, he pretends that…
I could really use a wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
Wish right now, wish right now
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga! I’m comin'!
Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you (It's all about you) (This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac, you know what I'm sayin'?)
It's all about you (Yeah, I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, ha! Yeah)
Want to laugh 'bout how I got my ass
Caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us kissin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, ‘cause this is all about you
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Yeah, nigga
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
I'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit
I mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?
What make that even more fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video!
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same ho
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah
So I'm a lil’ bit tired
I ain't get to rehearse this shit
So we doing it all live
Hey Suge, what I tell you when I come out of jail what I was gonna do? I was gonna start diggin into these niggas checks right? And quick, lemme see them binoculars. The binoculars
C'mon, yeah!
It’s all about you, one time
It's all about you
Turn it up, turn it up!
It's all about you
Want to laugh 'bout how I got my ass
Caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Scandalous times, this game’s like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin’ for some love
In every club, I see you watchin' like you want it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin’ you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us fucking', can I get it?
Addicted to the things you do
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, ‘cause this is all about you
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Yeah, nigga
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I love niggas ‘cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Now I never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
Uh, uh
It's like that
It's all about you
Where "How Do You Want It" at yo?
How do you want it?
Where that freaky shit?
How does it feel?
our paths crossed and met
that u would be hard 2 4get
but you reeked of sultry confidence
I couldn't wait 2 touch lips
when we did it was what I expected
and 4 that moment we erased the tension
of the awkwardness of First Date Jitters
we kissed again and I felt the passion
Change? Shit
I guess change is good for any of us
(C'mon) Yeah!
Where my ladies at? Where my ladies?
It's all about you
(Turn it up, turn it up)
Turn that shit up man!
(Fuck that shit!)
Not the mic!
You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh 'bout how I got my ass
Caught up with this bad bitch?
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
Well that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us kissin', can I kick it?
Addicted to the things you do
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
C'mon G
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas ‘cause we comin' from the same place
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show

Now I don't put a bitch before my friends, so here we go

It's all about you
You, you, you, you
And you, and you
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
(This for some of the niggas too)
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll

At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
Uh, uh
It's like that
And, and
It's all about you, one time!
(I'ma say it's all about you, baby, yeah!)
It's all about you! (This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac, you know what I'm sayin'?)
It's all about you
(Yeah, I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, hah! Yeah)
Want to laugh about how I got my ass caught up
With this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug

Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, ‘cause this is all about you
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho'
Every other city we go, every other video

Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ho'
I see you struttin' in your miniskirt
A crooked smile with a heart that did plenty dirt
Will it work with your ass as you pass me by?
Sayin' "hey," I've been looking at you smile all day, let's parlay
While I keep workin' on your zipper, my tongue kissin'
In your position I'm fortified to do the mission
Move your hips and groove to this
Too many cooks in the kitchen, nobody take the time to listen
They probably think we still dissin'
Wit' your permission, I can make you scream my name
I'm a real man, guide you through the sleazy game
Follow me, let me take you to the ecstasy
You'll have the time of your life when you next to me you'll see
Ain't no way they can stop me
When I know a true thug woman got me
It's all about you
Big Syke, Newt, Hank, Beauregard, Big Sur (yeah)
Y'all know how this shit go (you know)
All eyes on me
Roll up in the club and shit, is that right?
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
But you know what?
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when I'm high
'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings
Uhh, bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
We got four niggas in low riders and ski masks
Screamin', "Thug Life" every time they pass, all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player (All eyes on me) 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money
Motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it; all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Pay attention, my niggas! See how that shit go?
Nigga walk up in this motherfucker and it be like, "Bing!"
Cops, bitches, every-motherfuckin'-body
(Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)
(I live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)
(Livin' life as a boss playa, 'cause even gettin' high)
He he he, it's like what they think
I'm walkin' around with some ki's in my pocket or somethin'
They think I'm goin' back to jail, they really on that dope
(Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)
(Live my life as a boss playa)
I know y'all watchin', I know y'all got me in the scopes
(Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)
Y'all got me under surveillance, huh?
All eyes on me, but I'm knowin'
Big Syke, Newt, Hank, Beugard, Big Sur
Y'all know how this shit go
All eyes on me
Motherfuckin' OG
Roll up in the club and shit, is that right?
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
A five-double-oh Benz, flauntin' flashy rings, uh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas in low riders and ski masks
Screamin', "Thug Life" every time they pass, all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
(Heeyyy, to my nigga 'Pac)
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high

All eyes on me
Pay attention, my niggas! See how that shit go?
Nigga walk up in this motherfucker and it be like, "Bing!"
Cops, bitches, every-motherfuckin'-body
(Live my life as a boss playa, 'cause even gettin' high)
I got bustas, hoes, and police watchin' a nigga, you know?
(I live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)
(Livin' life as a boss playa, 'cause even gettin' high)
He he he, it's like what they think
I'm walkin' around with some ki's in my pocket or somethin'
They think I'm goin' back to jail, they really on that dope...
We goin' all out, we goin' all out
We goin' all out
Watch your motherfuckin' mouth, niggas!
(That's right, fuck these fag niggas!)
Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Outlaw 'til it's over, brandish my strap, back like a cobra
I stay drunk ‘cause I'm a mad man whenever sober
On a one-man mission, my ambition's to hold up
The rap game, while I pluck holes in niggas like donuts
And still down to die for all my soldiers like hillbillies
They don't fear me, so we feud, bringin' war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, Your Honor
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit, heavily armed
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of 30 niggas who all got me
While bitches wonderin' who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin' slugs like Muammar Gaddafi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga, like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me, another gay rapper
Bustin' caps at Jay Z and still avoid capture (Buck buck buck buck)
While y'all caught up in the rapture, still after me
We used to havin' nothin' then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasn't
Niggas player-hatin', got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screamin' "Death Row!", throw my Westside, ain't no thing
We was raised off drive-by's, brought up to bang
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this: I'm hard to kill when I peel with this live spot
Father, how the Hell did I survive these five shots?
Live it up or give it up and like demons
Late night, hear them screamin', "We goin' all out!"
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out
I'm on my last leg, walkin' through the belly of the beast
Feelin' like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, that we mob niggas hidin' in bushes
Claimin' that they ride rough, but they softer than cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin' in blood
Outlawz, my blood brothers, I'd die for these thugs
Say hi to this slug
It's a shame how some niggas on the West Coast
I'm out in Jers, to the fullest, like some West Coast love
But after 'Pac stopped rappin', it ain't no West Coast thug
Just West Coast, slut, to my real niggas stuck in the street game
‘Cause rappers like Jay Z be pumpin' Kool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what I'm sayin'? Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo'-fo' put peek holes through your door
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Now, we all ride, and down to die — who with us?
They ain’t nothin' but squealers
In this rap game, swearin' they rough
Tattooed up, and now them niggas swearin' they 'Pac
Stop that, and watch your back, we ain't forgot 'bout ya
These Glocks hot, and when shot it'll bring the bitch up out ya
It's me, Kastro with the goattee, walkin' like a OG
‘Cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
I pray to thug lords like them motherfuckers holy
I go all out, and if you real, you real
Feel what I'm talkin' 'bout, ‘cause this game is ill
I live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'til they feel it
Livin' proof, Pac breed niggas they can't deal with
Or get blood in it, what! We goin' all out, nigga!
We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out
Fool, you better go all out
Keep goin' all out
All my niggas goin' all out
Without a muthafuckin' doubt
Aye, you niggas just gon' think you gon' be uhh
Talkin' slick on all of these motherfuckin' records
And we ain't gon say shit
Don't disrespect the Don
It's still war, motherfuckers
So let's see you act like you know
What of a love unspoken? Is it weaker without a name?
because I dare not share its name
Does that make me cruel and cold
2 deny the world of my salvation
Why shouldn't I be weary
and withhold this love from MAN
What of a love unspoken
no one ever knows
But this is a love that lasts
and in secrecy it grows
Learn from their misfortune
Learn from their pain
Believe in something
Believe in yourself
Turn adversity into ambition
Now blossom into wealth
I won't deny it I'm a straight rider
Ain't no stopping me
So why you suckers keep boxing me?
Wanna see me cuffed up and call the cops on me
On a mission to be champs since they let me free
Ain't no stopping me
So why you suckers keep boxing me?
Wanna see me cuffed up, call the cops on me
On a mission to be champs they let me free
Prepare for combat my adversaries crumble
Face it I got a reputation for damage busters get ready to rumble
They lock me in a cell had me trapped in a livin' hell
Though not guilty I'm still in jail
Brother I serve my time like a soldier
Maintain composure
My shadow boxing I fight to the death bustin' boulders
Best give up love
To shake the world with the flurry of my black fist
Now I'm the million dollar champ who's the next to get knocked out
Straight out of Brooklyn I'm world wide y'all all know me
Droppin' all that come before me
No one can hold me
And uh
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
Ain't no stoppin' me
So why these suckers keep boxin' me
Wanna see me cuffed up, call the cops on me
On a mission to be champs since they let me free
I'm a straight rider
Ain't no stoppin' me
So why you suckers keep boxin' me
Wanna see me cuffed up, call the cops on me
On a mission to be champ since they let me free
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
Ain't no stoppin' me
Wanna see me cuffed up, call the cops on me
On a mission to be champ since they let me free
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
Next heavy weight champion of the world
Mike Tyson
Go 'head nigga
Get back to the top of where you supposed to be at!
These suckers don't know how to throw them thangs boy
You a legend
You a legend!
You be boxin' for the homies
We ain't got nothin' but love for ya
Stay ridin' homie
Stay ridin'
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Not bitches over money
My ambitions as a ridah
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was "fuck it," 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, ho!"
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)
It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the .9
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
But they can't do nothin' to a G
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Oh, 2Pac is performing now
Ooh, that ass girl

But I got dibs at the hotel afterwards
His body though!

To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Uh-huh-huh, and my ambitions as a ridah
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, ho!"
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
Me, Syke and Bogart wrap it up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Nah, Now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

You don't wanna...
Just when I thought I'd seen it all
our paths crossed and met
that u would be hard 2 4get
I couldn't wait 2 touch lips
and kiss with my Heart's intentions
when we did it was what I expected
of the awkwardness of First Date Jitters
and the initials Blind Date First impressions
we kissed again and I felt the passion
and This was CUPID'S Blessing
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
Got the police bustin' at me
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me

But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
They wanna bury me I'm worried
I'm losin' my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine
And my vision's blurry
Fallin' to pieces, am I guilty?
I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me unfortunately 'cause I'm guilty
I'm chokin' off Marijuana smoke
With every toke it's like I'm losin' focus
Fallin' to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin', and goin' nutty
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin' funny
Flashbacks of bustin caps, anything for money
Where am I goin' I discovered can't nothin' save me
My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
While I'm in bed, leakin' blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller?
Gettin' suspicious of this bitch the line's busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin' all her homies
That I can fuck her like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
I drink a fifth of Hennessy, I don't think it's healthy
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm losin' homies, ain't that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?
Then tell me am I lost 'cause I'm lonely?
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin'
They wonder if I'm hellbound
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
Ayo are you afraid to die?
Tell me which one?
Hahahaha
I ain't scared to die
* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists
Whattup 'Pac?
This for my dog, 2Pac Shakur, 2Pac Shakur
Yeah
Today is filled with anger
Fueled with hidden hate (fueled with hidden hate)
Scared of bein outcast (scared of bein outcast, scared of being an outcast)
Afraid of common fate (afraid of common fate)
Today is built on tragedy (today, is built on tragedy)
Which no one wants to face, which no one wants to face
Nightmares to humanity (nightmares, to humanity)
And morally disgraces (and morallyyyyyyyyy disgraced)
A chance to build anew
Tomorrow, I see change (chaaaaaaange)
A chance to build anew
Today is filled with rage, violence fills the air
Today I lay my head down, but the pressure never stops
Gnawin at my sanity, content when I am dropped
But tomorrow, I see change...
Tomorrow, I see change (but tomorrow, I see change)
A chance to build anew
Built on spirit, content of heart
And ideals based on truth
And tomorrow's the same way
I'm strong, because of my pride
To know I fought with all my heart
To keep my dreams alive
And tomorrow (heyyyyyyyyyyyyyeahhhheyy)
Tomorrow (ooooooooh tomorrow tomorrow...)
Today is filled with anger
Fueled with hidden hate
Afraid of common fate
Today is built on tragedies
which no one wants 2 face
Nightmares 2 humanities
and morally disgraced
Tonight is filled with rage
Violence in the air
Children bred with ruthlessness
Because no one at home cares
But the pressure never stops
gnawing at my sanity
content when I am dropped
But 2morrow I c change
A chance 2 build anew
and ideals based on truth
And 2morrow I wake with second wind
2 know I fought with all my heart 2 keep my dream alive
Love, love, oh no! (oh yeah)
This one is for my baby boo (thats you)
Now whats about baby (thats right)

I wish you know how much I cared
You'd see my love is true, that love we'd share (of course!)

As a matter of fact I don't have anything,
except a dream of a better day
And you, to help me find my way
Being a man I am sure to make mistakes
But to keep you, I would do all it takes
and if it meant my love was really true
I'd gladly die and watch over you
I wish you knew how much I cared
You'd see my love is true. By the life we'd share
Even if you changed your mind and said our love was thru
I'd want to die, continuously cry and still I'd love you
Conjunction junction, what's my function?
I'm workin' up tracks to tap niggas that function
It's the motherfucking gangsta from around the way (Hey)
The one that brings you styles on timesy-wimesy
Conduction, construction when I bust
Because I got to bust off of the top of the H-E-A-D
It's a must with my nigga Richie Rich and 2Pac
It's Warren G, yo, I got a cliggy-clock
Ends with my nigga SN double O P
D O double G, Y D O double to the G
Let me come back 'cause I'm like this, see
The LB to the motherfuckin' gangsta C
Don't trip off me, bro
Let me just kick a motherfucka 'cause I flow for my homie
Well, I can take one two and let you know that it be hype
Standin' up finna shoot the shot to young Syke
What you wanna do is throw your flow to let 'em know
When it's comin' R-F-E double E, though (Woo)
One time for the camera, Richard's come to slam ya
Pickin' out your hat, yeah, Georgetown's phat
With the bulldog, ooh wee, why's he wanna do me?
'Cause uhh if a nigga he tries to play ya
Although he's telling your kid like he's a playa but
Don't bang, hang don't it
What you wanna do is get away from in front of me
And I'll be pickin' up the slack
It's thug 2Pacalypse now to grab the gat and rip the track
Ain't a damn thing funny, work me up, sonny
I be like calm in my business, time to hit that shit
I'm rippin' up the track 'cause I be down with the clique
And all my niggas in the house we hella drunk
It's time to get our drink on, nigga
And smoke lots of dank and uh
Bitches be catchin' vapors and uhh
Clinton couldn't fuckin' save us
And it's all in 'cause niggas be ballin'
I drive a fuckin' Benz 'cause I'm all in
And don't be havin' friends
That's why we made this fuckin' jam animosity
I won't quit, I talk a lot of shit
But niggas don't wanna slang 'em 'cause I bring 'em
I be, 165 but I'm high 'til I fuckin' die
So you what you wanna do? Bring your whole fuckin' crew
And my Glock'll have them niggas runnin' up the block
My nigga Syke, he do what the fuck he like
And he's next on the mic, so won't you hit these niggas hella high
Never again will I ever trust a bitch
You can get that ass if they think you rich
Hungry bitches I can spot 'em a mile away
They get nice when it's close to they birthday
All of you do is hang around and stay down
And don't try to front, you fuckin' clown
'Cause your woman is fine but she ain't yours
'Cause she creepin' through my motherfuckin' back door
It feels good the way I make her moan
'Cause she don't get served like this at home
If I keep her too late, she might get in trouble
You think highly but I got to bust your bubble
She bragged to her friends, so I fucked her crew
'Cause I'm single when a gangsta got to mingle
And while I was stabbin' it, ooh, it tingle
I'ma leave 'em, I'ma leave 'em, yeah I can see
Like being with me, that's my change
But you cookie hungry hoes would stay saved
So let a bitch be a bitch, and a ho be a ho
'Cause if you blaze and roll, you will never know
So never again, never again
So don't get a woman, just have friends
{*singing in other language*}
When your hero falls from grace, all fairy tales are uncovered
Myth exposed and pain magnified, the grace pays uncovered
He told me to be strong, but I confused to see you so weak
You say never to give up, and it hurts to see you welcome defeat
When your hero falls so league the stars, and so does the perception of tomorrow
Without my hero, there's only me alone, to deal with my sorrow
What are you expected to do, when your only hero falls
As long as some suffer, the river flows forever
As long as there is pain, the river flows forever
As strong as a smile can be, the river will flow forever
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together..
..And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together
We'll ride.. the river together, as long as.. you are with me
The river.. will flow forever, as long as.. you are with me
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin' like that?
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs
Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
"Free 2Pac" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Now give me fifty feet
And keep whatever's left of me
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
My nigga Dogg wit' me, eternally the most wanted
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Bitch! Where you at? Where you at?
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Yeah, Death Row
As long as some suffer
The River Flows Forever
As long as there is pain
The River Flows Forever
As strong as a smile can be
The River Will Flow Forever
And as long as u R with me
we'll ride the River Together
As the world turns…
As the world turns my niggas grow and grow and grow
And get dough and roll and ride
Niggas die and mommas cry
Niggas got alibis and suicides and homicides
And three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggas fame, as the world turns…
Though I walk through the valley of Hell the shadow follows me. Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow, expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
And still stranded. Merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change
If we search deeper
God bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
When we ride, plots keep all my enemies blinded
Like last year, niggas stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the mob, M.O.B
Lyrically fatally driven, niggas reported missin'
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turns…
Turns, turns, turns, turns and turns
My niggas grow and grow and grow
(As The World Turns)
Gettin' dough and dough and dough
From this state to that state
Yo Pac Cover Me, I'm in this thang for the luxury
Wassup with me I'm fuckin' chilling, Dreams of millions (Ya moms in this Bitch)
Time to keep my green buildings, maintained with no fillings
New street geek plucka', a long wrap without a rubba'
Listen to my Bompton, Outlaw blast the Compton, Gettin' half in pumpin (Jersey in this bitch)
I cluck the razor slap it chocolate, Hey Now
Move it down like Emmett, only five minutes in it
Got my town extended, Sadam Hussan
A Big San, San Wan, I'm the first the bomb
Dear Mama I disrespected ways to your vagina
Household de-ca, when the cops was behind ya'
Some niggas got crippled, money still gettin' tripled
Suckers'll stick you, I keep my hands on the pistol
Fake teardrops, real closed casket they got it mastered
Unprofessionally, I crawl with aggressional
Thoughts me and my gats, climbs apps like a sexual
For this pain and agony, I feel allegated gravity
And my heart hurt, like I got voodoo pins stabbin' me
(Ooh, shit)
Rest in Peace Soldier (Rest in Peace Soldier)
Haha
As The World Turns
(And my niggas roll by, hahaha)
As The World Turns
(Niggas get a swoll eye, and it don't stop and it don't quit
As The World Turns
(Niggas die for this, How many you niggas try to this?)
As The World Turns
(Murderin' methods.. haha, OUTLAW!)
Only haters caught feelings when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin'
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin' our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas – mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin', armies ridin', soldiers born wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now, as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nothin' left to earn
October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my MAC-11 hit the block playin'
Only five years up in this bitch, papa runnin' from the feds
Puttin' peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown, but only man of the home
To protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin' straight shots of Cristal Brothers
100 dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin' pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
Aye-yo! (As The World Turns)
Who gettin' money, REAL G's nigga!
Fuck that lil' five hundred ten dollar shit that lil' hundred dollar shit
I'm talkin' bout brand new creep
BLACK JESUS, I know he sees and only he can feed us
I believe you, you believe us
Only leaders no followers
(Haha), my .44 GO, Four-Four, and they drop
When a nigga picture all you using a cop (Haha)
Anybody that try to stop me take me off this planet I can't STAND you trick ass niggas if you try to ban this here
Have no fear The Outlawz have come nigga disappear when we run (Bitch ass)
When we come when we ride
Suicides and homicides is what we supply
Niggas die don't cry now (As The World Turns)
What you found, niggas from the pound, three fifty-seven, all the way to heaven (Haha)
My MAC-11 keep these niggas breathin', who do you believe in?
Only he can see us, BLACK JESUS
Haha, Yes, YES, As The World Turns (As The World Turns)
Death Row, Haha
No doubt, Lil' Napoleon is this Bi-yatch
With a big ass four-five bigger than him (Haha)
Niggas don't want it (Outlawz Nigga)
WESTSIDE, Nigga, We got Jersey
We got the Bay to LA, Best Side
Westside (Y'all know what time it is)
When you close your eyes and wake up in the morning
I feel ya.. baby don’t…
Baby don’t cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don’t cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Uh
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin’ quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me
“What would you do if it was you?”
Couldn’t answer such a horrible pain to live through
I couldn’t picture three crazed niggas grabbin’ me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain
Four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn’t me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin’ with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
Baby please don’t cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don’t cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don’t cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don’t cry
You all a bunch of f*ckin' a*sholes
You know why?
You need people like me so you can point your f*cking fingers
And say "That's the bad guy."
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressing keep a vest for protection
From the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my n*ggas in the pen, here we go again
Straight solider, bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try, n*ggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, than we multiply
See me striking down the block hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherf*cker, living like I wanna
Ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherf*cker, crime pays
Zig-zagging through the freeway
The realest motherf*cker that you ever saw
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You all a bunch off f*cking a*sholes)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
(You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You need people like me..)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
(So you can point your f*ckig fingers and say "That's the BAD GUY.")
Ain't no escape from a deadly fate
And everyday there's a million black bodies put away
Sometimes I choke on the indo, creeping out the window
Got no love from the household
I'm out cold, on the streets screaming "Motherf*ck peace!"
Live the THUG LIFE, n*gga stay true
I wonder when they kill me, is there a heaven for a real G?
Lord forgive me, if you feel me
Cause all my life I was dirt broke with no hope
Little skinny motherf*cker wanting dough
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade
But everyday it's a struggle to get major paid
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
(You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You need people like me..)
(So you can point your f*ckig fingers and say "That's the BAD GUY.")
The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
The poverty bothers me, but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
Listen! I can hear her crying in the bedroom
Praying for money but never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else
Can I blame daddy cause he left me?
So my mama don't love me on my own at a early age
I'm getting paid
And I'm strapped, so I'll never be afraid
Can't turn back, my eyes on the prize
I got nothing to lose (I got nothing to lose)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
Everybody gotta die..
(You all a bunch off f*cking a*sholes)
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
(You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be)
Everybody gotta die..
Say goodbye to the BAD GUY
(So you can point your f*ckig fingers and say "That's the BAD GUY.")
Yeah, ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dogs, official mob figures
Love to act up, the first to bomb when we rob niggas
I can be lost in my own mind
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennessy
Talkin' to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin' "Fuck the police!" as I ride through the night streets
Little child runnin' wild, towards danger
What's the cause? Don't be alarmed, death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
Promise a merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for Life, I will be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It's a crazy world full of sin
Close your eyes…
Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switched, now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin', "Bloody murder, murder!"
A blind man and a dead body, I'm ready to leave town
Homie had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back
Upon my secret arrival
Two Glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals – tell me, what you want, Lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord
The situation's critical, nothin' is colder
Than hear the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for Life, I will be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It's a crazy world full of sin
Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
So merciless, I'm terrifyin' niggas in my ballads
Do you feel me? Capo or Capi-tan
One day I'll be the Don; until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggas facin' 60 years
Takin' private planes, tryin' to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All they promise us is death, nigga
Take a breath, come be the last one left, nigga
It's real now, feel it or fantasize it, ain't nothin' colder
Listen, you can hear it – the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for Life, I will be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It's a crazy world full of sin
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier
This go out to Kato, Mental, all the niggas that passed away
Mutulu, Geronimo, Seyku – all the down-ass riders
All the niggas that put it down, all the soldiers
All the niggas that go through that day-to-day struggle
(This is the ballad of a dead soldier!)
All the niggas that passed on
All the niggas with ambition and money in they heart
All the niggas that want some and that don't take none
Hahaha (It's the ballad of a dead soldier!)
The police are so scared of us
They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga head, (Ballad of a dead soldier!)
Tryin' to see me in chains, shit
Them niggas'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell, they'll see me in Hell
(‘Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!)
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole motherfuckin' block; fuck the cops!
The police? We run these streets, nigga
(Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!)
These niggas can't see me, half the world wanna be me
But nigga, you know – it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
'96 sho' shot
'96 sho' shot
And you sitting down in a chair, won't you ditch hole big black booty, get up
Shake it like you just don't care
Just shake it like you just don't care
We down to mash with a ski mask down your face
Prolly be classic I laugh at they fake ass as a prank
But they don't wanna get they ass kicked
My competitions runnin' til they last
Never get they casket played
And drunk folks living learn the truth
Boo don't trust your friends, niggas turn on you
True get your buzz on..
Better days, hey
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey
Better days
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin' weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids
Wanna try now, then lie down and get ran through
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
‘Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same, too many murders
Too many funerals, and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried, plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days
Better days, better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Hey
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Thinkin' back as an adolescent, who woulda guessed
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Tryna keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin' yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
And so am I — I can't take her to the places she wanna go to
So, we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin' passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend
So many blessings while we stressin', lookin' for them better days (for better days)
Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
Now, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Affiliated with gang-bangers and still made it
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
Out in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks
Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell
Doin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail
And me, I'm doin' cool
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And I wonder how we ever came to this; I miss the better days
Hey, better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Hey
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days
I send this one out to all the homeboys down in, uh
Clinton lockdown, Rikers Island
All them dudes I was, uh, locked up with, hehe
E Block, F Block, lower H
N-I-C in Rikers Island, downstate
All the peoples I met along the way
You ain’t lyin to me, who dat
O.F.T.B. up in this bitch
Better days, heyy, better days
Got me thinkin’ bout better days
Better days,  better days, better days, heyy, better days
Got me thinkin’ bout better days
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin weed like it ain’t no thang, so even kids
Wanna try now, they lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches the clockin’ the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin victims screamin’
Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
I’d love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
It’s up to us to clean up the streets, it ain’t the same
Too many murders, too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say
Keep yo’ head up and try to keep the faith
Better dayz, better days, better days, heyyy
Heyy, it seems like yesterday, I used to play
Around the way, those were the better dayz
Growin up as a child carefree
Mama said I was wild by 3
Even pops showed me love he was there
I remember hangin out playin truth or dare
We didn’t have much so we made the best of
What we could afford but we had love
Tryna be grown might sneak and curse
One T.V. set got, to cut it on the first
Back in the good times and the Jeffersons
Those are the days I miss and reminisce
So I steady wish..
Down memory lane, I walk and stalked the streets
It’s ’96 ain’t nothing change but the years
I shedded some tears, I had it up to here
See I want something more in life
3 strikes ain’t no joke, these white folks
Got us on the tight rope
Knowin we down to fall
Us niggas we ball, we want it all
Kill each other over somethin small
It’s time to wake up, yo I’m callin all those
That want to listen, take a look around
Observe your position, do you like what you see
Poverty and frustration, aggravation, temptation
They bought a bottle posse mo’termination
They kept the real and keep it real
That’s why I say, heyy
Got me thinkin bout better dayz
Better days, better days, better days, heyyy
Better days, better days
Got me thinkin’ bout better days
It’s mad to get out of the ghetto and get some
And when you get it, don’t forget where you came from
Sleepin with the enemy, livin on they block
A kingpin from the slums, ain't that about nuttin
They can’t stand to see a black man havin somethin
Stereotype, television got em twisted
Check the statistics, black folks with businesses
Legitimate investments, yea we comin up
And they scared of us, for many years they mistreated us
Beaten us, left us swingin from the rope
Now ask yaself who’s supplyin the dope
Now when we do it, Armageddon come
Are they willin to die for they unlawful acts
It’ll take a nation of million to hold us back
It’s time for a homie reuinion
We gotta stop meetin at these muthafuckin funerals
So we can all live and see better days, dayyys
Thinkin bout better days
Better days, better days, better days, heyyy
Better days, better days
Got me thinkin’ bout better days
That goes to slang
Waitin on the day for us to overcome
All the obstacles set forth to keep us dumb
Everybody got a destiny they gotta control
Spend your life behind bars and the rest on parole
We know nobody gives a fuck about the boys on the bottom
Wanna see us in a cell somewhere, where you can rot
Survival is a must so I kill to survive
I see moms on her knees every night she prays
Better days
Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin, what am I tryin for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin to get in my P's
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a ho into a housewife, baby, and there you go
There you there you go, actin like a ho
Actin like a ho, actin like a ho
HOE! See the word on the streets you're a
HOE! Just a groupie on a world tour
HOE! Now I found out for myself you're a
These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim 'em, just bang 'em
Papa raised a player, so player, I play 'em
And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin too much
When she be dyin to fuck me you be buyin her stuff, ho
See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin clown after clown, town coast to coast - see
I been tryin to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin like H20 it ain't nuthin for me to say
Why you keep actin like a ho? But there you go
Yeah, c'mon
(My bad)
Put your hands in the air!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
My dick kinda limp so I cruise around the block
Call my cousin Snoop as I swoop in the Coupe
Stop by my homey Dru house to puff on the loop
Damn near gone, floatin' on cloud one-nine
Liquor store, so I grab some mixed gin and juice
Got a quarter pound of bud so I'm fucked up too
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
Bailed back in the crib (For what?) Because I'm all-in
Conversated then I dug that hoe out
I fixed me some food, then boned the hell out, and said
Tomorrow, tomorrow, check it out
Here we go and we'll be back to dick you out
G's up, hoes down
If she can't swim, she's bound to drown
Two A.M. on the dizot, I pause and I stizop
I reminisce on that ass that I rizzocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Four A.M. as I stoll back to my crib
To see what's with my woman and my newborn kid
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this everyday about the same time, beyotch!
I was at the park one day, that's when I saw her face
She looked kind of cavi to me
(Don't stop, c'mon)
But when I take her home, and tap that ass I'm gone
I'm just a dog, don't blame me
Yeah
Now do I love them hoes? (Hell nah!)
And why is that? (Because you're Snoop Doggy Dogg
And you never gave a fuck about a bitch
'Cause to you, bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks)
Ha ha, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds from my nigga Doggy Dogg
Slidin' through the city in the rag six-fo'
Hittin' all the spots but I'm comin' up blank
Parks my ride as I, steps inside, as I
Puts my nine double-M to my side, as I
Continue with my mission
Pussy is my dish and I'm fishin', wishin'
Upon a star, to come up on some ends
So I can get my pimp on
'Cause my pen gets my pimp on from G to ozone
Tell your friends bitch
All your friends bitch
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party
Ain’t nothin but a gansta party
Ain't nothin but a gansta party
Uh, picture-perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the suckas with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin’ homie
Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
"Free 2Pac" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin’ cases
Me and Snoop about to clown
I’m losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
Niggas be actin’ like they savage, I'm out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' savage
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these West Coast G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party, party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Give me fifty feet
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is envious, sufferin' is greed
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
It's like Cuzz, Blood gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
They say we live by the strap, we die by the strap, kids
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted
Now do the gangsters run this motherfucker? (Hell Yeah)
Now do the gangsters run this motherfucker? (Hell Yeah)
Now do the ladies run this motherfucker? (Hell Yeah)
West Side is motherfuckin' right here
West Side is motherfuckin' right here
West Side is motherfuckin' right here
West Side is motherfuckin' right here
West Side is motherfuckin' right here
West Side is motherfuckin' right here
West Side is motherfuckin' right here
Outlawz is motherfuckin' right here
Death Row!
Death Row in this motherfucker
West Side!
The West Side!
Peace!
Bad Boy killers in the house
Mobb Deep killers in the house
What y'all niggas know about Coco No
Nothin' but a gangsta party
Let the house loose
Doggy style up in this motherfucker
Thug life, microphone check
Where you bitch niggas coming from?
I can hear your style, sounds like Makaveli The Don
2Pac, my nigga
So much trouble in the world nigga
These niggas can't feel your pain
Thug life, outlaw, forever
The hardest nigga
Ever to touch this microphone
Got you bitch niggas trailin' his tail
Keep trying nigga, keep trying nigga
Eternity, infinity
So remember Makaveli The Don
His thug life lives on
Black Cotton, Black Cotton
Black Cotton – a symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tale
Ghetto gospel, that is, listen!
Rotten Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak!
Black cotton, steady stressin', Smith & Wessons, count my blessings
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave?
Never got paid but still we slave (in the nine tre')
Answer that, then answer this too
Love's gonna get ya, you know it's true – life's a bitch, true?
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter, G? Black cat got your tongue?
Do ya feel me? Dum dum diddy, is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace, then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seein' bodies on the streets deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies – POOF!
We used to have troops, but now there's no more youth to shoot
God, come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (in God's eyes)
Nobody don't care (No matter how hard I try
Look to the sky, and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my dreams
Drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care (Feels like I'm pressed
Why do I stress? It's like I'm bein' tested)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my prayers
Vanished in thin air, please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care
In the belly of the beast I'm bubblin' up
Runnin' out of luck, about to self-destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
You're sure to catch her with your one-day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool, but it ain't fix nothin'
Look what the 80's did to us baby kids
And now we grown up, nobody ain't own us yet
Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me
I'm workin' without a profit, they shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin', but keep in mind, it ain't irkin'
And we ain't stop, it's curtains
You try to rise and certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridaz
Runnin' up, gun cocked, black mask and gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove, no love
Waitin' for my 40 acres and a blunt to blaze
Biblical times, good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton – I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton – I ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine
Black Cotton
Nobody don't care (No matter how hard I try
Look to the sky, and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care (Feels like I'm pressed
Why do I stress? It's like I'm bein' tested)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my prayers
Vanished in thin air, please answer my questions)
(2Pac talking)
Black Cotton
Black Cotton
(Uh yeah)
“my pain?”
It run's deep, share it with me”
(Um)
Black cotton
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is

Loves gonna get ya' you know it's true, life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
What’s the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track got you sprung now your hung (Do ya' feel me?)
Attempt to reach, each and every brother on the streets
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets, deceased
Looking through my high school yearbook
Reminiscing of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies, poof
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of black cotton (Cotton)
In God's eyes
(Chorus)
Mama told me they'd be day's like this but I'm pissed
(Pissed)
Told me they'd be days like this
(They claim that I'm violent)
Rotten black cotton in God's eyes
Rotten black cotton in God's eyes
Hit
(Verse two: Mouse Man)
Black cotton
Rotten as the rest everyday's a test I stress
Protection wear a vest is your best bet
Money hungry thinking 'bout the jack pot
Jewels and fat knot's get props
On the corner slanging marijuana wanna get, paid
Wasn't born with the sliver spoon
(Never had it made)
That's why I act up you say I'm crazy lazy
But this is what you gave me don't have enough to feed my baby
If I decide to sell my soul, swallow my pride you can't
Hide from the truth the youth is dying inside
Look out instead of putting a foot out
Shouting about the negative vibe's look in my eyes mad cause they on the prize
No need to wonder on the under try to stay low
I gotta make my mail slanging that just say no
Crack vial's stay in piles on my door step
The future scare's me you don't hear me
Young black males to the top
Can't be stopped, straight from the school of hard knocks
(Uh)
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black cotton
In God's eyes
Yeah
(They claim that I'm violent)
Rotten black cotton in God's eyes

Searchin' for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin' jewels and shit, yaknahmean?
Straight tatted up
(Baptist, Jehovah Witness) No doubt
(Thugs, we praise Black Jesus, all day)
Young Kadafi in this bitch, set it off, nigga...
We believed in you
For everything you do
Just wanna let you know how we feel
Black Jesus
I do my shootings on a knob, prayin' to God for my squad
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
Like I'm jailin', shots hittin' up my spot like midnight rains hailin'
Ain't tryin' to be trapped on no block
Slangin' them rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin'
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
God's words or a curse like crack?
Shai-tan's way of gettin' us back
Or just another one of my Black Jesus' traps
Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin' up in silence
Dark prayers, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
Give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
'Cause I swear, they tryin' to break my well
I'm on the edge lookin' down at this bottomless pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Submissive souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus, hahahaha
He's like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
Stick-ups, rob past niggas with trigger hiccups
Bodybag you punk pickups when these niggas go put they shit up
Nine-and-a-half out of ten, shorty be twistin' they wrists in cuffs
And for hustlin', go ride on the block with cop Glocks bustin'
They thinkin' that it's funny to kill for real
Plus gettin' twenty 20 bills, twenty minutes makin' money still
Patrollers be rollin' tryna hold us and haunt us
All swooped up and on us, 'cause we groupin' up on corners
My Black easy Jesus, please somebody feed us
I'm shootin', startin' a revolution with my kids
Too close to the sword, he got jail dropped forever, Black Jesus
To this clique I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggas pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggas play together
We die clutchin' glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wish is niggas smoke my ashes
I'll mob on, while they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hate the people livin' in them
I was born an inmate, waitin' to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast 'til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine, trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin' Black Jesus
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
Some say, one day
Oh well, I bail, blazed out drunk as hell
Waitin' to fade, 'cause Black Jesus see
Just how this world treat His seeds, His young
Beat us 'til we dumb for fun, why run
So I say, "Fuck this whole world, bitch," breathless
Time is tickin', our minds clickin', 'til we blackout
Goin' all out, overboard route for clout
All play by the same to see us, Black Jesus
We believed in you
For everything you do
Just wanna let you know how we feel
Black Jesus
We believed in you
For everything you do
Just wanna let you know what you mean
Black Jesus
We believed in you
For everything that you do
Just wanna let you know how we feel
Black Jesus
Against all odds, I'm still here nigga
O.P.D. -- what??!
Aiyyy, I got to get my props for 2Pacalypse
When this album come out, niggas can kiss my ass
Did you think I'd fall?
Introducing you to my criminal crew
Treach, A.D., Apache, Essential
Above the Law, Lench Mob, the Underground Railroad, Digital Underground gets around and we down in this bitch
You got to deal with me on a whole new level motherfucker
Cause I'm gettin' paid
And the more you try to keep niggas away from me
Extra special thanks to my nigga Big John Major
And there's a ghetto in every city and a nigga in every ghetto
Motherfucker we are unstoppable
And uhh, I'm not goin' alive!
The day, I met you
I saw strength
And I knew from, that point on
That you were pure, woman
I want smiles to replace the sorrow
That you've encountered in the past
And since it was strength, that attracted me to you
It will take strength to make it last
My, negative side will attempt to, change you
But please fight that with your aura
It will be your strength, that keep us both standing
While others around us, fall
Black woman, black woman, black woman
Black woman, black woman, ohhhh black woman
I want smiles to replace the sorrow
That you have encountered in the past
And since it was strength, that attracted me to you
It will take strength
To make it last
My, negative side will attempt to change you
But please
Fight that with your aura
While others around us, fall
Keep us standing, while things around us fall
It's your spirit, your strong beautiful spirit
Black woman, it is your beauty
It is your pureness, it is you, and all your love
That make us both stand
Black woman, you are pure, woman to me
Black woman, you are pure, joy to me
The day I met u I saw strength
that u were pure woman 2 me
possessing a spirit that was strong
that u have encountered in the past
and since it was strength that attracted me 2 u
it will take strength 2 make it last
My negative side will attempt 2 change u
while others around us fall
God has a plan, and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan
Through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our savior
And that Christ is returning, someday soon
To unfold the wonderful plan of eternity
By accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and savior
Unless the Lord does return in the coming seven days
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy
2Pac, don't start that blasphemy in here!
Makaveli, the new breed
And I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me
Strugglin', known to hustle, screamin', "fuck they feelings!"
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this:
"Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now, rule one: get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, 'cause they breed envy
Keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies"
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me, I smiled
Picture jewels bein' handed to an innocent child
I never knew, in my lifetime, I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studyin' rules
Now, papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nothin' free, get back what you earned
This Thug Life'll be the death of me
And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my pops told me
Blasphemy!
Nuf for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud
(Remember what my pops told me)
Using the name of the lord in vain
(Remember what my pops told me)
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
We pro'ly in Hell, already, our dumb asses not knowin'
Everybody kissin' ass to go to Heaven ain't goin'
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin' devil niggas daily
Back in the ghetto, doin' wild shit
Lookin' at the sun don't pay
They say Moses split the Red Sea
Babylon beware, comin' for the Pharoah's kids
Retaliation, makin' legends off the shit we did
Still bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waitin' for signs
Livin' by the Nile, while the water flow
It's just that raw shit, nigga, check it (that raw shit)
And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my poppa told me
Blasphemy!
Nuff a dem a steal in the name of the lord
(Remember what my pops told me)
Using the name of the lord in vain
(Remember what my pops told me)
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
(What!)
The preacher want me buried, why? 'Cause I know he a liar
Why you got these kids' minds thinkin' that they evil?
While the preacher bein' freaky, you say, "honor God's people"
Should we cry when the Pope die? My request:
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama, tell me: am I wrong? Is God just another cop
Waitin' to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Knowin' damn well they ain't gonna feed us
In my brain, how can you explain time in B.C.?
Well, he should understand times in this crime land
My thug nation, do what you gotta do
But know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? And my people say
Nuff a dem a steal in the name of the lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holding a bird in a cloud
(Remember what my pops told me)
(Can't I remember what my poppa told me, blasphemy)
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
In Earth as it is in Heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
As we give up our debts
As we forgive our debt-ors
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil
For God's is the kingdom and the power
And the glory forever and ever and ever
In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias "Makaveli." Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:
It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches
Power and money, ridaz and punks
Which side are you on?
*Heartbeat* *Gunshots*
*Encroaching footsteps*
You niggas still breathin'? Fuckin' roaches
A'ight, it's the Raid on cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo shit, bring it!
Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Expose snakes ‘cause they breed freely
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
You'll find me, look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, nah mean?
I hit the scene, niggas duckin' from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word a fuckin' nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs, down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in ’em
Cut ’em down, to Hell is where we send ’em
My whole team trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Two big pits, I call them "my bitch-nigga eaters"
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, JAY-Z die too
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay!
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog's free – bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
For so many days, in so many ways we've been duckin' strays
They delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission, sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch, yo I'm dyin' with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a ma'fuckin' Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made "Paparazzi"
If you ain't in this rap game for the motherfuckin' cash, mane
E.D.I. Mean, born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first, bitch!
Biatch! Come on, bring it, down with it!
Then we ride
Come on, bring it
Bomb first when we ride
Hey, get that nigga!
Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin' patent leather
Causin' massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin, you're tellin' fairy tales, dunn
"King of New York" like you the motherfuckin' one?
Gettin’ rich, even though it's hard
With no warning signs, ‘cause yo, my man took five
Now I'm the youngin with the 9 ready to put in my time
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
Please reconsider 'fore you die
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
Murder and pain come wit' the game if you choose to roll
Nigga don’t sleep
Now in my every way get murmuring, I'm on a quest to tease better shit
Nutt-So we got to live, we stepped ahead of these cowards
Half-hearted bitch niggas that love the taste of the power
But it's only the chosen, as we continue on blowin' shit
Even in the afterlife, we still blast tonight
In plain do that nigga shoulda stay truest
State of the war got go sleepin', no one leavin', now we eating
It don’t quit it, don’t stop
Young Napoleon, Napole-on, it’s on, it’s on again
When liquor sip touched my liver, tell me will it ever end
I’m tired of mournin'
Wake up to another dead in the mornin'
Pray ‘fore I went to bed, still woke up dreamin' lead
They wanna talk and drink a brew and claim they Thug Life too
Murder and pain come wit' the game if you choose to roll
Kickin' doughs, puttin' holes in mothafuckas leavin' hoes disposed of
Nigga lay ya down when I creep, on a mission to send ya six feet
Nigga don’t sleep
I blast first to they body, like my guns in varieties
Runnin' wit' the real big willies, that you silly punks try to be
But front, doin' my walk-bys rollin' blunts
Hands on my nuts in a getaway car full’a stunts
Addicted to my nine, movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples, nigga nuttin' simple 'bout mine
Etch a sketch it, dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out, ain't no easy way out on easy exits
Don’t sleep
Walkin' dead in the back, passed out
In my bed, and if I rest
How much I wanna bet how fast I fall over?
The edge on my face flat, but fuck that I’m a soldier
Wide open, tired of livin' lies got me locin'
On mama’s eyes, the drama side won’t stop 'til I smoke ’em, potent
So I’m chokin', floatin', on my feet
Since these bitch niggas creep, why the fuck should I sleep?
Dumpin' on mothafuckas at random, rapidly
Wit' accuracy, they shouldn'ta' talked bad to me
It had to be, a mothafuckin' murder I’m glad to be
The nigga that did the murder so sad to see
Wit' a big ass hole in his head, received by a thug (Nigga), no love
Snatched him up off the asphalt, then drove off to the hills positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Twisted his cap off, wrapped him up in plastic
Slid to the edge, and dumped his ass off
Then notified his whole family, of this tragedy
Murdered 'em without askin' me, who did it
Catastrophe is how I left it and you won’t see the last of me nigga
And I betcha, he got wet up, don't sleep
'Cause you fuckin' wit' realest nigga
Fucked him up with extendo know (Ahh shit, haha)
Not with the sticks mothafucka, it’s game over
When I enter the first zone, worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up, evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy, manifestin' military styles
Casual tragedy when niggas battle me
My Prophecized prediction, switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch, and watch 'em start snitchin'
I personify this thug livin'; Hell or prison
My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world me and the mob gettin' married
It seems horrifying screams pierce the dark
Just as suspected, a trick bitch where is your heart
You mark, watch niggas fall when I call they name
We Outlawz hold your head niggas all the same
We still thuggin' 'til it's no one left
Don't sleep
Murder and pain come wit' the game if you choose to roll
Kickin' doughs, puttin' holes in mothafuckas leavin' hoes disposed of
Nigga lay ya down when I creep, on a mission to send ya six feet
Nigga don’t sleep
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (C'mon, c'mon)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (Sing that shit, sing that shit)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party (2Pac)
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
Sho 'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit
Now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by my young homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I never stop bailin' these (Westcoast G's)
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
You gotta have papers in this world
You doin' your job every day
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the strap, so we die by the strap, kids
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted
Do the gangstas run this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
(Hell yeah)
(Hell yeah)
West side in this motherfuckin' party
West side in this motherfuckin' party
(It's a gangsta party
(It's a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
West side, west side
(It's a gangsta party
West side, west side
(It's a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Death Row
(It's a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party)
Outlawz in this motherfucker
Deathrow in this motherfucker
Stay up y'all, stay representin'
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
Come on, break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Come on break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Tell me why O.P.D. sweatin' me
Is it for the major grip that I'm makin'
Is it for the fact that 'Pac don't be fakin'
Best think before you draw black
I ain't the one to bite my tongue, 2Pacalypse will smoke back
Takin' out the cop team
Don't mock me, sucka just jock me
Better talk it like ya walk it when we swing 'em
Yea little square we can sling 'em
Got a posse you can bring 'em
Watch me, pop, pop, bang, boom, ping 'em
Big D's in the house, pass the crazy horse
'Cause them suckaz can't fade me, yeah
(Yea!, yea Mopreme Shakur, thug life, Outlaw)
Kill a nigga kill a nigga (strictly representing)
Come on, break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Kill a nigga kill a nigga
Come on break em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Dub-C and they got me on some freestyle type shit huh
So nigga go and run hard as you can and take cover
And I can't stand them niggas in [?]
Fuck a dancer, I'm hoopin' 'cause my crew don't dance
Madder than a serial killer on a hoe stroll
And I don't know about y'all but I'm down to rep
Packin' all these niggas who be dissin' the underground
Motherfuck god, I diss 'em on wax
Oops there goes that ghetto mentality
The same reason you never see my video on your T.V
'Cause we don't say what they want us to say
Fuck rhythm and blues and the police too fool
You niggas can't stop me if I gave ya a free steel to the jaw, you still couldn't drop me
So don't try to sneak on that creep tip
'Cause you'll get that ass kicked quick bitch
Suckers will get knocked down
Dub-C bringin' noise from the mother fuckin' underground
Kill a nigga kill a nigga
Come on, break 'em off somethin'
Yea, come on break 'em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Kill a nigga, kill a nigga
Come on break 'em off somethin'
Yea, come on break em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Wicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion
Wicked wicked, in that Oak Town fashion
Wicked Money B, I am that odical dodge
(Who's bad?)
I'm the worst-est wicked as I wanna be
Stand if you want to, but don't you dare stand in front of me
Daddy Mack trickin', what you did then all fuckin' shit up
Well here's a little more dick for you to suck
And all these years that I be rappin'
Styles that I'll be flashin'
If I find ya, you'll be hidin' in my face
I'll be on it like a [?]
Stingin' like a bumble
Fuck the humble
Got this stamina to be on the mic
Mashin' in the stance with the stylist boots
I'm a bout to catch a bulge in my pants
And the bigger the butt, the bigger the nut
That I mistrust
I can catch a bum rush
Layin' in the cut, like a panther on the prowl
So agile
Don't ask scoop
You're not a now
But I'll tellin' MC how, we should
Take ya time, take ya, take ya, take ya time
Mc's take ya time, before ya start the rhyme
Take ya time, take ya, take ya, take ya time
So are you Filthy McNasty?, rappin' too fast
Ask me, I say we slow and flow and roll ya ass
Peace to Down W, Big D, 2Pac, and Mack
Sideways to your mommas house
Kill a nigga kill a nigga
Come on, break 'em off somethin'
Yea, come on break 'em off somethin' (with that funky funky style)
Come on break 'em off somethin'
I shift the nigga no respect 'fore he plays me
Come off that bullshit fool you can save these
And if you think I'm fuckin' around, hear the gun pop
Gotta break your ass off, some of that reality
Niggas don't know about the D to the E to the B
The shit on the microphone motherfuckers can't fuck with
You want something to play with?
Warm your ass like gum
As I push in the clip pump pump
From a woman's perspective
As I pump and stomp huh
To make a fly guy gotta shake they rumps
Money B and W.C. the D.E.B down with the motherfuckin S.T
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?
Tell me, nigga, tell me
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?
Enemies give me reason
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Couldn't rest, nah nigga, I was stressed
Had me creepin' 'round corners, homie, sleepin' in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block, call the cops
A thug nigga screamin' Westside, bustin' double Glocks
Hittin' corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got me drivin' up on the curb
Hand on the steerin' wheel, swervin'
Just let me live on the streets ‘cause ain't no peace for me in jail
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside, Outlaw, Bad Boy killer
Complete my mission, my competition no longer beefin'
I murdered all them bustas, now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Stressed but busta free
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
For all my soldiers gone we burnin' the Earth
Outlawz worldwide, we pack the block
Shootin' rocks at the kid, I'll bust back for Pac
Stale down here, too many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me?
Young Noble, Outlaw 'til these motherfuckers kill me
Now, we was raised "fuck this life," my wrongs, my rights
Holdin' on a tight grip, with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm cynical, sleep walkin' as a true
Walk around town with a pound full of bitter food
Came a long way from my born day
Dead away where there's war play
Fuck friends! I'll say, rather die for my A-K
Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Talkin' 'bout a bad day—I live a life like that
It's severe, and I'm losin' my hair, bless a hooligan
Catch me, I'm fallin' out flat yo, I'm ruined and
I learned to like it like that when I was still in Mommy
The side of the city that the Devil run from
And still I'm totally wasted, they want me to face this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one, motherfucker, 'bout to do it again
We movin' in for the kill, for a meal, holdin' steel
Hold the wheel
I'm 'bout to give these niggas somethin' they can feel
Fakin' real, but we the raw and uncut
And we still breathin' and we still breathin'…
Tell 'em! Nigga, tell 'em! (And we still breathin'…)
Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Yeah
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?
Tell me nigga, (tell me)
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin'
Catch 'em while they sleepin', now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin', my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin', now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Woke up with fifty enemies plottin' my death
Couldn't rest, nah nigga I was stressed
Had me creepin' 'round corners, homie sleepin' in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block, call the cops
Hittin' corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got me drivin' up on the curb, hand on the steerin' wheel swervin'
Bless me Father I'ma sinner, I'm livin' in hell
Just let me live on the streets, 'cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Gettin' world-wide exposure
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside Outlaw; Bad Boy killer, huh
Complete my mission my competition no longer beefin'
I murdered all them bustas now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin'
Catch 'em while they sleepin', now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Enemies give me reason, to be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin', my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin', now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Hoppin' out my four door Chevy, in this game, I'm still heavy
Promise not to cum quick
You fuckin' around with the Don bitch, I run shit, with one clip Mr. Makaveli quick to mack, go back to the telly
I fuck a bitch like I'm psychotic, I think that's what they tell me
Fuck around I don't fight fair
Open fire, 'cause my desire is to ride
Got every nigga signed to Bad Boy, prayin' that I die
They couldn't see the coward in they eyes, 'til they died
They wonder why, they targets
Defenseless, when my squad hits, hard niggas
Brenda's got a baby
I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
"That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family"
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his arms
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Momma say you makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name
Hey
Watch me
Wipe 'em scared
Why is it that we gotta be
(Watch your back)
Contacting niggas in the cemetery
Funeral homes
Seein' all my homies buried
Moms all worried and shit
Why is so many black brothaz dyin
One day we can all be together smokin' weed gettin' high
Wheres your family at?
Fuck one Love nigga
Now it's time for
Cross the nigga that put food inside your stomach?
Point the pussy out the crowd time to pay for
Past discretions, never learned your lessons in this deadly war
Let's explore the possibilities, them niggas killing me
Head all busted
Over this trick nigga I trusted, now it's
And, never in my deepest thoughts figured he could turn on me
So many to choose from
Niggas close to me I wonder how I lose them (How I lose one)
Maybe because I put them on the podium before me (Oh yes)
I use to think that's how it should be
Until them niggas cross me, it's different now (Different now)
Bitches wait until I got cold (Turn it up)
And told a boldfaced lie (Lie)
But still I never asked why (Turn it up) (Why?)
Cause now I got my eye on you (Got my eyes on you)
Before my crew, remember how you do
Now you want to pursue
The B.D Buck just because your jealous as a motherfucker (Jealous as a
Motherfucker)
Every man has a right to decide his, own destiny
In the end it's
And in this judgment there is, no partiality
So arm in arms (Arm in arms)
Overcome all the troubles
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your fight) (Your fight is my fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
I showed you love but you the same one that tried to fuck me
You see, snitching is an epidemic killing disease
Exit
Throw your gun away, take your time, free your mind
Forget about the crime, and it will all go away in time
My information strictly based on niggas faces
Past cases with the law, plus a life of living raw
Every man has a right to decide his, own destiny
And in this judgment there is, no partiality
So arm in arms (Arm in arms)
We fight to live and struggle (Fight to live and struggle)
And that's the only way to
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Let's get it on now
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Let's get it on now
Let's get it on now
My fight is your fight, we could do this all day and all night
So I tell you what, One Nation, we gon' set up this plantation
This foundation, and we gon' take it to the real enemy
The one who ain't a friend of me
The one, the war continues, the struggle continues
There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggas die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Got my pistol out the window screamin', "Lord come and get me"
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin' my clip, I'm watchin' every bullet spit when I kick 'em
Niggas die from automatic gunfire
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Had a motherfuckin' warrant but he didn't go to court
God damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
But don't blame me, blame the flame that flickers
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberaces, Versaces, and you Nazis
Watch me, 'cause you figured you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed and you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' them go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sicked on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
But don't blame me
Nigga go in the hell with my finger on the trigger
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
Bullet to the brain!
A young nigga tryin' to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin' please come and save me
The whole world done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin' die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, aww shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high 'til they bury me
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, thug nigga
Stressin' like a motherfuckin' drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die
Bury me a G
Remember me? Life as a G
These money making activities is killin' me
I'm tryna ball but this alcohol making me hurl
Paranoid like its me against the world
My only question: When I ride will I be murdered, a victim of some homicide, did I deserve it?
My life is full of misery
Intoxicated I can barely see
I can't sleep having dreams somebody's killing me
Am I sane?
My life is pain and I'm stressin'
Brothaz be trippin'
They open fire where I rest
Hopin' for death
But I'm still livin' every breath
Won't be for me
Retaliation every death
Lets make em' bleed
Cause do or die is the only way
And though I pray
I can see you getting sicker everyday
And I ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
See I ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die they don't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
But when the ???jump from the front??? I'mma do my thing
I got problems, so I loc'd up, when they killed my parents
They screaming out 'Peace!', but everybody is deceased
Just bury me a G...
In the stray, getting paid is the way i play (what?) for keeps
Thinkin' back, reminiscin' on my teens
A young G, gettin' paid over dope fiends
Fuckin' off cash that I made
Nigga, what's the sense of workin' hard, if you never get to play
I'm hustlin', stayin' out 'til it's dawn
And comin' home at 6 o'Clock in the mornin'
Hand's on my Glock, eyes on the prize
And I be Shootin' craps, bustin' niggas out the door
Stuck on full, drunk again
Spill a little liquor for the homies in the pen'
Say them thug life niggas be like major pimps
Stickin' to the rules wasn't made to simp
Keep my finger on my Mac mane
The crack game ain't shit
Niggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
(and I) I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
And I'll be stayin' strapped
My Mac-11 make my nuts bigger
I keep my finger on the trigger for you jealous niggas
Wonder why a motherfuckers nutty, and why I'm up worried
When I see a cemetery full of dead buddies
Mama told me "son, don't lie"
And Mama's in the back smokin' crack and a nigga wanna die
Can't cry cause I'm loc'd up
Choked up, nigga puffing on that indo getting fucked up
And in the back of my mind, I know I'm wrong
Alcohol make a young motherfucker think he ballin'
On the phone, tryin' to bone cause I miss ya
Back on the streets I'm losin' focus
I'm hopeless, homies dyin' over small time dope shit
The crack game ain't shit
I ain't got time for bitches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches

And motherfuckers catchin' drug cases
I place my Glock outside my waist and keep a thug face
Even on a good day!, gotta stay strapped
Livin' in my hood, hey!
Niggas will spray caps
And everybody wanna go to heaven, don't nobody wanna pray
So I stay clutchin' on my AK
Murderin' niggas that oppose me
Time to make my get-away
I hid away in the backstreets
Couldn't let the police jack me
Gotta be quiet, I'm on the down low
I got that ya-yo movin' by the pound so
When the police try me out, fuck the judge
Got a homie that'll bond me out, straight love
Keep my finger on my Mac man
The crack game ain't shit
Niggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches

Mama don't cry, bury me a G
Stuck on fool, Tanqueray got a nigga high
Just cause I fucked, don't mean I trust her
Now my pagers vibratin', can't sleep
So I'm mobbin' to the ho's house, bumpin' Isley
Bitch recognized game and started laughin'
Now I'm all in the guts and shit
Prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
Cause I'll fuck and get up, I'll let you know

Lots of hoes gettin' mad as shit
Keep my finger on my Mac man

Mama don't cry, bury me a G
Now I ain't got time for bitches, bitches, bitches..
California love
California knows how to party
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre puttin' it down for Californ-i-a
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city, the city of Compton
South Central

In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?

Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throwdown, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish
I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony

Another warrant, two of America's most wanted
Party, party
California Love, y'all!

We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre

Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way

Richter scale talking about a earthquake on the richter scale-la'
City of Compton, city of Compton where the girls shake their booty's
Computer-puter-puter-puter-puter-puter-puter, Joe
The blind stares of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin' hard but won't realize
That they will never see the P!
You must be goin' blind
Give me my money in stacks and lace my bitches with dime figures
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch 'em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire, now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the West, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like hoes, open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe? Nigga, you ain't know?
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money, but baby, I've gots to get mo'
Bail's paid now, nigga, look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by niggas can't see me!
The stares of a million pairs of eyes
You can't see me
Been gettin' word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Sayin' they can get with us, but picture me gettin' served
My own mama say I'm thugged out
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what! It ain't nothin' but a party when we thug
And there I was, a young nigga with heart, ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Alizé and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me
The life of a boss player, fuck what you thought though
Die like a bitch when my album hit the streets; niggas can't see me!
Niggas can't see me
They can't see me
Which way did he go, George?
Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?
You niggas made a mistake
Them thug niggas have arrived and it's judgement day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin' bring me money, then I'm rappin' till I'm paid
I'm gettin' green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut
Don't be a dumb motherfucker 'cause it's crazy after dark
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart; niggas can't see me!
Yo, check this out: stay off his dick
Niggas can't see me
Right before your eyes, I'll disappear from here
You niggas can't see me
You can't see me
I know it's hard nigga, I'm all up in your face
But you still can't see me
All up in your range, but niggas can't see me
20/20 vision won't visualize
All those glasses won't help you realize
You blinded, you blinded, you can't see me
You can't see me
Don't believe everything you read!
Alizé and weed
You can't see me, right before your very eyes
You won't even visualize, you can't see me
Dr. Dre all day, 2Pac
Niggas can't see me
This one's for you, BIG baby
'Cause you bitch-ass niggas can't see me
Niggas can't see me
You can't see me
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
You won't see me
Yeah, first you see me, now you don't
Wanna see me, but you won't
Come to see me, but you can't
Oh, you can't see me
Right between your eyes and you'll never realize
Visualize what you can't see
Yeah niggas, you can't fuck with us
Tell 'em to come the fuck on
But even cuter behind the barrel of my six shooter Oh
You look worried cause I ain't burried
Punks leave in a hurry cause I throw flurries making mothafuckas, scurry
Come feel the flavor from my single
And uh How's that for black history?
I stay strapped, and love to jack those that slang that crack misery Ha
Cause being a nigga means you love niggas
But how could you love niggas if you trying drug niggas?
You motherfuckas need your caps peeled
Cause when blacks kill blacks we stay trapped and thats, real
It's time to get more realistic for the young the black and the gifted
And uh
Until my people get uplifted
There's no popping shit, just popping clips instead of marching we gon' rip
Shit
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
How should I plead? Forever thuggin' on a quest to get G's
Runnin' from enemies ever since the days of a seed
I'm under pressure, the stress will have me drinkin'
Thinkin' niggas after me, much too paranoid to blink
Wonder why the police don't wanna see me stackin' G's
They after a playa, but I won't let 'em capture me
I gotta thank the Lord for the weed and the nicotine
I can't sleep, close my eyes, I see wicked things
I keep my pistol by my bedside, one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homicide, my life's in danger
I'm probably wrong, but I'll never know it till I'm gone
From out the gutter where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
But they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
Fuck them skinhead ass niggas
Fuck the police, and the clan, here's what we do to the motherfuckin' Clan, Let's move
They got me mobbin like I'm Loc'ed
And ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - paaassion
I'm a nut and drinkin Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die
Tell me why? 'Cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck-fifty across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards want to kill me in my sleep
But will they can I see
Steady thuggin' in the streets
And I'll be ballin' loc
Don't let 'em make you worry
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to Mutha I'm touched
I'm kickin dust up
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean
Until they kill me
I'll be livin this life
I know you feel me
There's so much pain
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
Some say the Government will watch me
But they can't stop me
I'm droppin' evil with the people as my posse
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
Toppling OBSTACLES placed in the way
Can u c the pride in the Pantha
The seed must grow regardless
of the fact that it's planted in stone
CAN'T u c the Pride in the panthas
as they unify as one
The flower blooms with brilliance
and outshines the ray of the Sun
This song is dedicated
To the mothers and the children of the revolution
From 2Pac, to Afeni Shakur
And many many more
This is for you
Can you see.. the pride of the panther
As she nurtures.. her young all alone
It's the seed.. that must grow regardless
Of the fact that, it's been planted in stone
It's the seed.. that must come to harvest
It's the tree.. that must grow out of love
Can you see the pride in the panther
Topling obstacles placed
In the way of the progression of his race?
As she nurtures her young, all alone?
Can't you see the pride of the panthers
As they unify, as one?
The flower blooms with brilliance and
Outshines all the rays of the sun
Keeps bright like the rays of the sun
Carries out like the rays of the sun
Shines bright like a new day begun
Can you see the pride in the panther
As he glows in splendor and grace?
In the way of the progression of his race
Can you see the pride in the panther
As she nurtures her young all alone?
The seed must grow, regardless
Of the fact that it's been planted in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers
As they unify as one?
The flower blooms, with brilliance
And outshines all the rays of the sun
Carries out like a new day begun (uh-huh)
It shines bright like the rays of the sun (hah)
And keeps high like a new day begun
Keeps high like a new day begun
Carry out like the rays of the sun
Keep on like a new day begun, say
Shine bright like the rays of the SUN!
Keep high like a new day begun, say
Shine bright like the rays of the SUN!
Keep high like a new day begun, yes

A new day begun begun begun begun
Begun begun begun.. hoo!
He said.. power to the people! (Power to the people)
He said.. power to the people! (Power to the people)
He said.. love is people power (LOVE)
Love is people power (LOVE)
Love is people power (when all else crumbles)
Love is people power (love must prevail)
Love is the people's power
Every revolutionary act is a act of love
And love is the engine of the revolution
I love y'all, like 'Pac loved y'all
Like Afeni loved 'Pac, like we love Afeni
* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists
It's said that every revolutionary act is a act of love
All power to the people
I said the P is for power, the A for action
The N-T because now is the time to get it done
See the H is for heart, and the E for effect
The R hold it down at the end for respect
Who am I? A panther
What I got I got PRIDE, what I wanna be FREE
Who am I? A panther
Who am I? A panther
Raise your hands in the air if you feel like me
Can you see the pride of the panther
As he glows in splendor and grace?
Topling obstacles placed
In the way of the progression of his race
Can you see the pride in the panther
As she nurtures her young, all alone?
The seed must grow, regardless
Of the fact that it's planted, in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers
As they unify, as one?
The flower blooms, with brilliance
Outshines, like the sun
Shines bright, like the sun
Brings light, like the sun
P is for power, the A for action
The N-T because now is the time to get it done
See the H is for heart, and the E for effect
Who am I? A panther
Who am I? A panther
What I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE
What I got I got PRIDE, what I wanna be FREE
Raise your hands in the air if you feel like me
Who am I? A panther
What I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE
What I got I got PRIDE, what I wanna be FREE
This song is dedicated to all those who live and die for the struggle
Panthers, children of the Panthers, or all those, who strive for
Free minds, free souls, free bodies.. for freedom
And love.. love.. love is the engine to the revolution
Whassup? It's 2Pac. Can you get away?
Let me come swoop you up
(You know I got a man)
(Of course he gon' mind)
Let me take you to lunch, I'll have you back before he even get home, before anybody see
(I can't, he ain't gon' let me
Aww c'mon! Pleeeeeease...
(Nah)
Why you got on glasses?
Ever since I met ya I could peep the pressure
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations – would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love makin'
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's gettin' clearer
I tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone
And find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate – but in my heart I know you worth it
Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon… Let's go… Can you get away?
So much pressure in the air (I know, I know)
And I can't get away (Just for a little while love)
I'm not happy here (I know it's hard but, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air
(Let's go man, get up outta there, can you get away?)
And I can't get away (Do you love him?)
Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
Ain't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me
‘Cause they phony
‘Cause I can tell, my life with you would be delicious
Even though I got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses when he ain't lookin'
Now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Come see tomorrow
Let you know I care – that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste
We can hook up at the store. Can you get away?
So much pressure in the air (I know it is)
And I can't get away (Yeah, you can)
I'm not happy here (You ain't happy, huh? Can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (I know… is he beatin' on you?)
I'm not happy here (Throwin' you around the house?)
I sit here reminiscin' and I hope you listenin'
In the position to pressure and offer competition
‘Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home – that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to this sucker
‘Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows, on who controls will it last?
Before I ask, I hope you see that I'm sincere
And even if you stay with him today I'm still here
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me, can you get away?
And I can't get away
I'm not happy here
(Let me take you away, all I wanna know, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (Man)
And I can't get away (Course you can get away)
I'm not happy here
(If you really wanted to get away, you could get away)
You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man, ya know what I'm sayin'?
Where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
He beatin' on you and shit; look how you look!
You too motherfuckin' raw to be with that nigga
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Shake that sucker to the left
Ya know what I'm sayin'? You need to be on first class
Seein' what this world got to offer you
Not goin' to, ya know what I'm sayin'?
The emergency room, gettin' stitches
Can you take me from here?
Can you take me from here?
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeahhh
Can you see the pride in the Panther
As he grows in splendor and grace
Toppling obstacles placed in the way,
of the progression of his race.
Can you see the pride in the Panther
as she nurtures her young all alone
The seed must grow regardless
of the fact that it is planted in stone.
as they unify as one.
The flower blooms with brilliance,
and outshines the rays of the sun.
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
Word up, hahahahaha
You was trouble right from the starrrrt, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin loud, I wanna say
But I can't help from walkin out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
Guilty feet have got no rhythm sucka for love
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool, a sucka for love
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given, a sucka for love
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes, and gettin ghost
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin calls at the house, guess you cheatin
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin, I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love
I'm never gonna dance again, hahahaha thats right
Guilty feet have got no rhythm, sucka for love
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool, a sucka for love
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given, a sucka for love
So I'm never gonna dance again
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It use to be love, happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed, no need to lie
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
Hahahha thats right sucka for love
A sucka for love, a sucka for love
Turn the lights out from the muthafuckin' top
I’m with 2Pac in this bitch
Yeah
Capital R shit, they all shit
("Ain’t nothin' but a gangsta")
Las Vegas, Crooked I, Tha Row mix, bitch
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the (S-N double-O-P, Dogg), my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hoes
And it goes, I got both heaters cocked and I’m ready to ride
Whoever’s ready for beef better be ready to hide
75 shots for whoever survive
Yeah, niggas leave the scene, but never alive
I'm in a cut-up with a slut up top
I got a come-up plot, don’t come up shot
What up, Pac?
So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and (Snoop) about to clown
I'm losin’ my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish
Yeah, we livin' lavish y'all, getting cabbage is a habit y'all
Before it's over, I'ma have it all
Have a broad in a camisole with the cameras on
And they've been hating since the minute I blew
Let my enemies witness me in a new blue Infiniti Q
Sippin' Coke mixed with Hennessy too
Whoever ain't a friend of me in this industry is finna be through
Yeah, you...
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta...")
West Coast, Tha Row mix, nigga
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party
Now give me fifty feet
And keep whatever's left of me
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
Boss playa, boss playa, get the money and floss later
We off haters, scratch 'em out like a cross fader
I'm Darth Vader, strapped like a violator
Them Southern Cal streets is wild as Al-Qaeda
Better watch it if you in and bang
Ride first class here, leave under the plane
Listen mayne, you're better off trying to spread love
Brand new West, I'm the head of
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (biatch), tryin' to do a show a day
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
My nigga (Dogg) with me, eternally the most wanted
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta...")
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta...")
("Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party")
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the worldwide gangsta party
Yeah, D. Vegas, Crooked I, Makaveli
Without them weak ass niggas
Capital R, niggas, yeah
Row in peace
I wanted u more than I wanted me
I remember my last thought at night was of u
and my first thought in the morning was of u
It has been a long time since I've actually
sat and adored u but every once in awhile
your beautiful smile guides me through a day
I hear u R with another and u R expecting
I wish u good luck he is lucky 2 be able
c u in heaven!
Ahahha all my homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down (never)
Westside, westside
Part two of the war
Cross this nigga here, now Biggie tell me who do you fear?
My last foe flashed and I mashed his ass
Bastard, fuck with me, bet I blast your ass
So many follow but can't reach me, caught in the maze
Catch 'em, mimickin' my style tryin' to talk this way
Impossible my posse droppin' you, we Death Row riders
No need to beg, motherfucker, ain't no mercy inside us
Feelin' blessed, the richer I get, the more I stress
Dear God I been feelin' like I'm close to Jesus
Paranoid with my pistols close, smokin' trees
Watchin' niggas catch stray, shake, choke and bleed
Me, a mercenary for the street, check my pedigree
Bustin' motherfuckers it's the thug in me
Now niggas talk a lotta Bad Boy shit, then get to squealin'
Bitch made catchin' feelins
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town

Screamin' bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town

Drunk than a motherfucker droppin' my gun
Or high as a kite hittin' hoes for fun
And that ain't fair, dog, your heart pump fear
In the state I, shoot you better hide nigga, chute is near
And you know just as well I do
You ain't no killer, so kill that, you wouldn't kill if you had to
We take the gospel from Makaveli, pass it around

We're gonna ride 'til the wheels fall off, pay attention
Screamin' "Bye bye bitches, untouchable sound"
Ride or die niggas, and we huntin' you down
Representin' all the real niggas stuck in the trap
Bangin' out with the po-po, tryin' to get to some more
Street life, young strugglers racin' the clock
That's the world with feelings, this a man's world youngin
The bitches in business, so learn a little something
Hey, stop runnin' your mouth, you're on the verge of squealin'
Bitch made catchin' feelins
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?

Everybody's a gangsta, but don't put in work
Instead of puttin' on the armor, niggas put on skirts
These drugs ain't helpin', it only makin' it worse
And the streets ain’t got nothing for me but a hearse
I only roll with the real
Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down

(Haha, westside, westside)
Oh this part two of the beef

Cross this nigga here, now Biggie tell me who do you fear?
Ain't a livin' soul breathin' shall pump no fear here

Shit, I'm a changed man
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
By age sixteen I sold to dope fiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gun smoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin' diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon
Niggas trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a ballin' cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
Fuckin' with a changed man
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
A changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
In drop top, the Glock cocked
Not if they got niggas, doughboys and hot niggas
Who mighta shot niggas but only by skrilla
I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
Or anything you see flashin' past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalate back seat - don't creep
Oh what you think, T.I.P and them sweet? (Don't sleep)
Get you hit from your head to your feet (And you don't know me)
You walk in, exploded and leave reload
You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
No three niggas here are gonna let me be
Or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man
You go and drink the Henn' up
A changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
You fuckin' with a changed man
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin' through coastin'
Screamin' out M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
I fucked the world, the judge gave me probation
GIMME MINE, or I'm blastin' on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin' until I'm gone
And fuck a bitch, 'cause a true sister love niggas
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the mass of smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries BLEED
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
You fuckin' with a changed man
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
You fuckin' with a changed man
A changed man, you're dealin' with a changed man
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
You fuckin' with a changed man
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
Nigga you fuckin' with a changed man
All my real thug niggas, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up

Hahaha, you fuckin' with a changed man
Hahaha, I ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
Changed man
Shit, I'm a changed man
Ay, turn the lights out
Me and Big motherfucking Syke
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look
(Niggas fucking with a changed man)
By age sixteen I sold to dope fiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gun smoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin' diamond
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a balling cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The game plan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin' is
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)
Million dollar plots
Birds and flocks is how I wanna live
It's hard to change after living so negative
What I give back is Mac's and packs and facts
And ever lasting game watch your back and stacks
Young macks stay the loc'est and keep the focus
Don't get ground to bow down nigga soak this, game
From a criminal element stay wide open
Bud smoking nigga trip, get to gat smoking
Watch thieves, fake G's and perpetration
Put slug's in these wanna be thugs
In these drugs, bud and alcohol
After all they got Pen's for us, and our future kids
All the things I did, where's my cig's?
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin' out
M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin' to the whole nation
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin' until I'm gone
And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggas
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the mass of smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries BLEED
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin' with a changed man
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)
Everybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggas don't know me
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin' with a changed man
This fuckin' shit on Deathrow
Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
Hahaha..Nate Dogg up in this biatch you know that nigga ain't no muthafuckin joke
You know what time it is
Hahaha.. I ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin' with a changed man
Kurupt in this biatch
Bad azz and Snoop dog
Aiite
I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
Cops give a damn about a negro
One less hungry mouth on the welfare!"
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
"It's time to fight back," that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change… and that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
You gotta operate the easy way
"I made a G today," but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids
"I gotta get paid!" — well hey, but that's the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
We gotta make a change
Let's change the way we eat
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive
And still I see no changes; can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this
You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat," that's the way it is
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is, aww yeah
(You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
("I don't know.")
Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here
("Hell yeah.")
Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room
("Hey there, bitch, where Suge at, nigga?")
Call Suge, call all the niggas tell 'em to meet me downstairs
("Where K and them niggas at man?")
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around
("Ay, y'all seen my shoes?")
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggas drivin' or y'all flyin' back, whassup?
("Man, I'm rollin' man, fuck that shit.")
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
("Fuck that, I lost some money, nigga.")
Aw nigga, damn
Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, 'til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scene
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time!!
Gotta go nigga, gotta go
("Y'all know what time it is!")
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man, call that valet motherfucker
Tell him to get a nigga shit, cause we out this, motherfucker
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's trump tight
So I find time to recline
Sneak in your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night
I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
Cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
Aiyyo man 'Pac, ay, where the where the fuck is Daz at man?
This nigga locked up or somethin'?
The only one not to leave
Yo man, it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother
(You seem them bitches?)
We out man, fuck that shit
Yo Rece! Yo nigga, whassup?
Hey, I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
My behavior is crazy from what you did to me baby
