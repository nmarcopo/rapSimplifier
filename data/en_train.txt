I told my brothers to take my breath away if I resort to a snitch
But I have 21 4L, no way am I going to change
Break it, I break it
I break it down, I break it down
Penitentiary opportunities just to earn a couple bucks

Well, no problem, I will appear on everyone's album
You know what the result will be
I'm hitting a thousand
It got to the point that these rappers don't even like to rap with me
And he said he saved me a place on a new record that he got
He calls it "a lot", I open my book and write
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I imagine him inside a cell on a cot
¨ Reflecting on how you got to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle because they screwed up his shot
I just want you to know that you have it, my nigga
Although I never knew you, I know that you are special

Every day I'm alive, I go with the stick
I'd rather be in jail than be rich and dead
I told my brothers to take my breath away if I resort to a snitch
But I have 21 4L, no way am I going to change
Break it, I break it
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang against the world, my friend and I, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really screwed me up
My brother got life and took me to the streets.
I've been through the storm and turned me into a G

You're a black man standing, I love to see things like that
Question

Get them to play from the machines? (Much)
I can see behind the smoke and the mirrors
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm in a money routine
I don't want to smoke, I want cream
I don't want any more comparisons
This is a marathon and I am aware
I've been playing a bet for lack of promotions
I was never one to brag and brag
You know what the result will be
I'm hitting a thousand
It got to the point that these rappers don't even like to rap with me
Fuck it because my nigga 21 Savage hit me
And he said he saved me a place on a new record that he got
He calls it "a lot", I open my book and write
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I imagine him inside a cell on a cot
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle because they screwed up his shot
I just want you to know that you have it, my nigga
Although I never knew you, I know that you are special
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga

I've seen so many handshakes turned hate (turned hate)
Seen so many BFs become s-n-a-k (Turn a snakes)
Death before dishonor tattooed on my face (on my face)
The way I run the check, it should have been with Chase (been with Chase)
I started at the bottom, the trenches, the gutters, so I had to go a little bit harder (straight)
The lights were off, the gas was off, so we had to boil the water (directly)

Dope on my margella, dope on my wrist and my fist because I'm cooking coca man
And I hope you don't think we broke up man
Critics say change my attitude

Don't make me show you what the Mac 11 does
Standing in the trap, he made a hundred thousand
Call Domingo, pick up the extension, nail him

Look my Rolly is flooding, I can't see the moment
All right until the niggas in your pussy start to die

Tell my shooter to grab the choppa
Nigga starts shooting
If a nigga try me

Nigga starts shooting
When your stomach keeps talking
Lil sister needs school clothes
You hold on to forty
Voices in my head

They all say they are bosses but
Really all by themselves
There's no real niggas left
Cause all the real niggas are gone
They are dead or on the road
Niggas going wrong
Man these streets so cold, so cold
I swear these streets are so cold, so cold
I pray to God to watch over my soul
And let me know whose friend or enemy you are
RIP Johnny B
Died right in front of me

And I slept with rats and roaches
So I don't smoke roaches
Niggas tryna hit my focus
I wonder why I'm drinking potions
We are happy, dog, but we are not kidding
Big bullets, we're not rummaging
In that pussy, slow motion
Nigga, none of my songs wrote
I'm thinking to myself that you're not a gang, nigga, fuck you
Feel like 2pac, thug life, nigga, fuck you
If I had your phone password, I wouldn't have handcuffed you
Bitch I knew I should never trust you
I can't believe you betrayed me, I used to sleep with you
Gangs, gangs, screaming "fuck you", they want to eat you
My son has asthma, Grandma has spasms
Fuck the talk, he's going to talk, put them on the tray
Snakes conspiring in my fall, I can hear them rattle

Snippet lyrics
Like, because I was born abroad, these motherfuckers aren't going to spray
Lift your hood, nigga, 9-1-1, you better call today
From Glenwood to Martin Luther King, niggas know we don't play-we play
Snippet lyrics
I left the crime scene like I was never there
Put a hundred shots in his [?]
Diamonds in my urine, they won't shake hands with a snitch
It is not difficult to find me, I am in the supply of the city
High speed chase, I can't be caught with the stick
Valentine's Day, 2K game and that's it
You took her out to eat and then she sucked his cock
Maybach V12, great state of dawg
Hit your butt, I have a homicide fetish
Come find your bitch, I put my hot dog on her taste
Your baby mommy tests me, she wants a hot dog in her belly
How these niggas are still gangsters and they say?
She will point the finger, but privately she will be stealing
Thirty models in the house, I gave each one a minute
Yes, you know, there are thirty models in the house, really
They say, "Use your time wisely," so I gave each one a minute.
You know what I'm saying? They enjoyed it too
You know it's enough of me to go, don't be stingy
I'm in a rover with a shooter
I have thirty holes in this Ruger
And my Glock gives lessons, he is a tutor
I'm not with the jabber jabber, give your butt the fastest jab
I'm the type of person who buys a Bentley, you're the type who skip a tab

Snippet lyrics
... hot sauce
I have a nigga baby mama
Never turn your back on fame
Rags to wealth, nigga came from the bottom
Hood rats, now a black fucked up on models
Ridin 'abroad, remember to ride MARTA
The routine became more difficult and my mind became more intelligent
I was getting bags for the cheap
When I had no money, I was stealing, nigga
I was getting free bags
21 gang, they were right next to me
A couple of niggas changed, they complained, fuck them
I'm too smart for the street, nigga, to serve an undercover
Niggas try to clone a nigga's shit, damn it, woah
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo
Niggas want a flyer, shit, mine broke
Niggas rappin '' over shit that ain't even lived on
Niggas lying, I can hear it on their improvisations
It's kind of screwed up what they did to Black, damn
If I catch him in the trap, I'll hit him
I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'm gonna hit him
Nigga try to follow this trend
Depend on your daddy
Trying not to let the streets distract me
I know there are potholes along the way like acne
I'm a solid black young man, you can ask C
The Internet will not help you understand me
I'm a street black, yeah I'm famous
Everybody get it with your black flamin '
All these chains in a black like I'm strangling
He ran away with his money, nigga I guess at the time
You imitate gangsters, you're not hitting
In the hood every day, I'm hanging
And it happened when the gang needs
And I use shadows so they can't see
And I pay them attorneys and the bond fees
Nigga a thousand, I'm beyond G
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy
Niggas still asking, "Can you face me?"
My old ho saying "Boy, you grew up"
Promethazine, a black slowed down

You niggas will be pretending that you niggas are fake
You niggas are dumb, you niggas are dumb
Shoot yourself like a bitch, pull up with a stick
Pull you bitch make you eat your dick
Glock 40 full clip, coming out of the hip
I got 21 gangs, you niggas are lame
I'm with BG, they keep that flame
All my killers trained, point blank, I hit them in the face
Thirsty bitch, nasty bitch
Look at my diamonds, he called me handsome
Four inside the fantasy, I turned white like Santa
Playing with my money, meet MC Hammer
Fuck you lil rollie

Gang, gang, gang I grew up in the gang since 1991 nigga and I'll never drop my flag on my nigga sorority code
I was not raised food in the blood of the refrigerator, I have been on the street for 27 years, black
If you're not a gang with us, you can't hang out with the gang's black bitch
I am true blood that is in j.o.e
Take your ass from a distance with that a.r 15 blat blat I'm bleeding black blood
Salsa dripping on my fan bingo shirt, bitch please, I grew up on these streets at birth
Sot nigga, do you know what that nigga means? I didn't think that blood
R.i.p for my young niggas who never went out, that's in god
Whipping on that new benz, bumping into my old friend who hates me cause I got a couple new girlfriends
I think of murder, murder in my mind
Murder on the menu, murder all the time
Today was a good day, you shouldn't spray the K
Today was a good day, pour some Actavis
Today was a good day, cross it off the list
Today was a good day, I sold a yay brick
Today was a good day, my brother beat his case
Today was a good day, day
Murder with .45, murder with nine
Killing that bitch, put that dick up her spine
Killing that bitch, put that dick in her spine (Uh, ooh)
I don't love, I don't hate, I don't make gullible (gullible, yeah)
Dope in the pantry, serving sweets, look colorful (colorful, bright)
I have an extension, it's something new, it has a kick with it (Ayy, ayy)
I'm at gate four (Four gates), driving alone (Ayy, nyoom)
Nigga, it's stolen, get out and park, nigga
Then walk home (Brrap)
All this gang talk, gang talk
Walk with me, red dot on your head turns green
Turn your Twitter fingers into a crime scene (Splat, splat, splat)
Street sweep sweep sweep (Whoop, whoop)
I wonder how I get the drug so cheap
Walk plug, take my bags off (Whoop, whoop, whoop)
Two times ten throughout the week
Hit the deck, goin 'around me'
A couple of shots have a 'round' around me (Ayy, ayy)
A clip but it reached twelve o'clock deep (Whoop, whoop, whoop)
Today was a good day, you shouldn't spray the K
Today was a good day, I woke up with your bitch
Today was a good day, cross it off the list
Today was a good day, I sold a yay brick
Niggas die, many die, die, dead niggas
I pull the trigger, I pull the trigger, I pull the trigger
Niggas die, many die, die, dead niggas
I pull the trigger, I pull the trigger, I pull the trigger
50 drums, air your moms house, do you feel me now?
He left his family full of leaks, on the street we played to keep
Closed coffin, aims at his head, shot him in the teeth
Mud nigga, bell nigga, opp killer, piercer
Memphis, Tennessee, we have real hitters, drug dealers, police killers, gang spitters, sauce drippers
Pussy niggas, you need to bleed
Draco buries you like a seed, I know niggas don't like me
He ran over me 45 flew his back-uh
Rack after rack-uh, you know I've been stacking-uh
Treat this rap shit, man, like I'm rushing, Patta
Today was a good day, you shouldn't spray the K
Today was a good day, pour some Actavis
Today was a good day, I woke up with your bitch
Today was a good day, cross it off the list

Bankroll how am i tip
Turning work, acrobatic
Young wild bitch that I'm catching
Roll down the window and shhh
Roll it up and let it have it
We who cause chaos
Make the jump white like a rabbit
I took your bitch to the cabins
Paid in full if you don't know
I'm not chasing any hoe
I'm not worried about a bitch
I keep extended clips
Wild Young Fresh Jones
I just poured a 4 into a Jones
I could take your baby mom home
She is going to suck me and give me a dome
Rap niggas, I'm not really into that
Put some bullet holes in your outfit
She drove me crazy about her titty
If I say shovel, I dig it
Gangbanging as if it were Suge
Red rag on my Dickies
Slaughter gang bitch claimed that
Excuse me, point to
Fuck you and take your chain
How much do you pay for your chain back?
Yes, I arrive at the Yo with a helicopter and my son
Slaughter gang bomb shit, nigga like Saddam

Young wild bitch, I'm shhh
Catch a black ass in traffic
Roll it up and let it have it
We who wreak havoc
Cooking cocaine
Smoking with propane
I can't wife a hoe, mane
I just want throat, mane
I keep 30 on my waist
Homicide, I beat the case
Spray the stick like a mace
Erase your entire block
I get the shit out from across the border
You play with the gang, they'll kill you

Fresh eating a turkey burger
His helicopter makes you do the Shmurda
Free that nigga Bobby Shmurda
You niggas know I represent that murder
These niggas sneak out, I know
Blowing money like it's Floyd
Hit a nigga like Floyd
I just went to get a Porsche

Your favorite rapper is a hoe
Yes, I arrive at the Yo with a helicopter and my son
Slaughter gang bomb shit, nigga like Saddam

Round drum 50 on my hip

Turning work, acrobatic

Young wild bitch, I'm shhh
Catch a black ass in traffic
Roll down the window and shhh
We who wreak havoc
So cold
My heart so cold
My heart is so cold that I can never bend
I'm on the paper man chase, fuck these hoes
I'm taking pain pills, my heart is moving slowly
All I know is hustle cause I hate being broke
And man, this money is not shit, these cars are not shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit
My heart is so cold, I'm sticking to the code
Fake niggas bend, real niggas don't fold
I'm cheating on J's journal, selling plasterboard by hit
I still have it under my breath
The judge gives you the book, hang your ass without a rope
When deep down you seem to have no hope
Green dots at funerals, they screwed my head
Niggas shot me six times, my luck got screwed
One Hundred Bands Lick Nigga Pussy, Now I'm Fucked
My heart is so cold that I can never bend
I'm on the paper man chase, fuck these hoes
I'm taking pain pills, my heart is moving slowly
All I know is hustle cause I hate being broke
And man, this money is not shit, these cars are not shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit
Quick work made me drop out of school
Smoking marijuana, riding tools with them
Hanging ‘round hustlers, thieves and fools
Hand in hand with strangers, looking from an angle
Praying for an angel, protection against danger.
Cause I've seen a lot of dead niggas that had a hit
And I already saw the couple of niggas come out of the rage
And never came back, green bills on them
And just because we pay, stress doesn't drop
Still thinking about the losses, winning never made them fade
With Gs dead and [?] In my mind
It hurt so much I can't do the shit I didn't do
To keep my niggas here with me, I swear that shit is killing me
I hope niggas feel me cause I know they're listening to me
And just because we smile and play
That doesn't mean everything is going well, no
That does not mean that everything is going well
My heart is so cold that I can never bend
And man, this money is not shit, these cars are not shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit
These clothes ain't shit, you know these hoes ain't shit
Help me, can you help me?
I have fifty bags of gasoline, can you help me?
I just cooked another brick, can you help me?

Skrt, skrt, skrt
Pick up your bitch and give her that skrr
Pull your bitch loose on that job

Murdered bitches, man, these murdered bitches
Keep that Glock 40, dare a nigga to touch my chain
I shoot this motherfucker like my name Max Payne
Help me, can you help me?
I just cooked another brick, can you help me?
Help me, can you help me?
I stopped at a Fisker and then at a Tesla
I thought this shit was sweet, I left her ass on a stretcher
I don't get feelings, I'm too busy taking death tolls
I'm a dog like Michael Vick
Michael Vicks used to sell them
I can't even lie, I've never sold a brick
But I have some partners who actually sold them bricks
Run to a nigga, better take some black shit
If your diamond is hitting, you could take a black bitch
I reached four hundred and went to buy a 'vette
Your diamonds so cloudy, who the hell sold you that shit?
You know very well, no, there is no Rolex fucked up
Get your damn money nigga try again nigga 21
The drug got wet, dried again
Pussy rappers ass telling lies again
Pussy ass, bitch ass fuck boy
Help me, can you help me?
I have fifty bags of gasoline, can you help me?
I just cooked another brick, can you help me?
I stopped at a Fisker and then at a Tesla
I thought this shit was sweet, I left her ass on a stretcher
I don't get feelings, I'm too busy taking death tolls

October '92 when you pushed me (Directly)
It was fair that I made a song about you (Straight up)
I can't say where I would be if I went without you (in God)
I wish I would have stayed at school, but I dropped out (About God)
You taught me to be strong, I have to praise (21)
When times got tough, you always made roads (in God)
Although I barely got the new Js (About God)
You made sure the boy kept a temporary fade
And you kept my playstation with some new games (straight up)
And you buy me freeze cups with your change loose (Facts)
My dad was never around, that nigga is too lame (fuck off)
I think that's why I dropped out of school and started shooting thangs (21)
My mom taught me to tie my shoes (in God)
Mom told me not to spend all my money on a jewelry box
I bought some real estate and am investing in my shooters (21, 21)
I had to write a letter to my ma dukes (Ma dukes)
I know you're proud of me, but I'm proud too (I'm proud too)
I'm still your baby even though I also have a son (directly)
I paid it, no mortgage or rent owed (facts)
Yes, she also got a Range Rover and a Benz (About God)
Ma, you never left my side and I appreciate it (21)
I saw you struggling, I think it left a scar (left a scar)
I did some things when I was young that broke your heart (broke your heart)
I'm the one who stole the cookies from the jar (out of the jar)
I went and stole the neighbor's car (the neighbor's car)
Times got tough, they started selling hard (Sell hard)
Before I see you stressed, I'm going to break the law (break the law)
I was selling grass, I never cut the grass (I cut the grass)
Commit a robbery and take it to the pawn (direct to the pawn)
When I went to YDC you were there (in God)
If I had an audience at school, you were there (that's a fact)
When you had the Ford minivan let me drive to Citi Trends
Baggy Girbauds and Some Timberlands (Straight, Straight)
You never chose a side, you told me: "Be a man" (Directly)
I'm going to raise my children, nothing like my father, I'm a better father
You are the best mom I could have (in God)
I had to write a letter to my ma dukes (Ma dukes)
I know you're proud of me, but I'm proud too (I'm proud too)
I'm still your baby even though I also have a son (directly)
I paid it, no mortgage or rent owed (facts)
Yes, she also got a Range Rover and a Benz (About God)
It's a difficult job, but women also raise men (21)
Ma, you never left my side and I appreciate it (21)

Blow your hood like Osama, dog
Wild young man with drama, dog
I'm still fucking niggas, mom, dog
Skrrt, skrrt, watch the pot scrape
I'm Betty Crock on cocaine.
Lily Rush with the cold case
I passed the hoe, for the sake of my brother
He knows I love them in the hoe face
I'm still falling on my old salary
Last year money, nigga, in my old safe
2013, that's an old Wraith
2017 is a new May
Hit your butt so many times you need a new face
Saint Laurent Don, this is not Burberry
Nigga, do you wanna be an obituary?
Get out of the car, because you're too scared
I give you a hot one, nigga, this is a hot gun
We don't stop shooting until the cops come
Yo basic bitch, bitch nigga face it
Broke bitch, hoe bitch
Hop club, chase dick
He told me to delete his number, I already deleted it
Yes, yes, what are you talking about, nigga?
Jump with that yoppa ', what a talkin' fight, nigga
It's raining, but KelTec brings out the sun, nigga
Got that Nick Cannon, I pulled the drum out, nigga
You niggas handcuff too much, and I'm too awake
You can't talk to me little bitch, you travel too much on the bus
They kicked me out of elementary school, they used to stoop too
I used to skip classes and go to school for lunch too
Nigga, fuck you, yeah, you too
And my fat bitch like Bruce, Bruce
I have a model bitch, she only eats couscous
Don't get me close to your socket, I hit them friends
Don't get close to your girl, I hit them friends
I ran away from your partner and I'm with all the smoke
'Another nigga of the Six, you little bitch
'Another nigga with the shit, you little bitch
It hurts when you suck the tip, little bitch
I think I'm slipping, it's on my hip, little bitch
Glock .40 ticks you up, you little bitch
Fukk 12
A hundred dollars and I'm drinking drop by drop
I hit for a hunnit 'and bought myself a drop
I stopped at her and the panties just fall off
Up to 32 shots and you niggas are gonna fall
Out with the top (head) give your block a fuck 1 2
High speed chase, shit about the cops
Niggas rappin ', I came out of the rocks
They tried to betray me
I'm mad at myself cause I keep it real with all these niggas
Niggas acting like bitches, niggas all in their feelings
These niggas act like women
Drowning in money, I'm swimming
These bitches act like pigeons
I just want a couple of million, I just want a couple of million
And I'm still true to the gang
These other niggas, lame
I really sold cocaine, the gas reeked of propane
Glock forty, nigga bang, Blood, Crip, nigga bang
I heard you got your chain taken and I had to get another damn chain
21 nigga the gang, kill your daughter the gang
Mac 90 has range, wild young man has target
I bought a new Rollie, it's simple, you niggas better stay in your lane
So let's screw all those bitches, I'll be a bunch of minions
Moving like I'm John Gotti, nigga shotty 12 gauge
Hit them in the body, I just caught another body
Lord forgive me I'm sorry I can't help it I'm a street black
I had to get some money, I saw my mom fight
Lord, forgive me, sir, forgive me, sir
They keep asking why I have that sword in my face (Tayman)
Lord, forgive me, sir, forgive me, sir
I just won another case
I just went crazy
New rollie with face
No face, no case
I had to lose a lot of friends, nigga try to chase them
Cooking crack is illegal, riding with a Desert Eagle
I'm a criminal, that's illegal, master bitch, she's illegal
Hunnid pounds reefer Cali, Call of Duty heat seeker
Pull up on a Regal, window down nigga crawling
Nigga rapping? I'm preaching, nigga, we ain't the same
In the trenches, meat niggas, I remember not sleeping
Hit the club and start squeezing, shoot for no reason
I lived like a devil, I lived like a devil
Now I lie down to sleep, I pray to the Lord, my soul to keep
If I died before waking up, I ask the Lord to take my soul
Lord, forgive me, sir, forgive me, sir
Lord, forgive me, sir, forgive me, sir
I just went and bought a Wraith
I freaked out on his face
New rollie with face
No face, no case
I met a new Migo, he said he had kilos.
I met a new Migo, he said he had kilos.
I met a new Migo, he said he had kilos.
I'm 21 years old, I stole all my plugs and He has no idea
He said they would land in a week or two, so be ready to move in.
A week or two passed, stopped with bricks
I look like shit, I'm Finna, be rich
I took a brick, took out a 9 and turned it back into a brick
I have clean drugs [?] Migo he just changed my life
If you stop with a hunnit, you might have to take his life
ManMan caught him in the back door, it seemed
Running away with niggas job, bitch, I'm with the shit
I'm a backstab but I'm really not with the cool shit
Million Dollar Lick
Million Dollar Lick
Million Dollar Lick
Million Dollar Lick
I just want to hit a motherfucker Million Dollar Lick

By licking a million dollars, you can fuck a bad bitch

Keep plenty of gunners
And I'm solid as a motherfucker, young shell, nigga without a turtle
All a lot hundreds and they blue
Whole and new lotta sticks
Nigga, what are you going to do?
When we have helicopters targeting them
Baby mom with you, she understands it too
Zone 6 niggas know how to shoot
Mally Mall, these niggas pass me the booth
Keep a lot of hundreds
Keep plenty of gunners
Slaughter gang top 5 crew, nigga pull up spraying rentals
Young Savage, real street nigga, and you meet a black representative who kills
And I'm solid as a motherfucker, young shell, nigga without a turtle
All a lot hundreds and they blue
Whole and new lotta sticks
Nigga, what are you going to do?
Pull up nigga, send some shots to your boo
Zone 6 niggas know how to shoot
Mally Mall, these niggas pass me the booth
Yeah young nigga hand me the scale
Young Savage and I fled on bail
The police say a nigga, will you say
Hundreds blue, black, keep me some bail money
From a young age I was in a hurry
I'm a young black boss, if it's not about the blues, it's not about anything
I can tell these niggas are scared by the way they talk
Golden Pyrex, I put diamonds on my fork
Pick up your block, white chalk
Bullet Skate Chopper, Tony Hawk
I'll cut your fingers off if you scream
Pop a perc, hit the cup, nigga pause
Bitches know I have that bag, Santa Claus
I drink lean and explode Xans
Poppin 'molly nigga, San-Tan
I want to fuck your best friend
I just bought a new Benz
Bitch, I came from below
We starved, we stole
Take care of your affairs, bitch
Take care of your affairs, bitch
Take care of your affairs, bitch
We're not with that friendly shit
That friendly shit
That friendly shit
That friendly shit
Catch them, roll down the window and smash
Another nigga tagged with toes lying on the grass
Five shooters on the back of the black Uber and ready to shoot
I tie my shoelaces, dive into that black bag and take a blue one
I'm the nigga from Slaughter King, I don't give a shit
You get some money, you get fame, these bitches are gonna come out of nowhere
If I'm snitchin 'a pop, wrong move, I'll drop it
.15 in my sock, stuck at the bus stop
It came from a nickel rock, now I have a complete block
Take care of your affairs, bitch
Take care of your affairs, bitch
Take care of your affairs, bitch
We're not with that friendly shit
That friendly shit
That friendly shit
That friendly shit
Catch them, roll down the window and smash
Another nigga tagged with toes lying on the grass

Seven-digit nigga, money all I talk about (cash)
You are not talking about money, what are you talking about?
Money talks, money talks, money convo

Automatic start of my whip before I dive in, let that bitch rumble

Bodyguards going through customs (Customs)
Both boys have guns
Because most of your friends can't trust them
Clout chasin '(Clout chasin')
Leave me the truth in the verse (Yes)
If you got paid to do it, you don't have to ask how much you are worth
If you rap for money, fool
This shit is not a milli ', this shit is a hundred
The wild industry and most of you average
I'm not afraid of anything static, I'm bustin, I'm bustin
He could be an addict, he's drinking that 'Tussin
He knows where you live, where you work, do you trust him? (No)
Power

Power
Money and fame make a monster
A monster (low blow)
She under the belt, that's a low blow (low blow)
She's going to try to blame YOLO (YOLO)
Niggas over here tryna rap beef (Rap beef)
I'm not giving any free promotion (No no)
Wife, he's a cop like Robo (Robo)
I'm gonna pass it on to the gang like Romo (Romo)
Finna shopping in SoHo (21)
Could you throw me in the middle of the ocean
I'm still coming out dry (dry)
You can leave me in the jungle with bears and tigers
I'm going out to fly (fly)
I will take the position for my brother
Put my hand on the Bible, I'm still going to lie (about God)
All the money in the world will not stop crying (directly)
Pain and hunger made a savage (savage)
Came from below, at a disadvantage ('Vantaged)
It's not about the money, you can have it (you can have it)
Shawty has a loot, I'll grab it (I'll grab it)
In the fast lane, try to dodge traffic (Skrrt skrrt)
But I've never dodged any static (in God)
War wounds, I have scars (21)
The teachers told me it would be nothing, but I went far away (21)
I could pay your salary for ten years with a car (21)
All the pain and all the fighting made a superstar (21, 21, 21)
Power
A monster
Power
Money and fame make a monster
Yes Yes
I lost all my friends counting bands in the Bentley Coupe
If she wants to dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I lost all my friends counting bands in the Bentley Coupe
Diamonds on me making hand stops, Rosé on my tooth
If she wants to dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need friends if you really want to know the truth
I lost some friends chasing money out of hand (in God)
Cause when the money comes, the niggas act funny (Right)
Crocodile bracelet, 21 Dundee
Your bitch skates so fast to the dick
Made from below, I'm a star (21)
Playing with the stick like a guitar (21)
Why do you have a 12-car garage? (Why?)
Because I bought six new cars (no lies)
I remember the times were dark (I do)
Now I'm behind the scenes with a bar (big dog)
Could not pay the electricity bill, it was dark (Yes)
Now I can glow in the dark (in God)
I lost a couple of friends, even though I'm not even really mad (by God)
Although I'm not even really angry (21)
Difficult to distinguish the real from the false
I lost all my friends counting gangs on a Lambo truck
VVS on me, fighting the ice like a hockey puck
If she wants to dance, let her dance, watch her lift it up
I don't need friends, what is a friend if there is no trust?
I lost all my friends counting bands in the Bentley Coupe
Diamonds on me making hand stops, Rosé on my tooth
If she wants to dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need friends if you really want to know the truth
I lost all my friends counting gangs and got a benz
Raised without an army, just the handsome one and I'm spending it
No, no, never lend it, that's all for me
I stay greedy with the dollar, no apologies
All these men with their fucking hands, trying to save a little
I never stress, no, I have a lot of weight
I've been alone, alone in my new mansion
Everyone says I became a ghost, jump in my ghost
Paparazzi always try to pressure me
Since I exploded, I don't know anyone (I don't know anyone)
Yeah I blew 80 bands just to get you to go
Hey, I know somewhere that my mom prays for me (for me)
If she wants to dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need friends if you really want to know the truth
I lost all my friends counting bands in the Bentley Coupe
Diamonds on me making hand stops, Rosé on my tooth
If she wants to dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need friends if you really want to know the truth
I lost all my, I lost all my
(I really want to know the truth)
Hears
Bloodshot eyes, I'm smoking moon rock
You're going to suck on this dick until your jaws lock (jaw lock)
If it's not a bag, then my call drops (Call call)
I put my baby mom on call blocking (call blocking)
Ten golden chains like I'm King Tut '
Funds and deposits, I received paper clippings (I received paper clippings)
By a ratchet stripper with a fake butt (fake butt)
When I buy a Gucci shirt, I also get the hat (Get the hat too)
I'm just another nigga out of the trap, foo
I bought that bitch a bag so she can hold my MAC, foo
Crossing the street in my ghost ghost (in my ghost ghost)
Baby mom stumbling so I hit the hoe (I hit the hoe)
I went to the park to go sell a deuce (sell a deuce)
Blue lights behind me, damn, who can it be? (Who could it be?)
Woo, woo, the Cal County Police
You gangsters on Instagram, you are not difficult (it is not difficult)
Red flag tied around my extendo
I was fifteen years opening doors
All these fucking shows put my fat pockets on (My fat pocket)
Slaughter Gang, killing like children of anarchy
Your main bitch, she's gonna suck my skin (Skin off me)
I bought a foreigner and he yelled at me some dye (Dye on me)
She will ride it like a motorcycle
She will ride it like a motorcycle
She will ride it like a motorcycle
She will ride it like a motorcycle
She will ride it like a motorcycle
She's gonna ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle
Bitch, I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I'm leaning over, baby, not NyQuil
And I can't stop it, keep going, baby, don't stop it
A hundred thousand hairs in my pants, money piling up like ants
And I can't stop it, keep going, baby, don't stop it
I can't stop it, a hundred thousand stuffed in my pocket
Raise a nigga with a rocket, if I take it out, I'll blow it up
I call her life on a bicycle because she is riding, without stopping, she eats her pussy and then a black man blows it up
Finger licking good like shrimp and teriyaki
VVS diamonds got my watch playing hockey
You know I'm a whore, I will fuck your crew
Yeah i'm such a dog pull a rarri with the top fallen back
1017 need to bring back the wop, when I get into that baby pussy I can't stop
I love it when I see them nipples through the top of the crop
Butt crack showing on them G-Star jeans
Make a nigga want to go and buy him a ring
She is going to turn a black into a demon, she is going to make a black kill the scene
She is going to hold my drug when I am in need, she is going to rescue me when I am in need
She's gonna ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle
Bitch, I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I'm leaning over, baby, not NyQuil
And I can't stop it, keep going, baby, don't stop it
A hundred thousand hairs in my pants, money piling up like ants
Put the money in the safe, you could beat it like a case
I've been waiting all day, so I can put it on your face
Get up, you know who to call to rescue
Got a bad bitch, meet these niggas they gon 'hate
I can't stop making money, bitch, I have no brakes
If a nigga fights his bread, it's going to his head
Not enough kush, he'll be rolling like dice
Show him who the business is now that he wants to throw away the rights
He'll pay for that if I give him a price, fuck with my guy boy, you know you're not right
I know your bitch hasn't had shit
It's Dreezy and 21 Savage
Yeah, a million dollar nigga blows the money like a whistle
Take me where I want to order meat from the menu
Hard-headed nigga, I know she's holding a gun, if you buy me a ring we can make this shit official
I know when you have to run business you know I'll be here waiting for you when you're done
Let's get it
She's gonna ride it like a motorcycle, throw it back baby recycle
Bitch, I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle, I'm leaning over, baby, not NyQuil
And I can't stop it, keep going, baby, don't stop it
A hundred thousand hairs in my pants, money piling up like ants

Numb pain with money, numb pain with money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb pain with money, numb pain with money
Numb pain with money, numb the
Numb pain with money, numb pain with money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
It's a bag on your head, I'm going to pick it up
It was money in the house, I used to put it in
Dick riding, niggas always tryna pick it up
I'm not trying not to take pictures, bitch, I'm shooting Swishers
I count my butt and then I jump with that gun
If you are not sucking cock, you have an early exit
We have your wife on site, she tries to lick a pickle
I just bought a lamb and it cost me five cents
And I was platinum, still in the hood
And I take the gang with me wherever I go
Why do these niggas hate me? Man i don't know
And I have a hundred racks inside a Go-Go
And I get a hundred racks for a show, show
I wanna give my bitch my heart but I can't
I can't fall in love with a bad smell
And you know I love that good drink, ho
Numb pain with money, numb pain with money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb pain with money, numb pain with money
Numb pain with money, numb pain with money
Numb pain with money, numb the
Numb pain with money, numb pain with money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Sleep the pain with the money and I walk with that Tommy
And I put it in her stomach and made that little bitch ride me
You are my old school runner, you are my old school runner
But my new school works, it costs more than a hundred
Silly little niggas (21)
Make a diss song, they'll wrap you up like a mummy
My young niggas geekin 'on the start like zombies
They are hungry, on top of you and then they say: "Run it"
I stole cars, I drove them like karts (done)
Niggas acting like bitches, got both sides (cat)
And I came from the sewer, I have no heart
And I'm straight through the gutter, I have no heart
Nigga when my brother was killed, I had to go hard
Put that helicopter on his face and then I Bogart
Niggas try to cross me, I don't get it
I'm just trying to take care of the family
And I'm drinking Codeine, not Brandy (21)
And I'm drinking codeine, I'm an addict
You go to jail, you can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him trying to keep up with fashion
And I'm very, very rich and I'm not bragging
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who would have thought it would make him rap?
I almost lost my life when I was trapped
Numb pain with money, numb pain with money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb pain with money, numb pain with money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb pain with money, numb pain with money
Numb pain with money, numb pain with money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
If Young Metro doesn't trust you, I'm going to shoot you

I'm drinking a cup of coffee but this is not Folgers
I know you're still mad at the brick that I sold
I cook a brick and went to buy a Rollsie
I'm playing with the rock like my real name is Hova
AK-47 still strapped to my shoulder
They niggas tote choppers like they niggas from Magnolia
I fucked another nigga's bitch
When you get money you can fuck a black bitch
The VVS diamonds I made flooded my wrist
You know it's hard here for a pimp
When you try to get this money for a brick
Reaching into your pocket feeling enlightened
Fuck I'm running away with the niggas shit
All the codeine and the money spent
You had bands now you don't even have a zipper
Damn, you better take some black shit
Take the shit out of a nigga, better take the shit out of a nigga
I just took the shit out of a nigga and flooded my wrist
Rappin 'ass nigga, you're not really into shit
You have never sold Coca Cola and you have never licked
Man, we stop like the Secret Service, nothing without sticks
Mess with 21 Savage, they'll put you on a list
When you try to get this money for a brick
Reaching into your pocket feeling enlightened
Fuck I'm running away with the niggas shit
All the codeine and the money spent
You had bands now you don't even have a zipper
All your boys fucking your bitch
Damn, you better take some black shit

Dirty soda like Diana never cleans
My ex asked me, "Where are you moving?" I said, "Towards better things"
Let's not discuss it, man.
OMG, niggas sleep, I'm not tripping, I let them sleep
I'm not stumbling, let them rest in peace
I've been in the crib with the phones turned off
I have been in the house without answering calls
I'm done making the move, my shit is gone
In all six cooking with the movement of the wrist.
Curtains closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I have to shine this year
I could never disappoint the streets
I have not left the condo in a week
10 bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's not discuss it, man.
OMG, niggas sleep, I'm not tripping, I let them sleep
I'm not stumbling, let them rest in peace
I've been on a mission, I haven't left the condo
I get free Jordan boxes as a game for North Carolina
How much do I do with the deal, how the hell should I know?
All my watches are always eternal, you can keep the diamonds
Take a movie, I look like Meechy, I look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Then I got back on my worst behavior
6 God, put both hands together, it's an incredible grace
6 God, selfish with love, I need all the praise (woo)
They made me feel like him again (woo)
Yes, I yell at Nike, check everything
Let's not discuss it, man.
OMG, niggas sleep, I'm not tripping, I let them sleep
I'm not stumbling, let them rest in peace
I've been in the crib with the phones turned off
I did the step, I got my shit
In the 6 cooking with the wri-wri-wri-wri
Who else really tries to mess with Hollywood Cole?
Although I'm with Marley G
I'm trying to tell you something you should probably know
This that the Bollywood millionaire flow Slum Dog and uh
My true friends never heard from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers in the mirror for me
So I choose and I choose, I am not confused
I have a small circle, I am not with different crews
We walked the same path, but put on different shoes
We live in the same building, but we have different views.
I have a couple of cars, I never lose
I don't like my single women, I like my girls two by two
I live fast, I die young, never take it slow
Tell your girl to tell a friend it's time to go
And tell me the weather today
I know they say they are good, but trust me, I'm better
I sound like the coldest night in Miami
I'm cold but I'm still hot, you can't pick a sweater
Really is whatever
I'm murdering and this is so much fun
If they are something worth seeing, then I am an illusion
I'm telling you I'm the baby man, what's the confusion?
And if they're still sleeping on me, someone hit the nap
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I feel
I am drinking
These London streetlights have a real glow
Dizziness while playing fast but feels slow
And ask your man, he's an enemy, baby, he doesn't know
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal
This here was meant to be buried
I am not lying to children as the dentist is not scary
But I'm not playing high school games
Pullin McLarence via a McDonalds lane road
I'm going to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra
Blades cutting through city streets, liquid swords
I do better than best
You know what it is, Drake and Tim Westwood.
Yes Yes
Boomin 'in South Gwinnett as Lou Will
6 men like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along just like me (Lou)
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I'm in Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No shit, no shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no body of shit, I run my own shit
I told you, I thought I told you, you didn't listen to me
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like MacGyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill races and turn off the lights, this shit is scary
Young man, but I'm making millions to work the night shift
(Work, work the night shift)
Young but I'm getting every damn thing you owe me
You have to know
I'm here to fuck with the souls of blacks, my heart is cold
It's prolific because I'm from the snow, with all my problems
I know they want to see me go, I'm on a streak
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
I'm not your boy, I'm not your friend, don't show love
I could go to DeMarcus Cousins in public
Man I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't make this fucking tape for CNN
I'm not trying to win prizes, that shit seemed forced
It's nothing like this
Young man, but I'm making millions to work the night shift
I've been or who I saw or
What club did I go to with friends?
Baby don't worry you know you got me
I am in or whom I saw or
Baby don't worry I know they caught me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (No)
I have money from the car, new money
I want women to cry and pour their hearts out for me
And tell me how much they hate when they part with me
Tell them I love them and I never mean it
That shit is dangerous, but it's so convenient I don't lie.
Yes, and I feel comfortable
That Ferrari Italia manual is shitty fly
He's sitting in the house like I bought him in '96
Too busy, too busy, damn
This black girl, but for me she was not
It was hot before they opened doors for me, oven preheated
My new daughter at home had problems with parents.
And some charges, how the hell can I take her to Paris?
Luckily I am the best my country has ever seen
So it's likely that I will get to the border to issue my authorization
Dreams that money can buy
That's just because I've been waiting for you, nigga
So fuck the one who hates a nigga
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (No)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (No)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (No)
We talked about music for hours, she never mentioned you
YMCMB
When I know part of their envy
I take them off at home because the rugs are Fendi
Oh! I never saw the car you say you drive
Or, shit, I saw it; you're just not inside
And I feel like lately, it went from the top five to the remaining five
And they try to bring me down, me, Weezy and Stunna
We stay awake, Christmas lights in the middle of summer
Then I'll probably give you my number
Yeah i throw my dollars up high
And they land on the stage where you dance
We have company coming
They told me it's like a straw, and it wasn't a lie, yes
Just have a nice pussy waiting for a nigga
Oh yeah
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (No)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (No)
Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me (No)
Not
Not
I am in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay
So if you chastise me for working with someone else on a pair of Vs
What do you really think of the black that is making it beat?
I've done things for him, I thought I'd never need
Father had to stretch his hands out of me.
Pop style for 30 hours and then I let it repeat
Now you show up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just went for all of you putting the pen on the sheets
Tired of sitting quietly and helping my enemies eat
Maintain temperature checks
They know my head is overheating
You must have had your infrared wrong, now your head on the beam
You are all the living image of any jealousy that is generated
You're not even the top 5 when it comes to your tag talent
You send shots, well I have to challenge them
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold it back because it makes me nervous
You niggas leeches and snakes
I think it's good that teachers are learning now, yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then he, then you
Don't be ashamed, there are many niggas who do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable guy
Man, you could have sold college students for Nike and Mercedes
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that is a lot like what has happened lately
Please believe that his death will be televised, yes
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a few times
Nigga was at Kroger working double
You all act like he made the boy when he was trying to help the boy
Yes, who gassed you to play with me?
Man you made this shit as easy as the alphabet
Who supposedly hits me
I really shouldn't have given you any of my time
Cause you're older than the nigga you're running after
Look, holla to me when you're a billionaire
I told you to keep playing with my name
And I'm going to let it sound like Virginia Williams
I'm too tough, get your feelings out
It will be a cruel summer for you
Tell him we send you an invoice
Considering that we have just sold another 20 for you
Sincerely
Duppy
Yes
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (slow)
She tries to take it all away from me (Tryna take it all away)
Tryna stays very close to me (She tries to stay very close)
I can't play, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Railiza (Ow!), You need a ... money and visa
And you get what you want, always from me
Howisha, you need a ... (Ouch!) Baby with me, huh
I can't say "No" when you say "Please", I can't say "No" (Ow!)
You want a supermodel pose like my true friend Winnie (like my true friend)
Yes, the holidays are over, but I'm not done, no.
You can't drink all day if you don't start in the morning
Lord forgive me, I can't take things slowly (slow)
I'm gone with them once I get going (Gone, Gone, Gone) (Ouch!)
She tries to take it all off (Close) (Tryna take it all off)
Tryna stays very close to me (She tries to stay very close)
I have to catch myself (I have to catch myself)
I can't play, I need to take it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
I bet I never disrespect you, baby, huh
I beg your pardon, darling
I see you wandering, riding
Yes i see through your body
She says I am the youngest, but I treat her best.
She tries to take it all away from me
She tries to do it with me
She tries to stalk young darling
I plan to fuck all the girls in the world, but I'm taking it
Easy, easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, mm-mmm
You know i hit you
Even my principal knows that I have something for you
I walked in a hallway, any day for you
I'll go low maintenance for you
Jump when you say, like a kangaroo
Crying for you, and it's nothing new
We dance drunk, then we jump
She presented a gift with a fucking face
I'm trying to fuck all the girls in the place, but I'm taking it
Easy, easy, windy, easy
Easy, windy, easy, windy
Yes look
Me and Sos, we are from two different areas of life.
Mutually we understand that there is a problem, we do not speak with vice
That's uncomfortable ice sum
I never signed for a mill, but they offered me twice
I am very nice, letters that I often write
Inspire talented rappers to get off the mic
I flow as cool as fall nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin light
Fooling Drake, that's not entirely polite
It's a shame because that's how the business goes
Imagine if these other niggas fail and their hits
I bet I have a co-sign something like no time
They'll be trying to sub a nigga like Quizno's
All I need is some weight, my scale, some bail money
A small cabin in the club for the entire poster
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird in E
I need my moms, my dad, a bottle of cliqua
Something quick and I'm a good man, I'm easy to please
I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where guns explode and child molesters brought out candy
So I never had a chance to escape
Fast forward to '07, nothing has changed much
The D still reaches deadlock
And the microphones aren't really much bigger than roaches.
And I told the same damn sad story, different post
D boys jugglin ', single mom fighting
The media try to cover it up
But the two-layered Cottonelle in your neighbor's house, I'm in another shit
Drake and I from two different walks of life.
My left arm is like David Wells
My right arm is like Holliday, so I'm probably looking at 8-12
Just throwing a bag of chips at one of my close friends
Shit I know they want me locked up
All I need is some weight, my scale, some bail money
A small cabin in the club for the entire poster
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird in E
And something heavy on my waist, man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my dad, a bottle of cliqua
All the ATF you know who we are
Ayy, get up, get up
The only obligation is to say it directly
So much on my plate I have to delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we have to celebrate
I'm in bed awake, thinking how I did it
All of this happens for me and my family.
All of this happens for me and my family.
There's no way this is real, man, it can't be
(Yes Yes)
If you need me, you can't call me, I'm busy making money
You know what I have in mind, all I think about is the Hunnids
I'm busy with my business, friend
Slowly my mouth is going out, I don't know patience
I had a chance, so my niggas got it too like it was contagious
But I couldn't imagine being Champagne (Haan) when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't see the changes
When I was with Mrs. Creighton, that woman hates me
I couldn't measure it
I want to thank God for working so much harder than Satan
He's playing favorites, it feels amazing (yeah)
Raise, raise
The only obligation is to say it directly
Me and all the boys find a better way
This is a life bet that we can never separate
I'm in bed awake, thinking how I did it
All of this happens for me and my family.
There's no way this is real, man, it can't be
Georgie got me thousands of dollars for the weekend
My mood is changing this summer, I'll be tinkering
Ayy, taller
Ahhhhhhh
You have faith in me ...
Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all the time
I know the truth is that you won't love me until I'm gone
And yet what comes next goes on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Knowing all my heroes how to see how magic works
The people I admire go from bad to worse
Working in the land of the free, the home of the mighty
I have to bring my brothers or I will feel out of place
Breaking speed records on the roads these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's all written on their face
I don't know how I'm going to get out of here clean
I can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos tear and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are taking it to extremes
Leaving me in limbo to question what I believe
Letting me ask what is your reason for making peace
Leaving me not to trust anyone I meet
Letting me ask, is there someone like me?
You have faith in me ...
You ohhhh
You have faith in me ...
You, ohhhh, ayy
Wasting my years
There are times when I wish I was where I was
When I used to wish to be here
Wasting my days
Scroll through life and fish to praise
Stranger opinions take me out of my way
Most of the time it is someone who is a minor
That's probably lonely and scared
And lash out so someone else can feel their pain
I always hear people complain about where they live
That all the people here are false and have nothing to give
That makes another city seem more exciting than it is
I know a girl whose sole purpose was to visit Rome.
And all he did was post photos for people at home
I know another girl who is asking for help
I know a girl happily married until she hangs up her phone
I know a girl who keeps photos of places where she has flown
To post later and make it look like it's still on the go
I wasn't hiding my son from the world
I was hiding the world from my son
Of empty souls who wake up and look to debate
Until you see your seed, you can never relate
Breaking news in my life, I don't run to blogs
They always ask: "Why let the story run if it is false?"
You know that a wise man once said nothing
I'm exhausted and exhausted, I can't even pretend
All these people go miles when you give them an inch
All these followers, but who will follow me to the end?
I guess I'll get to the end and then I'll find out
You have faith in me ...
Higher, higher
You have faith in me ...
You, ohhhh, ayy
Higher, higher
I have a hundred Gs in my line
I'm not eating Jacksons when I'm in Overtown
I have a smell there in the attic, that's a couple of pounds
New Rolex that I ordered, that's a hundred thousand
Time to milk the game, bitch I went and bought a cow
She slid over him with the stick, yeah, and sat him down
My nigga nut is so sneaky they don't stroke him
I got a hundred niggas on my line
One hundred squares at a time, nigga, hold it down
Addicted to money, addicted to potato chips
My hoe was gay, now she was addicted to cock
Addicted to this, addicted to that
I'm piling them up, it's more addictive than crack
I'm addicted to money, addicted to potato chips
My hoe was gay, now she was addicted to cock
Addicted to this, addicted to that
Alright, my patience is wearing thin
Cannonball bitch I hope your trampoline is tough
And I hope when dinner's cold my niggas won't leave me
Nah, but everything is fine
The agreement was signed and my division is fine
And these enemies pretend that everything is fine
Say that shit in person, man, I'd like to
Because my uncle was my father and my father was my nigga
I took the time to load the bullets, now I'm about to pull the trigger
Like boom boom boom I'm a genius damn
So sit down if you can't bear it.
But skinny told me to do
And don't listen to anyone who knows me
Because knowing me would mean that there is a new me
And if you think I changed in the least I could have been fooled
Yes, and to my city I am two-three
Drug dealers live indirectly through me
No bench time, nickname Starter-Drake
Franchise, I don't even have a break
And these other lame barely mentioned
But can you tell by my prop
Addicted to money, addicted to potato chips
My hoe was gay, now she was addicted to cock
Addicted to this, addicted to that
Lickwood means "rewind" and shooting means "forward"
You requested it, then we rewind
Yes, way, way, way
Upload everything, yes, look
I have a lot of people trying to drain me of my energy
Fucking with the boy and pray for your nigga
Fuck online, that's not part of my day
I got niggas that can never leave Canada too
I have two mortgages, thirty million in total
I got niggas that still gonna try to fuck me
I got rap niggas that I must act how I like
I have enemies, I have many enemies
Many people try to drain me of this energy
They try to take the wave of a nigga
Fucking with the boy and pray for your nigga
I bought this bag, I bought this truck
I bought this house, I bought this mall
I keep buying shit, just be sure to keep track of everything
I have bitches wondering about the code for the wifi
And show me pictures of your friends
I have strippers in my life, but they are virgins to me.
I have high hopes for you niggas, let's see
I got money in court until all my niggas are free
'About to call your butt an Uber, I have a place to be
Well run when you see me then and we'll see
I have enemies, I have many enemies
Fucking with the boy and pray for your nigga
Nah, fuck all of you niggas, I'm not done
They don't want to hear me say it's an opportunity
They don't want to see Win Win, 50 or Whoa
I have a few reals living beyond Kennedy Road
I have true me everywhere I go
I'm trying to tell you that I have enemies, I have many enemies
Every time I see them, something is wrong with their memory
Tryna take the wave of a nigga
So tired of saving all these niggas, Mayne
Many people try to drain me of this energy
They try to take the wave of a nigga
Fucking with the boy and pray for your nigga
(I'm out of this)
Connor Shell:
You are so expressive about how much you care about your hometown of Toronto and how much your friends and team mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel for your city. Can you give us an idea of what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision and that ultimate responsibility?
Duck:
Yes, I mean, I think for the past week and a half I've probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has tried to find out what his decision will be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by the stage of his life he is in. I don't think there is a better way to deal with that than how you just did it. I think if we can award him an award at ESPYS for his amazing essay writing, I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he did was patriotic in his own way, he was brave and it was fair to me. I think it will be one of the most historical things of our generation.
I am honored to meet you and I am glad that I have come, without play on words, to witness this moment with confidence. I think it is an amazing thing. In fact, I woke up late today, so I'm catching up. It is a great feeling for me. I can't wait to end this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am that he's been a friend of mine for a long time.
Shell:
Obviously, you've joined Saturday Night Live and we've had Justin Timberlake as host of the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to ESPYS than we've seen in the past?
Duck:
I think obviously one of the talents that I can bring to ESPYS is music, but I'm going to get there and want to prepare a great night for the people. I think we have prepared an amazing night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music, but I'm not there to do a strictly music-based program. Yes, we definitely have some amazing prerecordings. Yes, I think it will be a great night overall. I am there to offer an excellent job of hosting.
Shell:
What makes the ESPYS host perfect? We have seen amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an artist?
Duck:
Well I think what makes an ESPYS host perfect is someone who can fill the room with energy and joy for the people in the seats. But I think the most important thing I bring is the fact that I feel like I know the room better than any other host before me just because I have a lot of these guys that I have personal relationships with. I think I will be able to take advantage of some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also by the athletes I don't know.
For me, it's just about getting to know the room you're in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an amazing night they deserve.
Shell:
In organizing a sports awards program, what do you think is the role of music in sports?
Duck:
Well, I once said in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us when it comes to musicians and athletes. I think when I talk to any of my friends who play sports they always like music, be it rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I will obviously never achieve was going to college and being drafted and playing in the league, so I think they are synonyms like that. We inspire each other and I think that is what really unites music and sports.
Shell:
This is a question for the producer, and if possible I have a follow up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the highly successful decision for ESPN, was there any real attempt to get your ad slated for ESPYS? Has anyone approached? You were close?
Maura Mandt:
No, there was no attempt to make that there. And with the decision, it was not something we were looking for for that ad to be on ESPYS. Certainly, if LeBron wanted to advertise on ESPYS, he would happily have had it there. I think ESPYS is about the world of sports unfolding throughout the year, and then we found the right person to help put that into perspective, and that is what you are looking for for the host.
Shell:
Drake, in the monologues, the presenters usually receive hits from the audience, and many times in hip-hop that is also part of rap music and always has been. Do you see similarities to the jokes on stage, either metaphorically or directly in hip-hop?
Duck:
I think it is a fun question. I think it fits well. I definitely think hip-hop is a bit more malicious than any host is looking for. I think we're not trying to end people's careers or make people feel bad in any way, and that's what hip-hop issues are most of the time about. So our night, as I said, is about being fun and having a good time with these guys and celebrating sports.
So yes, I think there is definitely a difference. Although being smart with words is being smart with words, that is an advantage that any musician or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a little bit different.
Shell:
Well, obviously I don't want to give the material away. But I have a growing affection for Skylar, and I'm not sure I can do it, but I'm sure I'll give you a gift if you enjoy my past references. I'm sure if I haven't already, now that I know you're looking for it, I could stick one in there for sure. You never know.
One of the things about ESPN and ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build-up. Today, I don't know if you realize this, but you have been the subject of conversation on social networks due to the photos that Chris Brown published. I wonder what you think about it and can you tell us what that means?
Duck:
Well, until the last end of the question, I prefer not to comment on it, but I know that our goal is obviously the night that ESPYS takes over the Internet completely so that everything we do goes viral and people to enjoy days or weeks later. I think the goal of anything these days is to have a life on the Internet. So I am excited.
Is Cleveland your new favorite sports city? How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins, Manziel and LB James in your ESPY segment?
Duck:
First of all, I would like to say that despite what everyone thinks on the Internet, I don't jump as a team. I've been in the past, I've always supported the player and not the institution unless it's the Kentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from. But what people have to understand if it is soccer, be it soccer or obviously basketball, I have many friends who play for many different teams.
So it's not that I jump as a team, I'm just a caring friend. With the recent news, of course I will go, of course I will go see games in Cleveland. If it wasn't for LeBron, who as I said has been a brother to me for years, I mean, we have three Toronto kids on a team, plus we have Manziel who, again, is part of our family and like a brother.
So I definitely have to look for real estate in Cleveland and maybe take some trips this year. I may have to spend a month of the year there and watch my boys do what they do best.
But yes, as I said, my teams will always be who they are forever, but yes, I will support the group that has moved to Cleveland. I think for Cleveland, a place I've been touring over and over again, I think it will be a greeting. I would really love to see that city grow because they are just a support group, and it is a great place, so I am very excited.
Shell:
So ESPYS is your second presenter concert this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So are you hosting something that you're trying to do more of or are you just working on more music? You have a lot to write about now that you're single again.
Well, actually, my status hasn't changed, just to clarify. I've always been here out of inertia. But other than that, ESPYS is my primary focus as SNL. When I commit to something, I don't let my focus drift.
So for Maura to give me this chance to host, I don't take it lightly. I put everything on hold to give the best possible performance in this awards ceremony, and from there, I have things to come, be it the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne, which is a true thing that many people do not know if it is real or not, but it's very real and it's going to be very competitive. And then from there, I will discover the following steps for myself.
I'm always working on new music, but ESPYS is the main focus right now, and we'll find out what's next.
Shell:
One thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is that you are a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved Katt Williams and Lil Wayne. With having so many friends and being friendly to people in the audience, can we expect you to reveal any impressions during the show?
Yes, I am really excited to say that I have definitely incorporated impressions into my acting, and that is something that I am really proud of what I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character, especially if I know the person or know their gestures or if I can really study their gestures. So yes, I will be making impressions during ESPYS, and they are good. I'm excited. They're great.
Shell:
Do you bring your lint roller?
Oh yeah. I think you probably have it somewhere. Maybe I should. I should take it out on stage. You shouldn't have said it on the call. You should have sent that suggestion anonymously, maybe we would have used the prank. No, I think I won't have any lint that night. I will have a stylist and hope there is no lint on any of my outfits.
So we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning to wear the same fashion with any Calvin Klein suit, and what stars are you in terms of the sports world, are you looking forward to what they will wear?
I'm not exactly sure what brands I'm going to use. At this moment I am still, as I said, very focused on the program. I will find out what the suit will look like next week and what particular designers I will be wearing. But I'm more excited about the costumes and the kind of athletes that will wrap me up for everyone to admire. So that's really my main focus, but I'll put my suits together.
I'm also excited to see what the athletes wear during the show because that may be a joke in itself. I could cut myself off with someone and I won't have to say anything.
Shell:
Duck:
Well, I mean, I have received many good wishes from my friends. You know, one of my mentors who is not an athlete, but obviously Jamie Foxx, a previous host and a great reason why I asked to be a part of this, just because of that performance he gave, I think he hosted two or three times. times, oh, twice, right. It was inspiring to me for many reasons because of how he incorporated music, but how fun it was and how dominant his presence was. So, your mentoring and advice has been great to me. Is there someone I hope to meet with?
I mean, yeah, I was going to say I never met Skylar. I am sure it will be extremely uncomfortable when you do. But I guess that would be my answer if he does make it, which he probably won't. Her boyfriend will probably tie her to a chair or something. But yeah, if I ever meet her, I probably owe her an apology right away. Everything has been in a good mood. But yeah, that's the only person I'd like to meet.
Just for that last person, I also want to meet this guy who says he lost because he heard my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and evaluate him and then cut him off. Yes, Nick, whatever your name is, because you didn't win, that's how you will be remembered. Nick what's his name.
Shell:
Can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing the awards and how many of the ideas come from you and how many from the writing staff? Also, if you think writing a joke is more difficult than writing a song?
Duck:
Oh, very good double question. Well, for the first part, the collaboration process has been absolutely incredible. We have a great team, from obviously the main boss, Maura, to the writers and everyone involved. It has been amazing working with everyone involved. We've been at this now for three months, I think, just once in a while, meeting and talking and a brainstorm. As for the ideas that are mine, I am very happy and proud to say that many of the ideas that I presented are what I am going to present or deliver on Wednesday night. Whether it is music, jokes and recorded pieces, I participated a lot in contributing what to deliver and how to deliver it.
Is writing a joke more difficult than writing a song? I think, because of the way I write the songs, which is very honest, a raw emotion about my life, I think writing a joke becomes a little bit easier for me because it's a little bit more joyous than your melancholic Drake song. average as the public would consider it
But yeah, I mean, all my music is so honest that sometimes it's hard to take advantage of that and be so honest with yourself. When you can be happy and joke, I enjoy it. It comes a little faster than the songs.
Mandt
I would like to comment on the collaboration process. After working on the show for several years, one of the things that really resonates with the content is when it's authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have access to Drake from the first time we met and talked and had his opinion on what is happening with the things he wants to do and that we can go back and contribute and make them come to life, really elevates him, so he's definitely It has been a process of collaboration on your part and participation.
We had a session the other day from one of the skits, and something happened to him on set, and you guys will watch it and know what I'm talking about when you watch the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It really was like a jam session, and it was one of the best things to see. I am really excited for everyone to see it on the show.
As if real music didn't always win the Grammys
But we are fine ...
Honorable mention works for me and you
Honorable mention, hey, hey
You're lucky LeBron finally had to lose
Yes, the season is over, just wait, you're going home
I can't deal with life's obstacles like you're Lolo Jones
Are you ready
Iggy Azalea and Swaggy P
You know what I'm talking?
Collin Kaepernick you know I love to see you flexing
Too bad Michael Crabtree can't catch him
Danica, you don't always come first, we know
But somehow in Nascar you are the only face we know
Honorable Mention
Honorable Mention
Didn't win, didn't lose
And now the whole of the United States of A are also soccer fans
Receive an honorable mention
But even in Brazil, inspiring dreams don't always
Come true
Yes
Yes
Oh you have to love him, oh you have to ... oh you have to love him
I heard what was circulating, let's go to the bottom
I told 1st to send me something and I covered it
Somehow I always rise above
Why do you think I have my head in the clouds on the cover of my latest album?
The game is all mine and I am very possessive
Lil Wayne couldn't have found him a better successor
Every shot you see me take, they all dispute
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Not to change shit, just to feel a few things twice
28 at midnight, I wonder what's next for me
Longevity, I wonder how long they'll look for me
I'm proud forever if I stay in my zone
I talk about this generation, but I can't change it alone
That is a platform that you chose, you should have kept it inside
Oh did you try It's so childish to say my name on the world stage
You need to act at your age and not at your girl's age
Oh you have to love him, you have to love him, yeah
I know rappers who call paparazzi to come find them
To show off their outfits, I guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music what I did
I prefer to give that 15% to the people I fuck
If Future and I hadn't done it with this rappin '
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel like enemies hate my trust
They scream my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And the stories about my life hit the net like bad service
The bitter women I am overexciting are with premenstrual syndrome
Crazy this year, fucking with my image
I've tried to reach young people so I can save them this year
Fuck it, I guess I have to wait until next year
And I heard someone say something that really caught me
No one seeks anyone
Instead of being someone who does the news, so everyone can tweet about it
And four weeks later, nobody talks about it
Damn I just had to say my part about it
But they were afraid of the truth, so going back to me showing me in public, that's a hot topic
I've been flogging mercedes and nigga trying to budget
I have to go back to Memphis to see my cousins.
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, South America
Part of my inheritance, forgive my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's the flow back
I'm with a girl whose ass is so big it's partly embarrassing
But fuck all the blushers and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgment
Shit is getting so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove I'm number one over all these niggas
Being number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated the music, nobody sees us
Winter is here, but somehow I'm warming up
I've been watching the game and I feel like I've seen enough
Let's drop a ribbon on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah boy you rap like you've seen it all
"Best I Ever Had" seems a decade ago
Oh please relax, where's the love and the peace?
Why do you rap like you're coming from the streets?
And I'm never afraid to put a little blood on my leaves
Phantom slipping like shit just hit a puddle of fat
Special order for anyone who comes for me
Shit, you'll probably shiver if someone sneezes
You see, they gave me back talking like we were only 40, Oli and I
Cutting all the loose ends, I'll be the barber for free
I'm almost four minutes out of the rhythm
I feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the fabric on the seats
Man oh you gotta love him yeah
And besides that, it is increasingly difficult to eat
Rappers demote houses, put cars on lease
Thinking that the labels said they would have trouble promoting me
And now it's everyone else who gets hard to believe
But, man, oh, you have to love him (Oh)
Yes
And from head to toe, I'm covered in Prada (Whoop)
I know your girl well, only not in public
Young black man in town
Yes i have to love him
* Laughs *
Yes
Damn V-O, sounds like you got a lot of niggas mad at you bruh. I guess that's what happens when an R&B diva tries to live the life of a rapper. You know what I'm talking. But um, if you really want it with me, I have you, I'm going to show you what it's like to be exposed, I hope I'm in the key, hahaha
The V-O-Y I'm talking to you
And they both record deals that never happen
OK Voyce, we know you were a snitch
But you don't get your kids back like this
You still need a ride, they don't pay you
And Taj caught you in those buds with shades of pink
OK Voyce, I always knew you bitch
But I don't know that you got off like that
I hear you making threats, you need to kill the jive talk
The furthest from bruh street, that's why I call you sidewalk
How are you going to knock me out like Snoop on a diet?
Uh, listen slim fast, we all know that
The only time you get on the shooters is in gym class.
This is not the day of the last judgment, today and later
This is a song from your sister's favorite rapper
Oh man ... I V-O man, let's remember a second man, we've been through a lot of shit. Like um, remember when, remember when you used to kick it in Jazzy's studio? And you used to make fun of Rahmel and say he looked so old that if you hit him in the face, his head could turn to dust. I remember that, and you used to make Diggs too manly and now you like it, standing next to him cutting records, I think that shit is funny. Ayo Boi-1da, do you remember the time he told us about um, hitting a guy in hey, what was the university, the man from the university, but actually, he stretched and had to call D10 to fix it [laughs ] Oh man. let's get back on track
Ho, I hope this ego you're in doesn't last, baby
Because everyone around you gave you gas money
We all had to give you elevators, wasn't it funny?
It's a real talk, you know better, I don't play that
But this is the same nigger who talks about a Maybach
And he can't move from his mom house in Ajax
Dawg, I mean, you just screwed up everyone, b. And that's a problem, man, I'm a loyal man. I mean, I remember when you told me that D10 would be better if she acted differently or if she wasn't going to take care of your children, damn it! You did shit on Sho, Me, Symphony, Andreena, Carmen, Lanny, Jazzy, Promise. Man, you made fun of everyone at Maxamus Melanie, Taj, Rahmel, Diggs. You said you were going to knock out ex. You even made fun of Boi-1da when I wasn't around. I mean dog, you are just an unfair cat man (it is what it is) and this is the commitment right here, sincere music, ho! Now man, Toronto. I have you for the next two summers, don't even worry. Yes, shout out to everyone I know, everyone who is with me and knows that they are with me. Waddup accurate, Jason Johnson waddup, Niko waddup, Janyelle I see you baby and I know you see Niko haha
Yes. Ho!
Do that dance do that dance
Special girl, don't leave me baby
Finding another one just like you won't be easy baby
So at least I know where the
Baby, just promise me that if you go, you'll come back
And when it comes to relationships, many are stuck
Somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score
It's been a long time since my brother has a tape in his car
Instead these girls take it raw
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safe to explore
So they dance to lure me forward and attack me
To the point that Drake compares me to Anthony Mackie
I tell you I'm not exactly engagement and romance
Because I hate waking up naked with a lady
Special girl, don't leave me baby
So at least I know where the
Baby, just promise me that if you go, you'll come back
Finding another one just like you won't be easy baby
So at least I know where the
Baby, just promise me that if you go, you'll come back
I don't get it, it's like my fairy is sick
All I know is that I can never find the love that Tyler Perry represents
I guess Shemar Moore is not all pure
Maybe I lie and it's like a little cure
I tell it all to her
I have to feel this feeling inside, it's something like that and I can't be so sure
Because really, what is a window without a car door?
Why can't I settle for one instead of all four?
My mind is clouded, this complex shit here
I don't want my daughter to make a song like Teairra Mari
So, I'm going to change, yes, this summer has grown
I'm running before I raise my own
Special girl, don't leave me baby
Finding another one just like you won't be easy baby
Baby, just promise me that if you go, you'll come back
Special girl, don't leave me baby
Finding another one just like you won't be easy baby
So at least I know where the
Baby, just promise me that if you go, you'll come back
Believe me baby, baby Stevie
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
Believe me baby, baby Stevie
D-R-A-K-Eezzy baby
So dance that dance that dance
Yes, because you are a special baby
Yeah pioneers
Drake, it's southern smoke
Please
D-d-d-d-damn, what did I consume?
Something spins fast or me or it's the room
I bet it's the room, because I don't use drugs
Or maybe it's that because I'm sure I have a buzz
Baby either way they throw me and I'm on a mission
So if your ears are virgin, I advise you not to listen
Because this shit is not kosher and this shit is not Christian
It's that damn heat you can find in the kitchen
Baby holla on your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay, maybe not, but I guarantee someone I know
We are all older and I have nothing to hide
And in this game I am a tide when the tides are small
Every record I've made, the station here is played
This is the city I run, this is the shit I created
They tell me it's me and I haven't even made it
I feel like I'm faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded
F-faded f-faded
I feel like I'm faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded
I just set the 40 ups, and got two forceful
I'm drinking lean, while you have fruit punch
I fade like clothes, I have been washed too much
Man, smoking with the devil raised me like an angel
Blow a smoke ring over my head, it's a halo
Wake up and bake, spend the whole day slowly
Head in the clouds, but my face falls
Ayo, I bought them percocets, do you want a percocet?
I buy cess ‘because every day I work with stress
Stop while I'm driving, it's like I'm a triyn to work on an airplane
And I smoke like a choo-choo train
So I stay discreet as Ja Rule's new name
And I can hardly walk, but everything is good and elegant
Man I'm so high I need a pilot to land me
Every record I've made, the station here is played
This is the city I run, this is the shit I created
Maybe I'm listening to things because I feel fainted
I feel like I'm faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded
F-faded f-faded
I feel like I'm faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded, faded
You are expensive, do you know?
I have a little high maintenance but not in a

On my way from the studio, undress
Let's do the things we say in the text.
Have you come all summer as a season pass?
I want to make you black
I want to see you work while I sit
Because you talk like you have what I need
You talk like you got the juice and the grip
Talk like you're betting everything on me

And now you come
Are you coming
I wet all the floors of your ego
I feel like I was running away
And you know I'm not going, I'm not going anywhere, nowhere
Because some of these things never change, no, no
There are many things on my mind and you annoy the times that I care
But we keep it much more, much more than, more than 100, we keep it 110
Show me what i have to do
I know you've been working, working, working, working, right?
You don't have time to rest

I'll make sure tonight (you cum before me)
And before you go (I need you to come)
It's not about me anymore (I need you to know)
Make sure (cum before me)
Part 2: Make sure
Get on top of me
We can still do this correctly
Put your hands up, pull your hair up
You're like a winning lottery ticket
Yeah you don't want to start with me
But you should, keep shaking it in front of me
Unless you are willing to do this publicly
You know, you know you're going to get comfortable
On the mat [?] With me
And I fuck you
So if you really screw me
Become as strange as you want, girl, it's up to you
And she hit me with that "I don't do this normally, but I'll make exceptions for you"
Let's see what follows then
And it makes a lot of sense now (I need you to come)
Girl makes a lot of sense now (I told you to leave)
You know I'm going to make sure now (I need you to know)
Make sure, make sure (run before me)
Make sure, make sure (I told you to leave)
You know I have to make sure, I have to make sure (I need you to know)
Make sure, make sure (run before me)
I have fake people showing me fake love
Straight to my face, straight to my face
I've been down so long, it seems like it's up to me
Admire me
I have fake people showing me fake love
Something is not right when we talk
Something is not right when we talk
It seems that you hide your problems
You were never really solid
No you can't "son" of me
You can never run me
Just when the shit seems out of reach
I come back like one, three
Like one, three, yeah
So they smile on my face
All the time they want to take my place
All the time they want to take my place
All the time they want to take my place
Yes, I know they want to take my place.
I can tell that love is false
How do you want to click after your mistakes?
Look you in the face, and it's not the same
I've been down so long, it seems like it's up to me
Admire me
Straight to my face, straight to my face
I've been down so long, it seems like it's up to me
I have fake people showing me fake love
Straight to my face, straight to my face
Yes, straight to my face, try to play it safe
The atmosphere changes like night and day
I can see it immediately
I went up, you changed
So they smile on my face
All the time they want to take my place
All the time they want to take my place
All the time they want to take my place
I can say that love is false (I can say that love is false)
I don't trust a word you say (I don't trust a word)
How do you want to click after your mistakes?
(That's just what I heard)
Look you in the face, and it's not the same
I've been down so long, it seems like it's up to me
Admire me
I have fake people showing me fake love
I've been down so long, it seems like it's up to me
Admire me
I have fake people showing me fake love
Straight to my face, straight to my face
Skrrt
Look how you speak on my behalf, you know?
Yes, it's Drake, KC.
Just smiling and talking
Then add to my surprise
I got lost in your eyes
This time they were different
And I found what it meant
After bending over, I fell helpless
Help me, I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where i think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
I think I'm in love
In love and I can't see
What is happening to me
You blinded my thoughts
From what the pain and the tears taught
Look at my broken hearts before
He no longer trusts in love
A kiss from you
I just felt myself fall
Help me, I've fallen in love
And now I can't get up
Somewhere between your lips
Is where i think my heart slipped
I tried to catch myself
Couldn't even have kept me from falling
I have butterflies, I can't control myself
I close my eyes at night and dream of you
It's true, I don't know what to do
Don't stop now
Since I let you in
You showed me how
You taught me to love again
And there is no reason why
I can't try (you know what it is)
Because it feels so good
He was the leader of my
You could say it was cool to a considerable degree
Leaving the house
We would never be together, is what they told us
From immature children to enterprising children
We buy our own dreams instead of the ones they sold us.
Keep it a hundred, why do they say I'm a liar?
Air the clothes, that's why I have a dryer
What are they looking for through clothing?
Calling them is a red rover for me
For them it is a dream, it is just a rare rover for me.
See I'm passionate and focused
I don't know what they expect a Scorpio born in October to be, but ugh
I'm going in, look
See, formerly mischievous behavior was the leader of me
You could say he was cool to some degree cocky
Leaving the house
Trying to figure out where the cheats' cameras would be
But now, I need a culprit
I'm talking all day shopping at the mall with friends I play with, here I meet the girl from T, go get some fall shit
Honey, I'm a runway demise. I will kill this song until I really die
With a military jacket and some supplies
I won't say I'm the best until the stats come
And all these parties from the list To the fraternizas
Where you can't wear hats inside, just pants and ties
But you never act surprised
Just hold it down for your child until the plates arrive
I fell down please help me
Because you know something is missing
I'm not supposed to make you different all the time
Because with all that recognition it is difficult for you to listen
To the things that I'm going to say to make you mine
But live girl, have fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself, I found one
Making a mistake that I never learned
I swear I always fall in love with your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type (yeah, oh, uh, oh)
I believe in people like you
Because who am I to judge you by the last girl
You say you're not like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down now
But it's too late because I'm already yours
You just have to promise me, hearts won't break
And end as before
See, the dress dangling from your shoulder barely sober
And you dance, you dance all high, like ballet and shit
Girl I'm on it
I've been on this road before and yes I skated but forget it
Dammit
I wonder why I never learn my lesson
It feels like a second chance and is the first impression.
Because man, it's been a while and I swear this is different
Let you meet my friends so they can give me a conference again
About how reckless I've been
And I'm slowly running out of time invested
Make the same mistakes
And I'm just trying to correct it, and I fall
Go, go, go 'head (Go, go, go)
Go, go, go, go, go, go head
Go, go, go, go, go, go head
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Uh, you're getting ready so I know we're going to be here awhile
Nail plates and files in the bathroom
Spend hours in salons on your hairstyles
At the mall accruing airline miles
Go to the gym, step on the scale, look at the number
You say you drop 10 pounds getting ready for summer
And you don't do it for the man, the men never realize
Smart too, ooh you're my love
I've always liked my women's book and my street smart
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
But they go with the clutch you wear your lip gloss on
And look, I really think no one does it better
I love the way you put it together, huh
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
You feel like it, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hairstyle done, all done ('Sup, girl)
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Well, aren't you a breath of fresh air?
Of all these shallow bitches digging for gold here
I guess they plan to suck cocks until millions appear
Now she plays these shoots like B.o.B plays the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having a few drinks at the bar.
Bare ring, M3 Bimmer
Champagne Range, Jaguar triple white
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louis and Bebe
You are not needy, greedy or easy like these other breezes
Who fucks for Riesling bottles and bowls of baked ziti?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You feel like it, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh?
Atlanta girls let me see your hands (yeah)
Shake 'em up at those bitches who hate you with their friends (come on)
Girl you got it let them know everything is great
Combed nails, all great
And my girls from New York, let me see your hands
Shake 'em up at those bitches who hate you with their friends (come on)
Girl you got it let them know everything is great
Combed nails, all great
And my girls from Los Angeles, let me see your hands
Shake 'em up at those bitches who hate you with their friends (come on)
Girl you got it let them know everything great
Combed nails, all great
And my girls TO, let me see your hands
Shake 'em up at those bitches who hate you with their friends (Yeah)
Girl you got it let them know everything great
Nails done, hair done - nails done, hair done
Say go to Cinderella, go to Cinderella
Devil in a tight dress, girl you're a killer
And there is no one more real, and there is no one more real, go
Go, go, go, go, go (as we go)
Cinderella about to lose the glass from her foot
And when I find it, it's when I find you
And we can do the things we never had the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm depressed for whatever it is, you're only leading the way
Let's have dinner, you don't even look at me to pay
And Jason had this Tammy girl in a purple Bentley
How did he get it, I'll never ask
Yes, but yell at the owners
The girls who got diplomas and enough money to lend us
A little something extra if we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
You feel like it, huh? Oh, you fancy, huh?
Nails done, hair done, everything did
Oh, you fancy, huh? (Luxurious)
Finally back in Toronto, it's better here
I just want to be anywhere but everywhere
I'm being lazy in the crib, I screw it up
I get enough exercise just pushing my luck
Sit thinking damn where they went
And now I see them picking up the pieces
I guess it's back to me like it always was
Me and OVO got as usual
A little money on the counter that I left for my girl
With a note I try to see the rest of the world
It all looked so amazing when we were growing up
I used to sit down and say I know someday I'll have a model
But all the money and the rap game slow down
And all hood models, Project Runway
Yeah it's whatever
You know
Feel good
Live better
But it is evident that nothing can prepare us for certain moments that you should only appreciate
As if this young woman had my letter tattooed on her arm last night
We take a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I ended up losing everything I came with, yeah
Yes, I still have ten years left, huh?
This is the only sound you have to fear
Man these kids wear crowns here and everything's fine
Lyrics will be available from launch. Stay tuned!
Littoral [?]
Pitches that don't twist
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Nails done, hair done, everything big
Nails done, hair done, everything big
You're getting ready so I know we'll be here awhile
At the mall accruing airline miles
Go to the gym, step on the scale, look at the number
You say you drop 10 pounds getting ready for summer
And you don't do it for the man, the men never realize
You only do it by yourself, you're the fucking coldest
Smart too, ooh you're my love
As long as they have a small class for about half a day
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals everything and heels hurt when walking
But they go with the clutch you wear your lip gloss on
And look, I really think no one does it better
She has it all together
She doesn't need to help anybody
She doesn't need you to take her
For some Gucci, huh?
For some Louis huh
She got the best of everything
Atlanta girls let me see your hands
Girl you got it let them know everything is great
Combed nails, all great
Shake 'em up at those bitches who hate you with their friends
Girl you got it let them know everything is great
Combed nails, all great
And my girls from Los Angeles, let me see your hands
Shake 'em up at those bitches who hate you with their friends
Girl you got it let them know everything great
Combed nails, all great
Shake 'em up at those bitches who hate you with their friends
Girl you got it let them know everything great
Say go to Cinderella, go to Cinderella
Devil in a tight dress, girl you're a killer
Uh, 5 and a half years old in boys, the ass is off the hook
And when I find it, it's when I find you
Better late than never but never late is better
I'm depressed for whatever it is, you're only leading the way
Let's have dinner, you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this Tammy girl in a purple Bentley
How did he get it, I'll never ask
I just knew it was fine as a ticket on the board
Yes, but yell at the owners
The girls who got diplomas and enough money to lend us
A little something extra if we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it
Why i do this shit
I think they call this "relief"
Look, this is me, the same
No self-adjustment, but you can feel the pain
I hope you know it's still the reason why I have fun
Fans think we all sign for a million
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
This is not how it works, this is not how it goes
And I've been taking drugs just to balance the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance my streams
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a black knows
And every time I try, it opens my eyes
These verses are an opportunity to be remembered and reproduced.
And I'd be doing this while I'm alive
Then every word I utter will be mine
Please don't be afraid of me, please don't be afraid of me
I remind you, this feeling is not new
So please don't be afraid of me, please don't be afraid of me
(Don't take it wrong but, huh)
I never cried when Pac died
And if my tears have value, I'd drop one
For every thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
And I'm going to be honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a group
Looking at the members of my team
Who is asked if they benefit from this million dollar scheme
I only know that I am indebted to you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families that this shit is not what it seems
But you are the reason for much of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And I know I blow bottles because I bottle my emotions
At least I exposed everything
Don't believe the lies, look me in the eye
I remind you, this feeling is not new
So please don't be afraid of me, please don't be afraid of me
Look fuck everyone, we ignore the feelings here
Yeah i swear we're doing murder here
But it's fun to have fans
Who finds you before someone has a chance?
And develop yourself, so you can be the greatest in the game
And notice when you're there, sometimes shit doesn't feel the same
Yes, and also things are just surreal at home
People think that I have changed just because my appeal has grown
And now security follows me everywhere
So I'm never really alone, I always feel lonely
I think I'm afraid of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now I'm used to those
Every girl I know thinks I'm fucking groupies hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think I have a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I smile
Although I'm living what you would call the dream
And my uncle isn't even texting me
It's funny how money can change everything
Don't believe the lies, look me in the eye
Please don't be afraid of me, please don't be afraid of me
I remind you, this feeling is not new
So please don't be afraid of me, please don't be afraid of me
I should be in the middle, whipping you on the way to you
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you told me
Who is it that has you all excited?
Changing your opinion about me
I only left for the past few months
But you don't have time to wait for me
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping and getting high with you
I had to let us go to show me what I could do
And that just didn't sit well with you
And now you're trying to make me feel on purpose
Now you're talking about my name, by the way, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young black man feel a way
Feel a way, feel a way, young black man feel a way
Instead of the opposite
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping and getting high with you
I had to let us go to show me what I could do
And now you're trying to make me feel on purpose
Now you're bringing it back to my face, by the way
Now you're talking about my name, by the way, yeah
And you don't feel anything, you think I deserve it
World, world, famous world
World, world, famous world
Yes Yes Yes
Yes Yes Yes
Feel a way, feel a way, young black man feel a way
I've stopped listening to the things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young black man feel a way
I've stopped listening to the things you say
Yeah I never really talk about the cock I want to give you
Or places I want to get to
Neck grip, hair grip
Back arch, myocardial infarction
I need it nasty like, like Evil Angel, like Vivid
You know, nasty how they give it
You know, I need you to be open like Kai's kitchen
That pussy sounds like pounding waves (Kshh!)
Calm down, keep it there, without moving
I walk the bases
To be honest, I really don't know what patience is
Zombie revival, this is not like you
This new you, this is not high school
I like it better when you have a fresh face and you have no base
Ready and ready for takin '
Smashing the earth, smashing earth
Scarf for after our relationships
No judgment is our fix
Put that face up if you dare
And the mascara rips to run
I always need a glass of wine at sunset
I hope the apocalypse is the only thing that doesn't come now, we are one now
Someone ...
Who would you say that baby looks like?
Duck!
Charged, my neck is frozen
Be careful when mixing potions
To deal with you the way you want
To deal with you the way you want
The way you like it (Woo woo, woo woo)
Be careful when mixing potions
You have options, but I was chosen
To deal with you the way you want
I'm more than a choice (hey, hey, hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (hey, hey, hey)
I took a chance with my heart (hey, hey, hey)
And I feel like he's taking over
Better find your love, better find your heart
Better find your love, better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing will separate us
I'm more than just a number (hey, hey, hey)
I doubt you'll find another (hey, hey, hey)
So every summer (hey, hey, hey)
I will be the one you will remember and ...
Better find your love, better find your heart
Better find your love, better find your heart
Better find your love, better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing will separate us
You listen, but you don't listen (Hey, hey, hey)
You better pay attention (hey hey hey)
And get what you've been missing
Better find your love, better find your heart
Better find your love, better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love then nothing will separate us
Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
I better find your love
I bet if I give all my love then nothing will separate us
I want my baby to have your eyes
I go against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can not decide
Fashion week is more yours than mine
I can't make a suit and tie
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt good
All the time, all the time, all the ...
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time (Yes)
Take some finesse
I saw you delicacy
Can't know the delicacy
You stay on my mind
You and your sister
Things would be canceled
I'd make time for you
Commitment
Crossing the distance
Take some finesse
I saw you delicacy
Can't know the delicacy
You stay on my mind
Dedicate, dedicate the world
Yes oh
I give you my fortune
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate
I dedicate to you
I dedicate, I dedicate, oh yeah
It only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the advantages of all this
But you go real with a pill and I like it
You only like my buddy, I just want to ride, fulfill all your wishes
(Yes)
I do not want to fight
Look, you know I'm a rider, there's nothing left to hide
Your other tired nigga
But I really don't buy it
Me? I'm moving in silence, all the things that we're trying
Tell me, should I remove these other girls from my life?
Because we never decided, tell me how you feel inside
You're a real woman and I like it, yeah
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I do not want to fight
Yes, yes, I discover you, you discover me
We are both a different race
You say: "A guarantee"
You never believe me
I told you I have Zs for these other girls sleeping on them
Girl i'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive
But you're a real ass woman and I like it
I do not want to fight
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate, I dedicate
I dedicate to you
This song is for you
I dedicate, I dedicate
This song is for you
Yes
I've been waiting for this Charlie, really
I've been waiting Driz
I've been waiting, let's go find them brother
Actually no
Yell Boi-1da too
Mm, I like that
Let's find them Driz
You don't have a drink, you're not drinking or what?
I have a drink brother
Hahahaha I like that
I have my drink right here. Greetings my brother
Toast man
Yeah ok yeah
Goldman Sachs, they want to hold my racks
Hedge fund investors talk to Adel like he's the expert
I hear it in his tone when they talk to him
We are very connected
Tom Ford's assistant texted me asking if I want a classic or a double
I flex with broad shoulders
When I walk the halls they move
The stories of how we handle ours begin to travel like a lone soldier.
I told you
You hug your girl the same way I keep my composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover
Silverstein dinners, all kosher
Never running
Dodge the sentences as if they don't want to discuss it, change the subject
I have Benny Yang chains rubbing, never tucked
Waiting to inhale
The things I own will be sold at auction as proof that we got it right
My house on a museum scale
The only skeletons here are from the nights I raised hell.
Get them to think twice about the stories they tell
I'm going to let them walk on eggshells
Wow, man like Drizzy Drake!
Yes
Put his foot on your neck man
What time is it? What time is it? It's like two in the morning right now
It's me and charlie, that's all, can you hear me? We have the whole building for ourselves
We have the building. Kill them again, kill them again Driz, kill them!
You all keep score while you watch me score
You guys keep the prizes, I'll take the rewards
If you're going to have fun, I'll stay and record
I'm living next to Michael, Bobby, Ralph, Johnny
My neighbors sound like a new edition
Those are these guys
We boys don't use New Balance or Levi's
Holding the Callaway club in my hand
Hitting balls from the balcony onto the sand
Tryna see where they land
Boy, this verse is the explanation of the big ego.
100 mill 'hands free like Ronaldinho
I'm going from Star to Venetian in a small speedboat with girls we know
Choose your option, Brooke or Tanya
Both of those little guys would leave their GPS on so I can find you
Fall place
Spring break travel, I'm on hot rotation
Drizzy Drake! You are a Drake animal! You already know that you are an animal! Animal!
I am cheeky!
I appeared for you, do you know what I say?
My brother drizzy
Wow. And you know how it is. You went out of the club to the booth to show everyone why you are the number one brother. Why did you put your foot on their necks!
Ayy brother, it seems like it's another time there, you know what? Like, I have to tell you this in the real brother. The way you embraced British culture will be remembered forever. And the UK loves you. The real G is around here, you know brother. When you go to your parties, you see who is at your parties
They are the certies
No, listen, but listen. It's a family and it's a big family, you know what it is. I'm happy to be home like I said man
My man brother. Foot in neck time
Are these guys silly? You see the great man Charlie too, oh my gosh
My brother Drizzy I can hear the prayers of these rappers, man
Nah, I'm hot for you right now
They say, "Hey, please tell Drizzy to take my foot off my neck!"
Nah, I'm hot right now, oh my god. Scream French Montana, my brother, do you know what I'm saying? The great wave, yes. Shouts Huncho, Quavo. Shout Offset, blessings on the new ting. Oh my God. Scream, I-. It could go for hours. Charlie come on man
Ayy, you could go for hours. I was at your party the other night, I saw who was there. I'm like, "Woah!" There are many people, there were many faces at that party
Yes, hehe!
And I'll be back from January to February, part two, you know what time it is. Come on!
Well well
Scream all the G's too, man. Yell at all male artists. Everyone from here doing their thing. I'm telling you Great inspiration London, England, come on man
Come on! You know I applied for your passport, right?
Hahaha. I need that
Money just changed everything
I wonder what life would be like without her
Of the concrete that I knew a flower would grow
Looking down from above and it's full below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
The truth about fame, you know I respect shameless shit
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly hugging it
Yes, and my dreams are who I'm running with
But you can see that I'm marking it so I'm always chasing it
Wayne put me here, it's who I get the role with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship.
Yes, this life is something I would die for
October but looks like July 4th
This time I'm really leaving, fireworks
Oh today begins
I have missed you before
But I won't miss them again
I still have the same dream
And I think I realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
I'm just a gentleman, you should leave it for me
See how I'm putting all my napkins and silverware
I realized it wasn't love, I just thought you'd screw me
Who could have predicted that Lucky Strike had caught you with me?
What happened between us that night? It always seems to bother me
Now all of a sudden these gossip blogs want to cover me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience
You could have been the one, but it wasn't that bad
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
You never see it coming, you can only see it go
Yes i should have looked at the sky at first
Now I can see it in his eyes, fireworks.
Oh today begins
I have missed you before
But I won't miss them again
I still have the same dream
And I think I realized what it means
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks
Every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like fireworks
Taking off like ... Oh
Everything is the same but it feels different
My dad called me knowing I still listen
And he still has his foot out, guilt shoots up
Really, me and my real estate agent, we created a better relationship
I have my mother in a place with a better decoration
How many marriages of our parents lasted?
Looking for that feeling, tell me where the magic is
Let's stay together until we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I never saw it close
Yes, but I think I have to find it first.
That's why I'm really leaving, fireworks
Oh today begins
I still have the same dream
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Every night is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
All I see is fireworks
Taking off like ... Oh
I want this shit forever, man, always, man, always, man
I'm turning off at the mall
And tell every girl that she's for meAnd I'm not even planning to call
I want this shit forever, man, always, man, always, man
Shit, nigga, this is what I do
This is my club, and I'm dirty in the summer, bitch
You don't know anything bitch, you better know who you fuck with
Try to fuck me, I'll kill you and who are you coming with
No homo, T, I had to become stupid
I'm in high cures, but I'm not Cupid
Hollands Avinue, riding homeless
In Mayback, 2 tones, and my rhymes are too brown.
I'm talking about my head, I make a blue-eyed bitch I just admire my red
I'm a Blood, motherfucker, a Blood, motherfucker
Forever like ETC peariods, well motherfucker
It may not mean anything to all of you
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, man, always, man, always, man
I'm turning off at the mall
And tell every girl that she's for meAnd I'm not even planning to call
I want this shit forever, man, always, man, always, man
I'm so unsigned, I'd go crazy
No bard holes, no lost love
So PAY, I don't think you'll find another nigga like me
This young black boat like he's selling a yacht
Who else tries to smoke, me too?
Why take my mind off the pressure, that's what Weed does
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a ski
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite, hoe or find the right dentist
I told Wayne that he was going in, like a life sentence
And I understand, I send shots to who is it for
I never had a mentor, yes, 10 4
It may not mean anything to all of you
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I'm turning off at the mall
And tell every girl that she's for meAnd I'm not even planning to call
I want this shit forever, man, always, man, always, man
Kidd Kidd!
You say I fell, I stay in the field
Since you can't fly, it knocks you off the ceiling, it flies
Like Pooky, grab a Dooky at a rap producer, throw trash out the window like Lukey
To a shark, you're just Sooshy
You are not difficult, cucci
Wally, Oochi, so this newborn booty
I say I move slowly, I just think fast
Look back, I'm not behind you, about to lick your ass
And I'm going to rest until my time is up
I'm the tech chef, my whole cut of beef
This ain't chorus, nigga, your choruses lyon
Because the only point you earned was one
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, man, always, man, always, man
I'm turning off at the mall
And tell every girl that she's for meAnd I'm not even planning to call
I want this shit forever, man, always, man, always, man
Too rich for whom? You all got rich again
Who grabs the microphone and likes to kill his friends?
I've never been the type to make amends
If the shit was an eight, we like it, we like it, we like it—
Yeah if the shit was an eight we'd like it to be ten
I don't like to talk when there is nothing more to say (True)
Drizzy 'about to fall, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you to listen to me, but we both know the end of the day
Your sister is pressing play, your coach is pressing play
Your wife, your wife, your wife, your wife ... (True)
I have to take a deep breath when I catch an attitude
I have a completely different level than I can take advantage of
Max said they only blessed when they joined you
The only dead beats are the beats I've been rapping to (True)
And the product is still the best
It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the man from the farm, I had to copperfield as swift
Voilà, tada (true)
Never a question of "could it?" Or should I? "
Kiss my son on the forehead and then kiss your ass goodbye
Luckily, I have established myself in my role as a good boy.
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, not sixes, rest easy, close your eyes
Wait, wait, but I ...
Miss Makin '' em pay
Heliport from Will Smith's crib straight to the stage
Three shows on the forum but I played Staples today
The neighborhood is full of smoke, they are kept safe in this place (True)
Drizzy 'about to fall, the game is in disarray
I'd tell you to listen to me, but we both know the end of the day
Your niggas are pressing play, your babysitter is pressing play
I had to go and press reset, now we are here
I've been on top for three series of three years
I can't fly if I could sit on the wing of that shit (True)
I try to pay less attention to it
They've been watching me like I'm paying next time
I think I feel a little scared from the other side
White vans parked across the street, very subtle types (True)
Yes, it's never about "could it?" Or should I? "
Kiss my mom on the forehead and then kiss your ass goodbye
Luckily, I have established myself in my role as a good boy.
I guess luck is on your side
All sevens, not sixes, rest easy, close your eyes
Wait, wait, but I ...
Hahaha, I can't argue with you, no! Are you crazy!
Look at you, you're crazy! You are very crazy! Hahaha
I am happy! Leave me alone!
I just want some money, a lot of money
I don't get paid to argue with you
Not! What are you You are nobody!
It may not mean anything to you
But I understand that nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm closing shit in the mall
And tell every girl that she's for me
And I'm not even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I have nothing to play with
Started local but thanks to everyone who hates
I know G-IV pilots by my first name
In your city it faded from brown, Nino
She insists she has more class, we know that
Swimming in the money, come find me: Nemo
If I was in the club, you know I made balls, chemotherapy
Who would think that a tour of the country would be the result?
Everyone has to deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm on my business
Kill all these rappers, I swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you haven't been a part of it, at least you have to be a witness, bitches
But I understand that nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm closing shit in the mall
And tell every girl that she's for me
And I'm not even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
Always, Mr. West is in the building
There is no doubt who is going to kill them
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I put my cock inside this life until that bitch came
And it was hard, everyone falls like ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Everyone saw my story, my glory
Now the super bad girls give me McLovin '
You might think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
Like they're down with the old me, no, you fucking weren't
Um, you're a fucking loser
He doesn't even go to class, Bueller.
Change Grammy plates, just to get my grandmother back
Remember I had that bad hip like a fanny pack
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They take out the cameras and, damn it, he breaks
I used to want this forever, everyone can get it back
It may not mean anything to you
But I understand that nothing was done for me
I want this shit forever man
I'm closing shit in the mall
And I'm not even planning to call
I want this shit forever man
Well hello, it's the Martians, the Space Jam Jordans
Cooler than the harvest, move towards the target
If I had a guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I'll never stop like I'm running from the police
Life is a roller coaster so fucked up it falls
My mind shines even when my thoughts seem dark
Gun on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king speak, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they have to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of summer
I'm resting at the head, I need a pillow and a cover
There are no brake pads, there is no such thing as the last, huh
It may not mean anything to you
But I understand that nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm closing shit in the mall
I want this shit forever man
There they go, filling stadiums as Shady spits out his flow
Fuck no! Go bankrupt, this cup runs out, oh no
You haven't had a buzz like this since the last time you overdosed
Back in the game and they know, rap will never be the same as before
Hitting the brains of these hoes and setting the name as it goes
The passion in the flame ignites, you can't extinguish it once we ignite it
This shit is exactly what the shit I'm talking about when we mutinied
You're dealing with a few real villains that stand inside a booth, the truth is spilling
And spit out true feelings until our tooth fillings fly out of our mouths
Now rewind it
With the bass so strong that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so in case you're thinking of saving face
So Drake
It may not mean anything to you
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
I'm closing shit in the mall
I want this shit forever man
Is it the strength of your feelings?
Overthrowing your pain?
You will see new heights that you will reach
And as you pass, your sweet destiny undulates
And more melody for your head
Look how you speak on my behalf, you know?
Yes i couldn't pay a bill
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was staying in your house
Trying to uncover the whole thing
I saw people doing things
I almost gave up on the music thing
More life, more everything
I should never have touched your phone
You really must love life on the road
Everything that never comes home, shit
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Dom Rosé Toast
Hidden hills where I post
I start my day slow
Look at my face though
Drunk J-Lo text
Boi-1da recovered the rebound
I used to get paid for shows in entry money
Five, ten, twenty, disinfect your hands after counting that
Me and Gibbo talk about it
Eating Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Writing our name on a double cup
We don't even have a tour bus
The girls wouldn't even think about recording me
I fall asleep in brotherhoods
He had a few different priorities.
Weezy had all the authority
The women I like ignored me
I know the rhetorical question
I took the plane from the Oracle team
Mom never cooked much
Used for chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G
I put the game on my knees
I do too much these days to say "poor me"
Where you are I never see you
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Niggas move so waste
Please get out of the house and show yourself
Then I can say it to your face
It's meant to happen, man, it has to happen now
So let's get it out of the way
Many niggas go wrong
I want to move to Dubai
So I never have to kick it with any of you
I didn't hear Hov in that old song
And watch them all die
And I saw many of you die
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Free smoke, free smoke, ayy
Hidden hills where I post, yeah
'You already know, yes
Regarding the problems, yes
House party by the way, yeah
I'm not Kid 'n Play
This kid doesn't play with the flow, yeah
Keep playing with your nose, yeah
You take drugs and do your best, yes
How did you let the boy fight
Do ghostwriting rumors make you ghost?
Oh you niggas have jokes
Free smoke, free smoke
Baka
You know that, huh?
It's an East Side thing, huh?
You know that, huh?
More life
Tat my name on you girl so I know it's real
Tat my damn name on you so I know it's real
Tell a bad bitch "Girl, let's hang up"
You know me, Rolex, gold chain
Fuck my young niggas, XO Gang
You get so drunk that you forget your name
Burning incense, smoking my own shit
I have black wood in my white range
I go when that light changes
I'm drizzy drake for my old bitches
Voodoo boy to my new hoes
I miss this and I want it back, so I agree with these new flows
New flows, new flows, rap is stress but it pays very well
The pimp flows and the screw flows, my shit sounds like gray ribbons
Now let me go to that cup once before a nigga hit that road
These days keep going too fast, so give me anything to make the shit go slow
Yeah money in my safe but i'm living dangerous
They told me the shit would change, but I really don't see any change in us, oh no
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my damn name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I don't try to hear it
Because when I'm not around, I'm still there in spirit
Tat my damn name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah I'll still be yours
What happens?
I play with her mind, she masturbates in my Porsche
It's simple love, simple math
Her chest okay, not a wrinkle in her ass
Pouffe hash purple, welcome to my circle of power
No suckers, no sneaks and we know when cowards work
Rolls Royce Rolling, Rose Gold Rollies
My mom still prays for her rubber man
I love a bitch who knows how to keep me rolling
Tat my damn name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I don't try to hear it
You'll still be mine, yeah you'll still be mine
Tat my damn name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
You'll still be mine, yeah I'll still be yours
Tat my damn name on you let them know you love the boy
What happens?
I don't have to work in the morning, so I always stay for one more
Fuck what they say, I tell you there are no side effects, I'm sure
I went from driving in old shit to drivers opening doors
Yes, ask for it, it's yours, if you ask for it, it's done
You will meet everyone I know, at first it may seem like a lot
But everyone plays their part, put it on everything I have
And all I care about is my city, man, I can't say it enough
I heard things about you that you can't say about us
I just hold it down for my side, I just hold it down for my set
I only give everyone a part of this and make do with what's left
Yeah I told you it's our world, you fool thinking I'm wrong, ooh
Stop asking how the fucking needle feels
Tat my damn name on you let these niggas know it's real
What happens?
Tat my name on you so I know it's real
Tat my damn name on you so I know it's real
I know it hurts, but I don't try to hear it
Because when I'm not around, I'm still there in spirit
Tat my damn name on you when I go, you'll still be mine, yeah
Tat my damn name on you let them know you love the boy
What happens?
D-D-D-Do that
I have friends with money, and I also have money
So we put it together and let you choose what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm making money)
Because we can do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm making money)
I have friends with money, and I also have money
So we put it together and let you choose what to do
And then we do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm making money)
Because we can do that!
(Little nigga, you know I'm making money)
Uhh, focus on the women, so you do less
It is light work, the flow is heavy like a wet sponge
I'm getting rich because I think being bankrupt is less fun
Celebrating father's day every day, so don't make yourself sound
Choose anywhere in the world, the dough is constantly coming
I'm chilling out with T, Jay and Nico
My city is not a city that supports its own people
But I run it, you say something about it, I doubt it
I have this Gucci wallet, I don't leave home without it
"Bring a bottle to this cabin, no, we don't need a fucking mouth!"
Excuse me, that was rude
If you just started dancing I say I'm about to finish
What else is there to do?
She calls me and I hit him every time like 'SEND' (damn)
So we put it together and let you choose what to do
And then we do it!
Because we can do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm making money)
I have friends with money, and I also have money
So we put it together and let you choose what to do

(Little nigga, you know I'm making money)
Yes look
Me and 40 assholes, stylizing
Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file on
We can all pitch and that's when it comes to pilin '
And I'm calling your bluff
Don't act like you can't see my marking
Never decorate, believe them because he doesn't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asst
I have never been a believer that existed previously
I wonder what I would be doing when before is this
Dining at Chateau's, directly across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Didn't I treat you better than your old man?
I tend to drop
I'm thrown and I'm high
I think i am vomited
Tone it all up
My black grows
And tell me when you start paying to show up, damn
I have friends with money, and I also have money
So we put it together and let you choose what to do
And then we do it!
(Young paid nigga, you know I'm making money)

(Little nigga, you know I'm making money)
What happens? It's been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught
With those bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
I would never make you feel like this, because ...
I love myself, I love myself enough for both of us
So you trust me
I know you've been through more than most of us.
Then what are you? What are you afraid of?
Darling you give but you can't take love
Yeah i needed to hear that shit i hate when you're submissive
Aggressive passive when we are texting, I feel the distance
I like when money makes a difference but it doesn't make you different
And influence a generation that lacks patience
I've been dealing with my dad, talking about lack of patience
Just me and my old man going back to basics
Well fuck it we had a couple of crowns
We could have rolled up a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talk about you and our pair of moments.
Said we should discuss it like a couple of adults
You're a flower girl, beautiful girl, I'm in your zone
It looks like you came from the 70s on your own
My mother is 66 years old and her favorite line to hit me is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and be alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I look for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities were you looking for before?
Who are you accommodating for? Who better for you than the boy?
I love myself, I love myself enough for both of us
So you trust me
I know you've been through more than most of us.
Then what are you? What are you afraid of?
Thinking of Texas, when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had Houston's leverage
When I got Summer to Michael Kors with my mom's debit
A weak attempt to flex, I'll never forget it
Because that night I played his three songs
Then we got to talk about something we didn't agree on
So she starts to tell me that I'll never be as great as Trey Songz
Boy I was wrong, that was just negative energy to feed me
Now it is therapeutic to spend money in the Gallery
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Milestones of the muses that inspired the music.
When I could see that he was sincere without trying to prove it
The one I needed was Courtney of Hooters at Peachtree
I've always felt that she was the piece to complete me
Now that you are engaged to get married, what is the rush of the engagement?
Remember our talk in the Ritz parking lot
Learn the true consequences of my selfish decisions.
When you find out how I live I just hope to be forgiven
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities were you looking for before?
I love myself, I love myself enough for both of us
So you trust me
Then what are you? What are you afraid of?
Darling you give but you can't take love
"Sido Baka aka Not pleasant from time, G
Scarborough ting from time, G
I've been having di dem dem since time, G
So I don't know what about these
Little waste out here, huh?
Everyone needs to know themselves. "
What happens?
It's been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught
With those bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with it
I would never make you feel like this, because ...
I love me
I love myself enough for both of us
So you trust me
I know you've been through more than most of us.
Then what are you?
What are you afraid of?
Aggressive passive when we are texting, I feel the distance
I like when money makes a difference but it doesn't make you different
I started to realize a couple of places where I could take it
I want to go back to when I was that boy in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, the pussy, the holidays
I've been dealing with my dad, talking about lack of patience
Just me and my old man going back to basics
We've been talking about the future and the time we wasted
When you put down that bottle, girl, that nigga is amazing
Well fuck it we had a couple of crowns
We even talk about you and our pair of moments.
Said we should discuss it like a couple of adults
You're a flower girl, beautiful girl, I'm in your zone
It looks like you came from the 70s on your own
My mother is 66 years old and her favorite line to hit me is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and be alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
But girl, what qualities were you looking for before?
I love me
I love myself enough for both of us
So you trust me
I know you've been through more than most of us.
Then what are you?
What are you afraid of?
Darling you
I love me
I love myself enough for both of us
I know you've been through more than most of us.
Then what are you?
What are you afraid of?
Darling you
You give but you can't take love
Shoulda spent more nights
We would have been fine
All of these should, coulda, wouldas
In your ear once
Prolly wasting my time
Because she heard it all
Because she heard it all
But you heard it all
Well i will say it anyway
Shawty, I'm from town
You don't have to be in love to fuck
Girl I'm just trying to say
I'm from the city, oh
But it never made us different, oh
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic.
Somewhere between I want it and I have it
Somewhere in between I'm sober and I'm up
But I stay down, girl, I always stay down, I get down, I never lie down
I promise to break everyone before I break
Everybody just wait now, so much on my plate now
The people I believed in didn't even show that they were facing now
What do they have to say now? They can't say anything now
Nothing has really changed but they still look at me in one way now
You may feel that nothing is the same
I've still been drinking on the low, mobbin on the low
Fucking in the low, smoking in the low
I've still been plotting low, plotting low
I've only been drinking low, mobbin low
I've been plotting low, plotting low
As far from perfect as everyone I know
You know that role my passion
I made every woman feel mine and no one else
And now you hate me, stop pretending, stop facing that, I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I saw you naked
Girl you know I remember, don't be a suitor
Getting high in the condo, that's when it all comes together
But you've been missing girl and you could feel that nothing was the same
I've still been drinking on the low, mobbin on the low
Fucking in the low, smoking in the low
I've still been plotting low, plotting low
As far from perfect as everyone I know
I've only been drinking low, mobbin low
Fucking in the low, smoking in the low
I've been plotting low, plotting low
As far from perfect as everyone I know
Drinking, smoking, fucking, plotting
Schemin ', plottin', schemin ', gettin' money
Drinking, fucking, smoking, plotting
Uh, this is life for me
My mom told me this was right for me.
This is the shit I want to go out on
Play this shit at my funeral if I get caught slipping
Naked women swimming, this is how I'm living
Donate a million to some kids, that's how I feel
A black man filling the sands, who the hell could see us?
I had to bring Rose down to the knee before getting up again
Yours truly, boy
I just build and build more, you niggas build to destroy
You all niggas party too much, man, just relax and record
No filler, you feel it now if you don't feel it before
Yeah yeah this is the shit I wanna go out on
Digital camera, freeze the moments
Using money and talent as my main component
Normally Drake drinks Don P but
You're the kind of girl I need Patron
We could do it, corporate sponsor
Your man neatly rode his son's Elantra
You could drop it, it's forgotten, you have options
And also I show these boys how to bring the money
When they rhyme it's not hot, and the records don't sell
Stuntin 'on the strip, it came without ID
And I only brought cash, if they register well
I'm fine Drake makes a phone call and I'm inside
Welcome to the life of an icon
And I don't like jewelry, but I'm thinking of you
So
To back it up, go put some weight on it
Because it's okay, do what you want
Make me believe you
(Make it shawty) make it shawty, make it shawty
Get-get-get-get-get
Make it shawty, make it shawty
Lloyd I see you Danny
Atlanta I see you, and if it's ten o'clock
Toronto, do it for all of you
yes man
Hello
I have been hurt many times
It got to a point
I can not do this anymore
I need someone to love me
You need me to fix that shit
You need me to fix that shit
So we can get together
You need me
You need me
Just romantic
Do all the little things, little things, little things
That excites me
Like your woman
Give me a good night kiss
On the phone
When you work late
Tell me how much do you need this
Because we deserve it
We can be together, but
So we can get together
You need me to fix that shit
You need me to (yeah, yeah)
You need me to (yeah)
Dun I know, because
N.E.R.D flow, spaz if I am previously invoked
I'm about to change the fucking game, pass the remote
I am part of the choir, it is the motto that my brother sang
Money-over-bitches dot com verify domain
Wow, I mean a red moon ... I did it again for them
Let me leave a space for your blood affiliation
I mean, heavy metaphors flow so over weight
I can rap around these other youngsters like a cobra snake
Frozen frost nigga drizzy, no body as cold as Drake
Keep your butt in line, don't try to skate
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get into deep shit
I'm twenty-one years old tell me who I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real because I'm loving the hood, I'm not even talking about street shit
Young angel, young liar and I'm done trying
It's in me, everything is in me
This is for all the strippers because I know they will hit him tellem, they will back him up and they will throw him, they will back him up, they will back him up and they will throw him down
There are no guns here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed your family my fiscal year
Tax groups and round-trip faxes
My money comes in a full circle, get up on my axis
Nebby I will kill them, just because I promised
They think I'm being arrogant but I'm just being honest
I'm swallowing the goose, I have a loose model, and I never go out partying unless I have some bottles and a booth
I'm just walking to the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just patient because I want it to make sense
White mug, orange pop, Tennessee state crap, let go and appreciate greatness ... Drizzy!
Wayne: Yes, p-p-pass the dro. I'm a beast and you ask hoes. And they could even say that you should leave me alone
Scared homie. Because they just like me
Like Shaggy I touched that boom bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a shit
I'm not talking about moths, but you can rip my balls off
And yes, I'm falling, but I fall and if a bitch in heat can fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin to private planes
I never sat on any bench, I got into games
Carter ball harder starter, ten girls penthouse outfit you will order
Whatever you want ... wine and cheese crackers
They take off their clothes and put on my t
My gun and my money don't divide, call that Siamese shit
My watch makes the damn time freeze
Yah, girl, bless me, suck my dick when I sneeze
Cheap apartment, just the kitchen I need
And eighteen G's is why the chicken crosses the street
Whatchya knows, my niggas, so
Weezy I ignore liars, baby, I light the fire, I'm like a Michael Myers, I leave your body in the dryer
I got the shot by my side, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy obviously one blows up in your ivy league
I have no rivalry, if so, you will have a victim, oops, I meant a victim, oops, I meant catastrophe, oops, actually
You niggas are just an ass to me, and the big wet pussy is more like what I prefer
Welcome to the meeting, welcome to the funeral, or I hang you on the wall like an art gallery
Dj Drama: Look, I told you it would be worth the wait, right?
Wayne: Dedication threeee
Yeah for dem dogs you know
Man when the shit gets like this, man all over town
You know things will get much worse before they get better
See, mom hit my phone and said rap is not good
Better than her telling me that the check is not good
Now they want to act like it's not good
It's funny because I really did more than I should
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive.
I can't get on the line, so they hang me up to dry
You know 40 want peace, but I can't cut ties
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they will make one.
No matter where I go, I can never walk away
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
I made the decision last night to die for it
(Die, yes, yes, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas ...)
(Die, yes, yes, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas ...)
All these gifts, man, it's getting out of hand
I'm going to start saying to blacks "Do it as you can"
I got it now so I'm a friend to everyone
If I ever lose, I bet we'll never speak again
I made a decision last night, I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive.
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six backwards, now there are nine
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is a great time now
And last night I made the decision to die for it
(Die, yes, yes, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas ...)
(Die, yes, yes, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas ...)
Make me feel the same way I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought about it all
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
I tried to kill myself but they still want the views
I tried to kill myself but they still want the views
I tried to kill myself but I'm very much alive on side six
Yeah i said i'm very much alive on side six
I said that I am ...
Yeahhh
I'm going to start this as you would
Shout out to DJ Wristpect
October!
Drizzy!
Hehe
Here I go!
Uhh
And life is as beautiful as ever when it unfolds
But ask Apple how I get it
I'll be on the phone with a bitch you never know
So you can never dream of me
I'm not bitter, I just get better
If I was in a room and someone was yelling, "Hello bitches!"
I would never turn around because I just don't fit the description
But it's just me
Please don't insult girl, that doesn't suit you
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver is here and you know me ho
I'm the O.V.O cash cow man
I'm not doing functions now, it doesn't mean I don't
And hate begins to grow as we grow
Should I stop talking to the lame
Because they obsess over my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my crazy progression
My engineer is the best in the game.
And since I've been playing with Wayne
People are jealous. I can see that their expressions have changed.
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they have a lot of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the shit, I'm bankrupt
And Drake was at the club and he made a ball like he had no hair
Living life from a completely different angle
Just see the way through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe.
You're gone you have to get over it
And everything you talk niggas get over
And all the people who hate get over it
And yes, I'm turning 22, get over it
You know you gotta listen to my records get over it
I have the city on my back, get over it
Get over it, get over it
DJ Wrispect
Little brother
Big doe see you friend
I'm serious please just get over it
Just for you, I'm going to keep you humble like a murmur in the jungle
You know what I'm talking?
It's drizzy
Just let me live man
Here I go
Look, I know that girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when blacks disappear
And Shawty you are no different
These days it's hard to meet women
I feel like my love life is over
So I am in this position.
I'm afraid to let someone in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit goes
You try to act like it's just me, but I'm not alone
But if you are alone, then
Say my name say my name
When there is no one around you
Say "Baby I love you"
If you are not running games
You're acting a little gloomy, baby
Say my name
If there is no one around you
Yeah uh
Say my name say my name
Because those other men are practical
And this is not the time to act
And this is no time for games
And this is not the time to lock the phone and not go home
And starting some shit when I'm in the zone
Why i've been saying
No new friends, no, no, no
This is not four years ago.
Now forget how it felt when this shit moved slowly
I go into whips that make a kid take the long way home
All my boys surround me saying: "Get money and fuck these hoes"
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every night
I need someone to help me think of someone besides me
Because we don't want to hide anymore
Also, you are no longer shy
No i am not alone
Although nothing was the same
Let me have your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name
Say my name say my name
Say "Baby I love you"
If you are not running games
Say my name say my name
You're acting a little gloomy, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name say my name
If there is no one around you
Look look
And I'm not trying to meet anyone but you
Do me a favor tell me what's going on
I'm drinking XO D is drinking something from Appleton
Usually the things I want I always learn
Cheating was great, I will never record the track again
Although my ex is one of my rapper friends
I don't want to seem like I'm always verbally attacking them
You can stop, I know you've heard of me
Babygirl ya ya ya you've heard of me
Pay attention I guarantee it will be
One of the best decisions you've ever made
I'm ringing them all I live in the shade
Previously naughty behavior was the leader of me
You could say he was cool to some degree cocky
But now I need a culprit
I'm talking about shopping all day shopping at the mall with
Friends I play with
I will kill this song until I really die
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best until the stats come
Where you can't wear hats inside, it's just pants and ties
But you never act surprised
Just hold it down for your boy until the plates arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand in the smoothie
I give it to you, and you take it best
When I give you what I give you
(You'll like it like this)
When I give you what I give you
(You throw it back)
She's not a woman in the world who can doubt that (oh)
I need a woman, not a girl because I am for that (oh no no)
(You'll like it like this)
(You throw it back)
She's not a woman in the world who can doubt that (oh)
I need a woman, not a girl because I am for that (oh no no)
And when I give you what I give you
Yeah it's me again Songz with a 'z' again
Play, I'll visit you
Puts you in critical condition
So don't twist it nigga
But let's go back to the pimp's nigga
Intercontinental can you catch me lying down
Something with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
Why i love what i do
I recorded a couple of videos now we have the frozen city
Something like my doll be
Niggas know how this shit is
Enter the security club I am never registered
Buy so much liquor that they give us a couple of free sips
I'm in Henessy
Straight without cubes
Take me where the women are
Drake brings Patron to his face until he wastes it
I'm flying until I get out of space in Matrix
I'm digressing
But at the same time I'm spitting a rhyme of flames
Baby what's your name they call me the mind of the game
We could take a couple of photos to break it down
Take it to the hole, put me on top
Let me fill the sand
I will be Gilbert Arenas
When I give you what I give you
(You'll like it like this)
When I give you what I give you
(You throw it back)
She's not a woman in the world who can doubt that (oh)
I need a woman, not a girl because I am for that (oh no no)
And when I give you what I give you
When I give you what I give you
(You throw it back)
She's not a woman in the world who can doubt that (oh)
And when I give you what I give you
Take care of me, I'm bound to shine
You better take care of me, I'm bound to shine
'Members doing shows', nobody appears
They used to laugh when my whip was on the crane
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke
Take care of me, I'm about to shine
Time to roll the dice, time to change the li-i-ight
No more than 9 to 5, dri-i-ive autopilot
We used to work fries, now we're supersi-i-ize
We put on a suit and tie, we'll touch the sky
We get so certified, we get certified
Fuck you still hating, that's an F-Y-I-I-I
They're going to hit this here all summer
Take care of me, I'm about to shine
Yes Yes
Come up, my voice is very low
(Careful, careful
Why, black? (Out with the police) Cops
(Everything is love when I travel from top to bottom) From top to bottom
I started very low
It started from the bottom, now we are here now
Take care of me, I'm about to shine
We are about to get all nine
We are the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time
Take care of me, I'm about to shine
I only take the dreams that have sold me
And sell them for more, you know
Cause I'm driving around this bih no sunroof
Man, the glow made me feel like I was weapon-proof
Trying to avoid more confrontation
I just have to try harder
Taking the time to clear my mind
Because as soon as I can let it go
Take care of me, I'm bound to shine
Through devotion
Blessed are the children
We love you all too!
We believe that if there is something they want to do in life
Can i listen immediately
Blessed are the children
We live for it
Come on, all of you
I said it's okay
Clap tonight
Come on, all of you
And they want and want and want and want
Want me yeah
I've been calming down, don't start with me
Trying to keep him at peace is a struggle for me
Don't stop at 6 a.m. to snuggle with me
You know I like it when you love me
I don't want to die to be missed
Yes, I see the things that want me
I hope I have some brothers who will survive me
God's plan, God's plan
I feel good, sometimes not, ayy, no
I was down Weston Road, ayy, nessed
Could I get a G.O.D. down, yeah wait
I'm going hard on Southside G, yeah wait
I make sure the north side eats
What they want and want and want and want
They love me
There are many bad things
What they want and want and want and want
Yes, ayy, ayy
She says "Do you love me?" I say, "only in part
I just love my bed and my mom, sorry "
And you know me
Turn O2 into O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
'Imagine if I never knew the broskies
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this alone, ayy, no, ayy
Someone looking at this shit close, yes, close
It's been me from Scarlett Road, ayy, road, ayy
I could fall like G.O.D., yeah wait
I'm going hard on Southside G, ayy wait
I make sure the north side eats, yeah
And still, bad things
There are many bad things
What they want and want and want and want
They want me yeah yeah
Bad things
There are many bad things
What they want and want and want and want
Want me yeah
They want, want, want in me
(Yes)
Ooh i wish you
This is our fall
Yeah i swear they want me
(Bust down, bust down)
I will keep it on the street
I don't want meat
You see walk with the piece
God's paradise, God's paradise
God is fine
God I'm fine
Ready for fall
I swear that bitch wants me
Bad things
There are many bad things
They wish
They wish
(Wishing me)
Wishing me
She said, "Do you love me?"
I say "only in part"
50 dubbings, they even tattooed me
81 will bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn 02 to Dog 03
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never left the broskies
God's plan, God's plan
(Yah-ah)
Yes they want
Oh yeah!
And pay the fee for my last 4 shows
I make a song and use four streams
She used to be a Christian before
But now all he wants to do is buy Christian Dior clothes
As a baby, those are cute, I adore those
Me and the seller build such a relationship
He understands the fact that I'm spending mass on the high seas
Cash only, homie transactions
And please don't get the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they don't know I bought it
I've been doing this for years buddy, thoroughly thought that
But too late now, it's too legitimate to hit them with
Lawsuits even if those are acts I committed
I have a Jewish lawyer as my main advocate
A true Menschkeit as they say he is a legal bender
And ATF is present in every real member
The coalition is very efficient.
You have to be invited or there is no admission
We know the tradition
We spend money, so don't try to compete if you're not in position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this test
Where am I about to go home as New Edition
Use it to record in the basement that Rennie grew his piff on
If Hov is Jordan, I think I'm fine with Pippen until I mention that I want to play a new position
No team playing, no screen configured
Because I want to win games, coach, I'm sick of helping
Take it, the break is over, nigga
And I will keep killing them until the day Drake ends
The wait is over, the tape is coming
They are shitting but I am equipped with a good pipe
The human mind is so eager to hate something
And try to play it like it's not jumping
And it's the situation you found Drake in
The condo I just bought is empty
Thinking about what I could have done to make my first innovative video
And every time I'm flowing into the microphone
I treat this session as if it were the last.
And I pretend that tomorrow is the day that I will go through life
I guess this is goodbye, good night and good luck
Packed bags, soft black pack that brightens them
I'm looking at these niggas as I invite them
Who told you to mention me?
I'm high my friend you're elemental
Telling you that you sell drugs and never sold a Century Sam
Say they deny you the entrance exam
You get fluent and you're done for ', talk in a verse
Over you fraud niggas who never shoot and run first
On the cell phone, and I got a ten on the other end like an eight bi
Six two and they tell me you're tall
So I just pass by and stay cool until hate dies
I do nothing that can offend these cats
But I wish I had a place where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and write these punches
As long as you never find your way home, I'm fine with it
I never blow a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least I'm not Mr. Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm recording records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you're flying Jeezy
This song will let you know that I'm not the one to choose
White with yellow, the easier I am a Swiss
I only have a couple of girls that I'm willing to kiss
With the rest, I wear the charm they can't resist
If they want to smoke, they get a purple touch.
However, two things that you are are jealous and irrelevant.
And I'm an officer, what is officially true?
Calling names would only be beneficial to you
I'm just tiring you out, niggas, and michelin's crew
I know an answer is something you are eager to do
And you? you are smaller to me than a tack
Music enjoys it, well I'm just trying to bring back the fun
But you're making out all these silly clues, already, Sixteens LL
Because I listen to them and I don't call him come back
It's more like shame or disgrace
Considering that I am the one you want to move
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your clumsy singles, the weakest mixtapes
And this is what makes you say you came looking for Drake
And I'm thinking that the hood is right for you
The sun shines on my career, it's good night for you, huh
I'm thinking the hood is right for you
The sun shines on my career, it's good night for you, nigga
Oh yes oh yes oh
Summer is mine
I swear I said it a hundred times, I need it back
I wish you would come looking for me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed, girl, I needed that from you
I'm spending time just taking care of myself right now
I'm making money just taking care of myself, girl
But the good guys go
But the good guys go
The good guys go, if you wait too long
You should go before you stay too long
But don't you get married, don't you compromise
I know you're getting older, you don't have time to waste
I can't lose you, I can't help it, I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I've been chilling out in the city where the money's high and the girls are going down
In case you started wondering why my new shit sounds so H-Town
But when everything's ready, baby, I'm yours if you're still around
She knows, she knows, she knows
Ooh, ooh-oh, ooh
But the good guys go
The good guys go, if you wait too long
The good guys go, if you wait too long
Then you should go
You should go before you stay too long
Make me hate where I'm from, you're as fake as they come
Everyone has weapons, who the hell is going to squeeze?
Everyone has SARS, you're not fucking around with these
Why do you want to be a ghetto? Tell me what it is about
Why are you trying to get in where I'm trying to get out?
Why won't you be yourself? Why don't you tell us the truth?
Like how you only carry weapons when you're in the cabin
You're just a fantasy, a family as weak as it gets
And you're not talking bitch, cuz I don't hear girls
I don't argue with the girls, because I really am a pimp
But I will tell you this, as far as you are concerned
Take my Santa Claus out and make the holidays burn
You can call me Grinch, because you are just Who is
Just another bunch of false acts with nothing to prove
Now let the kids play like the rider ride
We spend all day, these niggas idolize
They claim they want nigga fame, so we decided
That we will make them some stars until the drama dies
But they can go back to the holes where mommy lies
Funny, claim the bully life they abide by
But he runs over them, then they become the silent type, they want to commit
And roll with the bitches that have the right body
These niggas ain't built, ain't got the body type
Time to break the spirit of a black like Friendship, try to fool the audience
Feel the atmosphere
Stars in your presence, kings of the city are horrified by the peasants
I don't have to say names, we can all get a reference
Your children's brains and information in the West End
Teachers stumbling in bars
Nigga remains angry because his arrogance is on Mars
You all niggas don't think we're calling you all
Claim that you want war, okay, on guard
Ayo, hello rapper sir
When you're in the cabin tell me why you have to lie
Come on, spit out the truth, all I hear is bang bang, push this, push that
But if you rush, where's the money?
There's no proof, Dr. Seuss, the story tells when it rhymes, like
Once upon a time I was really in the rut
There's another lie, I couldn't beat myself
I'm just going to the generic rap rap that
Rap over Ki but couldn't show me 10 G's
And these nigga 'drying dry on their shirts
Standing out, like a sore thumb at D
My nigga please, if you really had a job
You would do what you do and you wouldn't put it on your shirt
You're not hustla, just a nigga who can rap well
See there's a height requirement, nigga to mention my (smart) name
How the fuck little niggas didn't stay in your lane
Man, you offered me a truce and I took it
Now I hear this shit, how the hell am I going to overlook it?
How the fuck are you a hustla with your factory work?
And I don't get it, nigga, I'm a fucking diabetic
And I don't usually eat all of you sweet niggas
Waddup Roxx? are we ok now then you dive
I'm saying we don't believe you all niggas (nah)
G-35, x5 nah niggas (yeah)
This is a public announcement for my niggas (yeah)
No more good night, good morning, goodbye niggas
I don't appreciate that niggas say my name in shit
It's like putting a knife against the full lyric clip
If I was rapping like you would have killed me
And no, this is not meat, some ingredients are missing
Dog, you're not a general, stay obedient
Piggyback, that's not something I had to do
Laughing at Drake? You should have seen how I was laughing at you
I don't bother about a little shit, angry? A little
I don't do the little subliminals, I'm tackling it
And if Littles wants to get in the way, then I suggest it.
They called you bitch, they tried to act
They challenge them to a fight and then withdraw
So tell me how the hell can I respect you cats
If you're a gangsta, what part of the game is that?
How does it feel to count dough while clapping the heat?
I heard that weak shit and I just wanted the beat (it's true)
And fuck the women who lie to all the boys they met
And fuck the characteristics of my songs and the offers on the table
Or basically it's fucking everything you strive to achieve
And it's the resolution room, I'm finishing it here
If I copy the Budden stream, you imitate his career
And the same money we hear giving to charity
You must be hitting Littles to give it some clarity (what about Littles?)
Because that's your boy at home, I think he owes him so much
Tell him that pressing 25 doesn't mean you've sold that much
And Breana, I don't want to alarm you
But you need to get out of the car to record this video in Parma (Tony!)
And this is not hating my nigga, we call it karma
But I Thug Life, show me where the hammer is
Yes i took an l on my own and they didn't hurt me
You try to cover your lies like a canopy
And I try to knock down 17-year-olds in Bramalea (I know)
And we don't take it off
We only say that no one answers you
No, no one is thoroughly willing to give a cosign (no one)
And you don't even sell blow, you just waste time
You can't even get a factor grant
So stop rapping, go repair parts at a tractor plant (damn)
And listen here, Tetley Tea
We all have niggas making deals "Mr. Wishheart" (what's up Cam)
It's not great to use another nigger as a threat though
I told you bitch, I heard an echo from seven men
You say I'm rushing, my source of coke
They say you never moved it and that it actually broke
And you risk crack and hang out with black crime
Just so you can have something to say on your rap lines
Dog if I were you, I tell you what I would do
I'd cut ties to the police and just get you fired
Lose the body bundle and velcro that the wire passes through
Because they are the only people filming who want to hire you (it's true)
With what happened in a weekend I could get you
Some of them think you got money, you little liar
But I don't admire you, short niggas tell stories
Goodbye Aristo, I just checked you out!
These are my One St. Thomas streams
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
They seem virgins, but they trust they will go
Discuss life and all of our common goals.
Smart kids who smoke weed, honor roll
See how the champagne diamonds sparkle
Whatever you have is clearly attractive
These other rappers have that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
If you don't have it, you don't have it, the theory is brilliant
People ask how the music is going, I heard it pays
Damn, "I guess so" is the message
Sometimes I feel like I'm spending my money just because
Until I can shake the hand of the man who is blessing us
Yeah I know these niggas lose the bad letter
Kush made the room smell like a teenage spirit
Until I lose, for now I am the sole leader of the game
I fly in private so no one tells me to raise my seat
And book a suite where your favorite singer and I meet
Who do you like tell me who it is
I will make sure that woman is next on my list
I should call him one night, but shit I can't resist
Without an answer from me, you really don't exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling is shit
I swear, nigga cunt, get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your butt to drop
Why is your scary ass looking down?
Didn't anyone tell you that your costume was the most ridiculous outfit?
With the plugs on my nose now, I can smell the settings
I try to tell them not to judge me because they heard things
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
When we used to smoke well in the Oakwoods
And let the girls fall like coins on the couch
Now we just fuck all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one just chosen
Because this is really shit that I don't expect you all to have
I'm nervous but I'm going to kill him because they're about to let the real team in
Throwing up in the black group, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In turtle-rimmed glasses, waiting for someone to catch him
People say old Drake, we start to miss him
But they need to be a little bit more specific
Dodging your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money receives all my love and affection
All black cars like the cover of Essence
I'm allergic to coming in second but never sneeze
Y.M.O.E. black yes
Uh yeah this is what everyone wants
Very typical of October
Young Money
ATF
Thanks later on this bitch wasssup
Weezy free in this bitch wasup
June 15 on this bitch wasup
Noel that's it ahhhhhh
You've been home for three full days.
Acting like you have chores to do
Boy this house is too clean
I don't think there's anything else to do
Oh you don't need that girl she did it all wrong
It was still you before she appeared
I mean, I understand the pain
Someone did the same to me
I just put that nigger in its place and then I got over it
Then I got over it and if you want to know the truth
I think you should get dressed and go out tonight
Go out tonight
Order a drink, don't even think too much
Call a couple of friends you know you can have fun with
And come out tonight, come out tonight
Because you could meet me
And I'm searching, and I'm searching
And I'm looking for someone to be with
And I'm looking for what you're looking for
Yes you could meet me
And I'm searching, and I'm searching
And I'm looking for what you're looking for
Yes you could meet me
Yes Yes
Tell me how you really feel
I'd ask you what's the deal
But you guys don't even have a deal
Most blacks with a deal
You many things
Do not know anyone
That could tell me what to do.
I heard that the hood claimed you
That can't sit well
Still mine, all mine
Cosign, cosign
I stop on such big yachts
Hype Williams, Big Pimpin ', yeah
Like old times
The same niggas from the old days
Lotta sides on the same side
OVO, we are a gold mine
But I'm turning gold, there's no time
Doing plat, plat alone
Guys better back off of me
Hall of fame, hall of fame
As if I took off my shirt, as if I took off my shirt
The whole city is going crazy
The first five, without debating
The first five, the first five, the first five
And the whole city rates me
And I'm back inside The Matrix
And I said we would make it
We really put some days in
Hey, why are you so excited? You know what I'm saying?
What happened?
Did you win the Grammy? Dammit
You act like you fucking win a trophy and shit
This nigga turns around
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
Swervin 'off the pan
I'm hanging out, they can't take me
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
I'm showing, they can't bear me
I'm showing, they can't bear me
I'm walking away, they can't take me
I'm out, you can't stand me
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
I will take off like a bandit
I'm not dating a Xanax
Get angry, start airing it
Come on, it's not friendly
I stand out, I don't mix
When I say I wanted to say that
I don't want nan features them
I don't want features or anything
You can't even enter my guest list
They want me to go to the Met Gala
I want a Percocet and a gallon.
That Actavis Hi-Tech doesn't matter
We sit right on the court
I know the players from both sides.
I'm pulling money, fuck a cosign
Keep a fo'-five for the po boys
Black tints, low profile
Celebrating every day
Cause I'm really cool outside the coca house
Counting every day
'About to bring a full' another whip
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
I'm showing, they can't bear me
I'm out, you can't stand me
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
They think I won a Grammy
Uh, I'm a distraction
Coming from my place and I don't signal when I return
If cash is beautiful then money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfucker from Maxim
Open to my page and admire my wish
Frequent flyer, I aspire to retire
My voice is alone, even if I'm with the choir
I have a cannon on my hip, but nigga, this is not Mariah
Na, this is the record rental killer
I sleep and as with the gun, the beat is all I need
Look, I believed, despite the blacks they hated
Each bar has the first forty eighty
The me and the bitch the same, we feel so related
I put a thousand, I could probably fuck the waitress
So wait, just take this
One lies at a time, make sure it makes sense
White Mug, Orange Pop, Tennessee State Crap
Drop a four and then appreciate The Greatness, nigga
I wrote this verse sitting in my new car
Sometimes where you are going is too far
It's more about where you are
Someone, somewhere really understood me
Yes, I dream big, without false hopes
But understanding rich is how we're all ending
I'm on the elevator label, send them in!
Hermès binding, ice blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I don't know what's permanent
They want me to go, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I just get bigger
That's the word for my nigga
Yeah october firm in court
She wants to get married tonight
My broski and I are twins, but we are not alike
I don't nap
Me and the money are too attached to go and do that
Muscle relaxation
That and the joint put me on my back, I have to unpack
Virginia Black
I could go make enough money with that and not even rap
What is that? Acts?
Maximum contract, I have to bring that shit back
Hermès binding, ice blue mink
Tat on my ribs like I don't know what's permanent
Bury me now and I just get bigger
That's a word for me, a word for me ...
Who's not a gang, bitch? Let me find out
City feds hate to see us on a high note
I change the flow like time zone change
I have to do Maybach, she wants to fuck on the way home
Yes i met her once and i made it
I know I said the top five, but I'm the first
Hermès binding, ice blue mink
Bury me now and I just get bigger
That's the word for my nigga
She says "Kiss me like you miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
Just fuck her like it's not me "
Damn those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I'm just telling him to forgive me
Two years ago I was in love and I gave the luggage to my ex
Everything is for her to carry, bags she deserves to carry
I hate that, I make it so hard just to talk, right?
I'm off topic, right? I get it, don't I?
You'll be rocking one of the rings that you pointed to
While you shop with a nigga don't lie
She's losing it right now
Because if I wasn't who I am, she would have already moved
But this money coming in is just confusing shit right now
You just told me I'm not shit, I guess I'm doing it right now
I say I prefer to be with you, but you are not around
So I'll call someone and see if they're down
Because I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask him for anything
But I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she's here and we're both gone
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she doesn't want a weekend, she wants everything from me or nothing from me
If she can't work with me, she says she's done with me
You know how it goes: don't go crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with your shit, I put you back in your place
Like I don't know about the niggas you fuck with too?
And whoever you are with, they have nothing with you
That is something to do when there is nothing to do
Yes, but you are losing it right now.
She has choices that she should make
I think you're choosing it now
I say I prefer to be with you, but you are not around
So I'll call someone and see if they're down
Because I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
Half the time we don't end up fucking, I don't ask him for anything
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her in months
But I hate sleeping alone, I hate sleeping alone
So she's here and we're both gone
Oh oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh
Confidence overdose
Drinking every night because we drink for my achievements
And they say I'm back, I agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in it
Someone told me that I fell, ooh, I needed that
I know I exaggerated things, now I have it like this
Put the napkin in my shirt because I'm just mumbling like this
You know well that you don't want a problem like that
You're going to make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy will pay it.
That's something they know
They know, they know, they know (They know, ayy)
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck with other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
They know, they know, they know
Yes!
Tell him I apologize, it happened over time
She says "they miss old Drake" girl don't tempt me
"If they don't understand, they will outdo you
That new shit you got is overdue
You better do what you're supposed to do. "
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Hearing you express all those feelings
Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like All My Children
I guess it really is just me, me and all my millions
You're going to exaggerate me and make me catch a body like that
‘Because I live for this, it's not just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and they play it
I don't even have to say it, they know
They know, they know, they know (They know)
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck with other guys
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know
I'm yelling "Money on everything!"
"Money on my mind, mind, mind-mind!"
Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, time, time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yes…
I once heard that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather listen to what was or what will be more than what is
Rather hear how you overcame it for how much it cost you
I'd rather hear about finding yourself than how you got lost
Rather you make this an open letter
About family, and the fight, and it lasts forever
About hearts you've broken and ties you've cut
Without a doubt in my mind, that will make them feel better.
You're your boy, DJ Motherfuckin IllWill
You know I had to team up with my DJ Rampage for this shit here
My man Drake, aka Heartbreak Drake, the new AKA Interscope franchise player
Torronto, stand up
Heartbreak Drake, come on!
All the school children are fed up with books and learning
They don't read anymore, they don't even read anymore
They just wanna be like all the rappers I can't stand
Niggas we don't need anymore
And all the cops are still hanging out at the donut shops
The ice is melting like the world is ending
She asked me
"Who are you going to be when it all ends? When it all ends?"
"Who are you going to be when it all ends? When it all ends?"
I don't want to think about it now
Heat of the moment
I don't even have a strap, if you think we really need one, I'm on it
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
What are we doing?
Ridin 'clean
With you on my mind and I'm thinking dirty things
I have seen some things
I wish we had met as a teenager
Yes sir yes sir yes sir
Because these days I only know conditional love
I'm too used to changing it, oh
And she says, "You don't know how good it is to be you because it's him."
So ask me
Who am I going to be when it's all over? When it all ends?
Who am I going to be when it's all over? When it all ends?
I don't want to think about it now
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment, girl, heat of the moment
The last man fucked up, I'll take it since he doesn't want it
I can't think clearly about the heat of the moment, the heat of the moment
If you're right. You're right. Alright man, well shit, I just wanted ...
They know they are very hot. They don't give a shit. It is the heat of the moment. It is the heat of the moment and that is all. It is the heat of the moment.
I agree
This shit, that's it. It is the heat of the moment. Be 100% female, or try to be 100% male, and wear a damn condom
I have my eyes on you
You are all i see
I want your love and endless burning emotion
I can't beat you
Because you are a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Because you are a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just wait we go home
Just wait we go home
Just wait we go home
I have my eyes on you
I want your love and endless burning emotion
I can't beat you
You left your mark on me
Because you are a good girl and you know it
Because you are a good girl and you know it
I know exactly who you could be
Just wait, we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just wait, we're going home (going home)
You are the girl, you are the only one
I gave you everything I loved
I think there is something, honey
I think there is something, honey
You are the girl, you are the only one
I gave you everything I loved
I think there is something, honey
Because you are a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Because you are a good girl and you know it
Just wait, we're going home (going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just wait, we're going home (going home)
Young money until the young man dies
You hear me cry
You see me riding
We will buy them
Because we are living what these other rappers are lying about
Drizzy Drake, what
Funk Flex, uhh
Hot 9-7, I'm so far
Feeling good, feeling great, how are you?
Drinking pink shit, but no, it's not Nuvo
Slow down before your ass is on Pluto
My city loves me, but I also have enemies of Toronto
Let them sit and talk about
What they would have done if they had been you
But I know that ball without a sphere in sight
And I just know that I'm in the mirror like
You are listening? I hope you listen well
I'm at the Aston making donuts
New York, I can say that people want it
Uhh, what you got for me flex, uh
Vacuum interiors and polished wheels
How is your life This is how mine feels
I like my seat, I like my cold wine
I look good, smell better and rhyme bad
I say I'm on the neck and head of these girls
You and your girl sleep in separate beds
I killed this, tell flex he's dead
You have birthday cake, mines marry high
I get the girl of your dreams and I never call
NY, got it, I'm on whatever
I'm in the girls' condo shown
Yes, why do you take everything personally?
This that direct and offensive flow on purpose
My city, you will never need me
Yes wait, no, they really need me
Holla with me when you finished F’n Weezy
Ho yeah, uh huh
Hahaha, the summer boys are here man
Ayo Trey, I have something wrong for this boy
Most likely you were lying down most days
I made money because of these girls are looking at me
At nineteen it might seem like destined for millions
Promoters on my butt so I guess they completed
I take cues from my big boy Popz
They are getting dirty in the star
But everything looks at me like I'm copying some votes for the bar
I suppose not
To land in the top ten slide in the top five
The same in the first four, trust that I'm a handsome boy
Maybe even the best three Trey you have for me?
Today the maximum interest
Especially when life brings them pain and lately they are stressed
Siblings who earn money must take notes
Someone bring the waiter
If you don't have it, you can catch it later
My money and my love are separated before I promise to date her
I put a division in the middle and learn to separate it
It's not about the tires on my truck
It's not about the ice on my watch
It's not about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
Ridin 'low
I leaned back in the seat when I crawl
This is how i roll
Girl that's how it goes
And I'm trying to find a girl that I can meet who's not fighting
Because it's not about that anymore
It's not about the tires on my truck
It's not about the ice on my watch
It's not about the coupe or my truck
It's not about the tires on my truck
It's not about the ice on my watch
It's not about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
When you ask why I rush on the streets, I'm just who I am
I live for the mass, for the flow, for feeling free
There are not many other types that you can choose to get this luxury
But without everything, I'm still on the game.
Those who hate want to hate, but it's nothing, no
Because women choose to love me (because they love me for what I do)
It's not about the tires on my truck
It's not about the ice on my watch
It's not about the coupe or my truck
Baby it's about the game
It's not about the shoes that I have
It's not about my mass or my rocks
It's not the life that I live, it doesn't stop
You used to used
Yes
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell
that can only mean one thing
I know when that bling hotline
that can only mean one thing
Since I left town, you
I have a reputation for you now
Everyone knows it and I feel left out
Started using less and going out more
Glasses of champagne on the dance floor.
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell
Late night when you need my love
I know when that bling hotline
I know when that bling hotline
that can only mean one thing
Since I left town, you, you, you
You and I just don't get along
Go to places where you don't belong
Since I left town, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Dating some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that bling hotline
that can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
I wonder if you're doing the impossible for someone else
I wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things that I taught you, making myself unpleasant to someone else
You don't need anyone else
Why are you never alone?
Why do you always touch the road?
I used to always stay home
Be a good girl, you were in the area
Yes you should be yourself
Right now you are someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Call me on my cell
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that bling hotline
that can only mean one thing
I know when that bling hotline
Since I left town ...
Hello pretty girl
And I don't blame you at all
You can't resist
Especially when the light is so bright
And the money is so correct
And it comes every night
She doesn't want to leave
She just caught on
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stayed
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And he says: "Hey, now, look how it falls"
Oh oh oh
She never worries
She knows there is more to life.
And she's afraid of ending up alone
Throw yours in the air
Throw yours in the air for her
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stayed
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
And she dances the song
And he says: "Hey, now, look how it falls"
Oh oh
We all have dreams and we are all stars
They all start peak, weekend of stars
Housekeeper calls to see if everyone is decent
Never satisfied with a nice and quiet night
You'll be in games looking good all season
But you're always with me on the night that you go
Ask Lo, ask Lo, I always ask you
Fuck off and we just come to your rescue
Take you inside, bring you some water and undress
I give you everything and the next morning you will forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight, it is very likely to happen again
And she lives in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you meet, it's impossible to lose yourself
Uh, cause I never had you, though I'd be glad
I would probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear, I start to think I'm going crazy
Throw yours in the air for her
Throw yours in the air
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlanta, she just stayed
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas (Ayy)
Houstatlantavegas (Ayy), Houstatlantavegas
And she dances the song
And she dances the song
And he says: "Hey, now, look how it falls"
Oh oh oh
Crazy how you have to wait until dark to see who really is with you
Crazy even when I miss you
The shit will come back and catch you
Crazy like all my niggas, crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all the numbers of my other girls from the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the bar exam
You probably don't remember half the shit a nigga did for you, yeah
Yeah you're not really fucking with me back then
But how about now? (Now)
Oh you thought you had it all figured out back then
But how about now? (Now)
Cause I'm awake right now (I'm awake now)
And you stayed right now, yeah (stuck right now)
What about now? Yes
Girl, how about now, how about now, girl?
What happens now, girl, how about now?
My heart Belongs to you...
Yeah it's always been daddy's little angel
I bought your dad a lot of shit for Christmas
Doesn't even say thank you
I had no money left to act, I was focused on music
I always tried to record CDs of my new shit
You will be like "who is this?" I'm like "me, girl"
You will be like "oh word, right shit?"
The car trips made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah it made me feel like I don't have it like that
I started drinking much more than I used to
People make habits like that, girl
Yes, enough to tell you that I got hurt that year
I'm not even a Christian, I still went to church that year
I guess I just had to pretend that year
I don't even see my friends that year
Places I should have been
Yeah you're not really fucking with me back then
Cause I'm awake right now (I'm awake now)
And you stayed right now (stuck right now)
Oh you thought you had it all figured out back then
Girl, how about now? (Now)
Cause I'm awake right now (I'm awake now)
And you stayed right now, yeah (stuck right now)
You thought the little effort you put in was enough, girl
What about now? Yes
Girl, how about now, how about now, girl?
What happens now, girl, how about now?
My heart Belongs to you
What you need, there's nothing I won't do
What you need, there's nothing I won't do
What you need, there's nothing I won't do
What you need, there's nothing I won't do
I have to do what I have to do, yeah
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to the state of Georgia where tuition is handled
For some random nigga who lives in Atlanta
Who only sees when she feels compelled
He admitted it to me the first time we went out
But she was not an angel, and we never expected
And we never talk too much after I exploded
Just "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I texted him and said I did it
And that's when he texted me and said he was praying it
Then right after texting and saying I'm fainted
She asked what I have learned since I got richer
I learned that Hennessy and the enemies are an incredible mix
Damn, it's fall, it's time for me to revisit the past
There are stories to tell, we've been through it all (Damn)
Interviews are like confessions.
Get out of my dressing room, mistaking me for questions like
Do you love this shit? Are you drugged now
Do you ever get nervous?
You are single? I heard you fucked your girl, is that true?
Are you receiving money?
Do you think the niggas you're with are with you?
And I say hell yes, hell yes, hell yes
Fucking good, fucking good, okay
And we say hell yes, hell yes, hell yes
Fucking good, fucking good, okay
Uhh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Keep some bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like there's no curfew
Bitch if you shake I'll surf you
I flew by plane, she flew commercial
But we still meet later that night
After my session she came
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started to confess
And I started to undress and ask myself to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now he's texting me asking for a shutdown
Damn she says this shit will catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat when we are at the table
She says she hates that she loves me and that she wishes I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break them
I met a female dragon, I had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions.
Leave my room, confusing me with questions like
Do you ever get nervous?
You are single? I heard you fucked your girl, is that true?
Are you receiving money?
Do you think the niggas you're with are with you?
And I say hell yes, hell yes, hell yes
Fucking good, fucking good, okay
And we say hell yes, hell yes, hell yes
Fucking good, very good, good
And we say hell yes, hell yes, hell yes
And we say hell yes, hell yes, hell yes
Man does not live on a hype, huh?
Real ting ay
Yes
I stop at Lexus' like it's '07
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could do a GPS if you need direction
'09 they bet me
But I am Young Money, I have it written on me
Everything I said happened
That light boy like Michael Jackson
But in the verses, he's been blackened
Chasing women a distraction
They want to be on television right next to me
You can't be here by my side
Can't you see Riri by my side?
I especially hate a rapper
They feel the same, but hide it.
They only discuss it in private
Don't get along, we try
What's the point of trying?
I especially hate a fool
They always die for mentioning me
I can't give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
It cost me 50 at Tiffany
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come looking for me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies.
I don't let it affect me
Done
Look what I've done in my life
To make sure the money was correct
They love to talk
I'm just making fun of the hype
I just finished, done, done, done, done
I don't take this shit for granted
I feel like juelz santana
6 cold as Alaska
Roy out of here like NASA
Bustin '1 is out of the plastic
Its too poppin 'gram to fuck her
The chain is too heavy to fit, I mean it
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't talk about me, period
You try to give them your side of the story
They heard it, but they didn't hear it
They feel a way and they won't hide it
Niggas finished being silent
They always die for mentioning me
They have to die eventually
I can't give you empathy
They can't screw with the legacy
After this, no one is a threat to me.
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies.
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was correct
They love to talk
I'm just making fun of the hype
I'm just making fun of the hype
I just finished, done, done, done, done
Man does not live on a hype, huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah I stop at Lexus' like it's '07
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could do a GPS if you need direction
Boss, I'm the great friend
But I'm a year older than my lil homie
'09 they bet me
Everything I said happened
That light boy like Michael Jackson
Chasing women a distraction
You can't be here by my side
Can't you see Riri by my side?
They feel the same, but hide it.
They only discuss it in private
What's the point of trying?
You know the game is sold separately
I swear I just had an epiphany
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come looking for me
My enemies want to be friends with my other enemies.
I don't let it affect me
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was correct
They love to talk
I'm just making fun of the hype
I'm just making fun of the hype
I just finished, done, done, done, done
I stop you on that purple thing
Bumpin 'Purple Rain
Singing "Purple Rain", drinking purple rain
You are not a gang of llamas, you are not the same gang
It's a different world, it's D'wayne Wayne, oh Lord
Ok now we have some action
Fucking Maxim models
I'm too wavy, I'm what's going on
Ok now we have some quick
Smokin 'cookies, drinking Acti
Ok now we have some balance
You see my team is right next to me
You don't see Tina right next to me
I thank you for taking my breath away
But the second I will be the best me
J.R. Smith with the shot
I call my AK Barney and I'm going to let this baby explode
Pull at you like Steph Curry
With my foot on you like effusions
Been outchea from Keith Murray
Codeine caught me with pink urine
I fucked a bitch named Epiphany
My ex wants to be friends with my other ex
And I have no sympathy
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was correct
They love to talk
I'm just making fun of the hype
I'm just making fun of the hype
I just finished, done, done, done, done
Slatt, slatt, slatt
Jeffery (Mario)
Jeffery, ayy
Yes
Feel a rump
Baby, I need something, something
I want to hit him with something, something
You're a rough diamond or something, something
You need to hand it over to someone
You need to give someone luck
You have to stop looking at me
You need to hand it over to someone
Before you finish like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Jeffery)
Look i want you for me
But I know you just left someone else
I know you did, he made you a number (I know, brrrt)
That's why you should move so ... ice cream
Ice cream like there's nobody you'd ever need
Better not give that to anyone but me (yeah)
Patient as it can be, but
I still need some satisfaction
Feel a rump
Baby, I need something, something
You need to hand it over to someone
You need to give someone luck
You need to hand it over to someone
Before you finish like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
I want to see you do more in this life if we take it there (take it)
I want to see you do 911, fuck a Panamera (in a 911)
I see you when I see the real, getting more and more real (real)
Yes Yes Yes
But you have ice like 1017 (ice cream)
I'm here patient as can be, man
I still need some satisfaction
A little less conversation and a little more action.
I need you in Jamaica, chilling out
Feel a rump
Baby, I need something, something
I want to hit him with something, something
You're a rough diamond or something, something
You need to hand it over to someone
You need to hand it over to someone
Before you finish like
Woah, woah, woah, woah, like
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

Nigga, what did you think?
Slatt, slatt, slatt
Jeffery (Mario)
Jeffery, ayy
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah (Jeffery, Jeffery)
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Yes
Yes
Everyone said you disappointed me
Hesitation brings "you" around
It doesn't matter what you used to do
I could never
I could never
Maybe you were reckless yesterday
I am convinced that you know a better way, I know
Some will judge based on what you've been through but
I could never be ashamed of you
I could never
I, I could never (yes, yes)
Hard truth to my face
They told me to go (I only know)
I could never
Things I would choose to do with you if I had the time
A thousand times I screwed you in my mind, trust me, I know
They all said I let you down
And leave the truth, but I can still be found, yeah
I lost my way and only you were there
Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Could you ever?
Could you ever
Sometimes I ask you how you could love me
How could you choose that you would ever love me?
Have a fixed gaze on me
Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Could you ever
Could you ever
Could you ever be ashamed of me?
Why can't you ever?
* Fragment letters *
Ayy
It was destined to happen, the most reliable triple platinum
Link to Mac, link to P if I'm down in Baton (/ and battin '?)
Link to cans link to C, when I'm down in Jackson
These aren't them, it's me, so you know what's going on
Before doing it I said "I have to do it"
And I did it, I did it, I really did it
Flipping cinnamon, grabbing instruments
(Uh)
Please save the cameras
Because we are in the club getting hammered MC
And God forbid we change our wisdom for glamor
And I know that I'm only a child that a woman can make a man
I just want a woman who is 30 when she is 81
Please don't give it all
I hope you can save me a little
The more they pass, the more they tire of what they become
But this one is special
So I make sure my suit fits me well
The one my dad wore in June '85
And to do all the things that he would only do when he got married
So let's do this shit
Tell the reverend that all we lack is his blessing.
Then we exchange votes
Applaud, we bow
And she will be doing tricks for dad
When we take him home
LOL
Yes, ayy (after dark)
In the whip alone
No one has to know (after dark)
I don't have to work anymore (after dark)
You can
Put down the phone, you will need two hands (after dark)
You can't have enough
Girl you know I set it up because after dark
Late night like left eye, I'm crawling
I can't tell if you're dodging calls or missing calls
Because you have been so patient
So I don't know how serious you take it
That narrative for me is not changing
I want to regain your faith in me
I'll be on the way (after dark)
In the whip alone, nobody has to know
(No one has to know) after dark
Knocking on your door, I don't have to work anymore
(I don't have to work anymore) after dark
You can put the phone down, you will need two hands
You can't have enough
Girl you know I set it up because after dark
Late at night, you and I get wet like the pool
So I'm trying to dive in, spend some time, yeah
Get the right environment, have the right mind
It's going to be a long night (Ooh yeah)
Put your feet in this water, you don't want to get your hair wet
We've connected a couple of times, we still haven't taken him there
It did you wrong, it left you wrong
Now you can't trust anyone
You said, "Do anything, but don't lie to me"
I said I ride for you girl, you said you rode for me
Umm, we stopped at the show and then we got a ghost
And when it's night, anything goes
In the whip alone, nobody has to know
(No one has to know) after dark
Knocking on your door, I don't have to work anymore
(I don't have to work anymore) after dark
You can put the phone down, you will need two hands
(Ooh yeah, ooh yeah) after dark
You can't have enough
Girl you know I set it up because after dark
93.7, WBLK, [?] In Quiet Storm, taking you there with Hall & Oates. Moving through the storm in what is now 19 minutes past 10 o'clock. Thank you for your phone calls as we get closer to your requests and dedications. The phone lines are open for me to send a love, its dedications of love notes. 644-9393, call me. Coming soon, we will go through your storm with Troop, Fantasia, Chaka Khan, my Funny Valentine Jill Scott, offering you whatever and more, Mr. Luther Vandross's selected music, as we begin his first hour of the most selective, The Four Most Seductive Four Hours and relaxing on 93-7. It's Al Wood and you're safe, soft and warm, in the loving embrace of my storm at BLK
Uh, everything is fine
The agreement was signed, and my division is fine
Say that shit in person man, hopefully
I'm a damn genius, damn
I'm not the type to murder you, I'm more of the type to plan it
I succeed in my pocket and these rappers panic
But Belly told me to do
And don't listen to anyone who knows me
Because knowing me would mean that there is a new me
And if you think I've changed, the least bit could have fooled me
Yes, and for my city I am 2-3
Drug dealers live indirectly through me
No bench time, nickname "Starter Drake"
Franchise, I don't even have a break
And these other niggas are barely mentioned
I bet with this pen you could get attention
But it showed through my prop
I'm just chilling out on the cut, nigga, what, and I feel like
I get it, I get it, I get it until I'm done
Tell them rappers, I'm the man from the city that I run.
So you yell at me to screw me if you plan a visit
And they say you can talk when you live it
I'm trying to tell you that I do this, but you don't want to go there, buddy
I'm trying to tell you to do this, but you don't want to go there, buddy
Here I go, street mower
Dancing around here, we need three courts
The house looks like a resort
When this money runs slower than Eeyore
Lord pressure bitch I'm cooler
They must have heard that they will never catch up
Someone throw a signal at the receiver
I'm on the plate right now, fuck the next one
I get it, I get it, I get it until I'm done
Tell them rappers, I'm the man from the city that I run.
So you yell at me to screw me if you plan a visit
And they say you can talk when you live it
I'm trying to tell you to do this, but you don't want to go there, buddy
I'm trying to tell you that I do this, but you don't want to go there, buddy
I'm trying to tell you that I do this, but you don't want to go there, buddy
I'm trying to tell you that I do this, but you don't want to go there, buddy
I waited for you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We should have done this already
I said I received an email today
Kind of thought that you forgot about me
Like you, I feel lonely
Baby I could really meet you
Take my time and I'll show you
When i feel lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Like you, I feel lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Like you, I feel lonely
Ready for us to do it
I have no love to call it stable
I hope it won't be like this for a long time
I will be your friend if you leave me
I don't want to come strong
Because many people want to catch me
But you know I do what I have to do
Like you, I feel lonely
Baby I could really meet you
Take my time and I'll show you
When i feel lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Like you, I feel lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Like you, I feel lonely
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
I feel lonely too
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Baby I could really meet you
Take my time and I'll show you
Don't tell anyone what we do
When i feel lonely
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Like you, I feel lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Like you, I feel lonely
I feel alone
I feel alone
Like you
Yes i appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I spoke in public
I think nowadays it's, you know, better to keep quiet
But sometimes you just have to let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is
Look, I'm owned by October
I don't drive here, they drove me
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and a few shots
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke sweets, without glaucoma, I am a shareholder
Private flights back home, nonstop
Still spitting out that shit that Pac got shot
The shit that my mother seems surprised
One migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm double, I'm the new eleven
And if I die, I'll do it repainting, I never do a second
I swear niggas are looking at me all hard
And lie to the girls and drive the same cars
Sitting there wishing his problems would become ours
‘Because we have nothing in common since I became a star
I got bigger, turning, writing in the lane of my classmates
The same guys who used to shout my engineer's name
One touch could make curtains and sheers change
And show me the city that I fearlessly claim
What I set seems never to die out
The coolest kid, baby, word for Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, look at the fingers cut in paper
My song is your girlfriend's bell
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She will be here at six in the morning if I leave her
But I'm never attracted to fans
I always knew I could imagine
How to get these label heads to give you good numbers
And me doing the shows making everyone nervous
Because hipsters are going to have to get along with them.
Make pasta, rent a movie, call the hoes
Burn bread every day, boy; without toaster
G and Tez got a GIS, but I'm not a smoker
They're just giving me fries, nigga; no poker
I'm on it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup spills
The same niggas I play with, I fall
In some southern shit
These cases do not work, I hope we can agree
Enough to pay any judge Judy
The first thing I will do is free Weezy, go
And I would take probation
Private plane, choose location
I'm going to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah I don't do stunts I do stunts
And if the food is not on the stove, I look for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Shit, don't leave me unattended
And I'm a cheese head, word to Vince Lombardi
My gun goes crazy like it's retarded
Red light like I'm recording
I'm not recording, I'm just C-4in
Better dig in your pocket and pay tribute
Better cover your eyes, your face falls
No i didn't say i'm perfect
But I'm sure it won't tarnish
My gun received comments for your clothes
I'm so stoned I can throw up on a comet
K-Y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, newborn bitch
I'm going to get money, money I'm going to get
And get that toilet paper fast, like when Bones spits
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream: "To hell with the world with a long cock!"
Son of a bitch, it's me! Yes, bitch, it's me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy I eat
Firefighter burns your entire street
So fly, I'll go when I jump
Goodbye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shuffling the cards, to cut my queens
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
My arrogance just screams, motherfucker, do you hear it?
Woo, young Mule, baby
Uh huh
Um, uh-huh
Okay
Hello Mothafucka, hello, hello, how are you?
In these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
She opens her mouth and then I remove her brain
You haven't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rolling with me like 11 wheels
Find out where you live, I'll kill you in the kitchen
The feds are trying to cut us, but we're not even tripping
I'm going in, I'm going in
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
Make hoes wobble like a bridge in an earthquake
Never see me outside because I live at my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt
Look where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just making myself and you could never understand it
Chicks Are Banged, Bandit With Big Cock
Money flows like a cut doll, without bandage
Blowing purple clouds, black, I'm so high
I'm not cutting anyone in my cake
And I don't stand still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I'm just telling the truth, so I'm great in every place in the neighborhood
21 years old and I've never met a good cop
Wayne and I bowed like Kareem doing hook shots
Cover me, I'm going in and I bend when the hook drops
I'm going in, I'm going in
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
Bitch, I'm going in, I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
It's El Capitan, I have some damn lieutenants.
And if I said "I'm going in," then I meant it
And if I brought it in the club, then I will spend it
It costs a few hundred bands and I'm fucking in it
There's no need for a room, yeah you know I'm fucking in it
She's acting like no, but she knows she's fucking with it
She said "I saw it all", I said "No you didn't"
Have you ever busted ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said "I can't feel my legs", I'm like "Bitch, neither can I"
I'm going in, where should I start?
Yes, I do my thang, jump like BEM!
Bitch I said I'm him so I'm nothing like them
I'm going in, I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
And I'm going to go hard, and I'm going to go hard
Bitch, I'm going in, I'm going in
I'm going in, I'm going in
The clock you've been watching has stopped
Makes you wait, what kind of man does that to a girl he loves?
If you only give me tonight, I promise you my hands will say
They'll say
Less than a minute, take off your clothes
We are about to start without false alarms
Despite the fact that downtown traffic shows no mercy
And I not only fuck you like this on your birthday
Baby, I just landed
And i'm on the way
Do not sleep
Yeah i see you calling me
I promise it's worth the wait
Because I'm on the way (2x)
Your days are over, baby, it's over
I've decided to give you all of me
I'm ready for you
Kill them all, light it up
Put it on, close it
Let my perfume soak in your sweater
Let's say you'll be here soon, the sooner the better
There are no options for, you say no
Follow my example, what are you waiting for?
I thought about it and decided that tonight is night
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, heart, it's beating
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, heart, it's beating
Yeah I hear you talk I don't know who you're trying to flatter
I made up my mind, I-I, I'm ready for you
I'm in control but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand that I, I'm ready for you
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for you

Mental images, without cameras please
I'm in control but with you being a man
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for you
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinking you're the man
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
You say you wanted fast? Define fast
Because I could speed it up and make it last And I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make sure you never forget it, committed
I'm ready, I'm ready, still here like a statue
You say you have luggage, well I'm packed too Also, I have a sex gun pointed straight at you
Explosion! The meanest woman in the heart of the south
Tested over and over again, that's why it's hard to hesitate
Also, I'm Young Money to death, I took the Carter route
I am more than ready too, I hope it is something you have thought about
Yeah I hear you talk I don't know who you're trying to flatter
I made up my mind, I-I, I'm ready for you
I'm in control but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand that I, I'm ready for you
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for you

I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinking you're the man
Because everything is part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for you
D.E.P. the girl you used to see
Your days are over. Baby she finished
I've decided to give you all of me
I'm ready for you!
Kill them all, light it up
Put it on, close it
Let my perfume soak your sweater
Let's say you'll be here soon, the sooner the better
There's no choice for her, you say no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my example, what are you waiting for?
I thought about it and decided that tonight is night
Yeah I hear you talk I don't know who you're trying to flatter
I decided. I'm ready for you
I'm in control, but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand that I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
I'm ready for you
Because everything is part of my plan
I do it big, I turn it off
I wonder if you can handle me
Mental image, no cameras please
(Background voice)
Uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind
Flash, black lingerie and white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient with the passage of time, you say you want it fast
Define fast, because I can speed it up and make it last
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make sure you never forget him, committed, I'm ready, I'm with him
Still here like a statue, pink champagne, green ink on your tattoos
You say you have bags, well I'm packed too, plus I have a sex gun
I'm more than ready too, I hope something you thought about
Artist: Drake
I'm still pulling out the Ghost, and these enemies can't stand me
Yes i keep doing my thing
Responsible for everything you listen to, a mediocre talent, let me see if I can condition you
I took my city and never asked permission to
It started popping bottles, because it's the ATL tridition
Celebrate with Bob Ma, fuck him in So-ho
If there is no elevator in it, you cannot go
They only give me head, while those who hate me give me promotion
And man, my DJ should have won that
All these old heads keep their minds on one track
And I, I run Toronto, find me when you finish laps
Surround yourself with Neego, party with Azooka
Shout goes to 1Da, shout goes to Future
Scream goes out to Getti, motherfucker I'm ready
Whoever holds the torch can't seem to keep it stable
Cause I see the flame flicker, x girls arguing
These women took me from Holly Grove to the Picker Ring
I tried to send my nigga Short some syrup in Michigan, but my connection told me it would take a minute if you listen to me
Please start making yourself, I've been making myself
And I am a staple in my city, you can never regret me
But I have love for everyone, even if you're suing me
My brother P-rain knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Looking at your niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hopin on a plane to every Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please don't harass me
Just find if you have me, fuck you if you have me
I scream out at Brian E, I scream at Photo Will
Yell at Oliver, and 40, man, you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to B Plus
And life is good, everything is fine
I'm still flying, I'm so high
And I challenge anyone to try to cut my wings
Yes i keep doing my thing
I'm still flying, I'm so high
And I challenge anyone to try to cut my wings
Yes i keep doing my thing
Yes
I'm working on dying
I'm upset
Fifty thousand in my head, it's disrespect
I will always take money for sex
I have a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep trying to catch me by my soul
Each month
I'm supposed to pay his bills and get him what he wants.
I'm still like seven years doing what I want
My father still received child support from 1991 (one, one, one)
Out of town, people love to exploit a lot of shit and then come back
Word to Flacko Jodye, already saw us leave him
Niggas asking if I'm cool
I'm upset ('Set', set)
Hunnid a thousand in my head, it's disrespect (disrespect)
Are you trying to check?
This is real life, niggas think we play chess
What's next
I go on tour and say I'm drinking less
I end up releasing and getting photos of my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I shoot under my neck (Skrr)
Why do you keep shooting if you know that dead nigger? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gives you a little respect
I have a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep trying to catch me for my soul (for my soul)
Grateful for the women I know
I can't go fifty-fifty without ho (Ayy, ayy)
Each month
She doesn't even love me, she just stood in front (Front)
So you're asking me how I'm doing?
Half a million in my head I can accept yeah
'At least it makes me feel like someone did the best they could, yeah
I wanna waste half a million, be my guest
It made me want to buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just dialed (dialed, dialed)
Hate me, you never met me in the flesh (meat)
He said he has some things that he has to come here and pick up
I have a lot of blood and it's cold
I can't go fifty-fifty without ho
Trap, Trap, Money, Benny
This shit has me in my feelings
I have to be real with that, yeah
Kiki, do you love me? You're riding
Say you will never leave my side
Because I love you and I need you
And I'm depressed for you always
KB, do you love me? You're riding
Say you will never leave my side
Because I love you and I need you
And I'm depressed for you always
See, the new me is still the real me
I swear you have to feel me before they try to kill me
They have to make some decisions, they are running out of options
Cause I've been leaving and they don't know when it's stopping
And when you get to the top, I see that you've been learning
And when you showed up with your ex, he deserved it
TrapMoneyBenny
I buy you champagne but you love Henny
From the block like you Jenny
'Resha, do you love me? You're riding
Say you will never leave my side
Because I love you and I need you
And I'm depressed for you always
J.T., do you love me? You're riding

Two bad bitches and we kissed on the Wraith
Kissing, kissing on the spectrum, kissing, kissing on the spectrum
Code for the safe, code-code for the safe
I show you how that neck works
Fuck that Netflix and relax, what's your net net worth?
Because I love you and I need you
And I'm depressed for you always
Yes yes yes yes he's bad

Skate and Smoke and Rap
Shawty says the nigga she can't hit with
But Shawty, I hit him, I hit him like I can't fail
Now let me see you
Clap that ass, clap-clap that ass!
Bring that ass back!
Clap-clap-clap that ass, you're the only one I love
Come on, come on, come on!
Bring that ass back!
Trap, Trap, Money, Benny
This shit has me in my feelings
I have to be real with that, yeah
BlaqNmilD, you are a genius, are you digging me?
I don't even care, I need a picture with Drake
Because my Instagram is weak as shit
I'm just being real, my shit, look, -
I don't love these bitches, I said this year, it's all a matter
Without offending my nigga, it's just that the industry is small
We all want the same women
I know I have a couple of things Lil 'Wayne got into
I'm not ashamed to admit it, I'm the same
This shit is about successes and failures
Half a mill to act, I can't let them fuck that shit
Also, I love how my middle name looks when it's lit
Jim Moore made me dress like a protagonist
A little favor for a friend when I need a hand
Young Frank, the suits always cut well
New verses smash the hood like he's driving towards something
Bitches on the boy like I'm something's iverson
Like a Sixer, ever since I sold 680 on my first
Drizzy Drake, the only one who received the gift without the curse.
Style!
* Fragment letters *
Trend marker, Ben Frank getter
Whipper dapper, whipper dapper
I buy diamonds when I'm under pressure
See I'm in the cut, the boy in the cut
Jump in the whip when the ceilings go up and up
All this grinding for what?
It's fun when you niggas thought it was luck
And I compete with myself while you niggas compete with the trends
I know the truth, there is no use pretending with him
I'm still in the cut, the boy in the cut
Get on the whip when the ceilings go up ...
I have to stay awake, there is nothing that kills me
Pull it up smoothly, we hang out with the crocodiles, damn
I'm a real dog (/ dog), bitches get Chanel
I thought they got the YSL (you were)
I remember when the feds did this shit, I pray my kids didn't say
I remember when the feds did this shit, I pray my kids didn't say
You see the difference between you and me: I just hit rock bottom. After this, I have no other choice. I have people to keep, promises I have made and goals to keep. Hmm, what do you have? Return
What happens? This is drake
And I will let you know what you are about to witness
This here is a collaboration of Drake and DJ Smallz
So I'm from Canada, my man is from the south
You understand, the number one DJ in the south to be exact
My man Smalls is out there to the south
At the same time, reppin 'for Toronto, Canada
So right here, listening right now is the official special edition of Southern Smoke
I call it the mixtape "Room for Improvement", because I'm not perfect.
So you just have to accept what's in there, you know what I mean?
From track one, to track whatever, however, many I put here
You just need to listen to this because look man, this is the first time
Canadian, south, my man, Smallz, your boy, Drake
You know what man is, so just tune in black
This goes for pretty girls
Which one which of you
See you at the club, oh Shawty
Walking past a nigga looking at me all naughty
So I said, "Baby, how are you?"
Bottles of the Ace caught me with a buzz
Girl, when the valet picks up the Benz
Girl, sit back, relax, wait
Let me turn on the radio
Girl, when I take you to the crib
(I take you to the crib)
Up to bed
(Upstairs to bed)
Girl when I remove the sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
You will think that I invented sex
You will think that I invented sex
Put the code on the door, go up to the entrance
Said she likes the way I touch her, listening to the beginning
(Yep)
I have a confession
Know that we are about to sin, but your body is a blessing
(Father, forgive me)
Girl can we go upstairs
(Up, up, upstairs)
My bed is waiting there
(Waiting there, yes)
All I want to do is
(All I want to do)
Won't you give me everything about you?
I want your body like now
(Right now)
You know I live a magnum lifestyle
(Lifestyle)
Baby turn off the lights
And i will excite you
Girl, when I take you to the crib
Up to bed
(Upstairs to bed)
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
Girl when I remove the sheets
(Take off the blankets)
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
You will think that I invented sex
Because i do as i did
You will think that I invented sex
It's a celebration applaud, applaud, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of muscat
For the girl who is a student and the friend who is a model
Finish the whole bottle and we'll make it big like this
Yes and he was just practicing
He is not in your world, you can get him out of your atlas
Girl on fire, can I be the one you match?
I'll give you the credit card and baby, you can maximize this
Show me where your tattoos are
Show me where you are going, maybe I can understand it
Stuck on your ex yet? I can make you pass
Yes, and all your friends suggest
What is the chance that this black is better than the rest?
Just tell them you appreciate the help
But you just have to know for yourself
Girl, when I take you to the crib
(I take you to the crib)
Up to bed
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
Girl when I remove the sheets
And you climb on top of me
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
Girl, you're going to think, girl, you're going to think
You will think that I invented sex
You will think that I invented sex
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing
I am still flying, I am very high and I challenge anyone to try to cut my wings
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing
I still am…
Clean on this bitch, I feel damn rich black
And every time I touch it I guarantee to be hit
And when checks are guaranteed to be a division
I'm a flyer so an invitation
As if I were the information
Toronto has been waiting and I'm glad you've been waiting patient
But I'm here now, these niggas are old news
I mix cocaine powder with professional tools
(Whip) Yeah crack this is how I turn around
Europeako jeans bleeding into them white air max
And these niggas keep asking me when you're gonna fall
Why the fuck do you keep harassing me when it's going to stop?
And they say damn it, I used to know the boy
Now I hardly see them
And little boys want to be him
Hook
I am still flying, I am very high and I challenge anyone to try to cut my wings
I'm still pulling out the ghost and these enemies can't stand them
Nigga, I'm still doing my thing
I am still flying, I am very high and I challenge anyone to try to cut my wings
I'm still closing cities every time I come
I still am…
Fly as I want to be Kush in the air, I rise as I want to be
Representative T point until they bury me
Automate red diamond doll on the necklace
I've been getting checks while you rappers stay out of control
Real street nigga, feel free to make a checklist
Don't really make them like me
I had to give you a second to breathe
Nigga is still a hobby and I do it with ease
I'm about to get pneumonia because my neck freezes
I'm in the west indies
100 thousand in a cheap white t-shirt
Nigga I represent my city as a soccer team
I'm flying like the New York Jets
In a G5 two nines in me like Wayne Gretzky
I just put up with what I do is my part of the deal
I just beg you to do it is I beg your pardon
I only try what I do if I try the hardest
Only the problems I do are math problems with gains
Only what I can do is my lack of answers
The only break I make is "Where's the rest of my commas?"
I still get up, the vibrations of Maya Angelou
When life comes to you from all angles and sides
And they don't want to see that you smile from the inside
It really comes down to how you plan to survive
Love certain but never get attached to them
Give them nice things, but what is that to them?
Especially when another girl I flew in is fluttering in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom.
All hell begins to break loose in my texts
I'm only telling lies to whom I have to protect
I'd rather you remind me of how we met
I'd rather lose my leg than lose his respect
But that will never happen the way I'm watching my step
That's not what i'm doing
I'm in control of my destiny, I never doubt
If I can't do it with you, I will do it without
They say take good with bad, I'll take it without
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the south
Is there more to life than digits and bank accounts?
Is there more to life than saying I found out?
The sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the cabin, ready to take advantage of the truth.
Too many letters about houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters, mice, and fools
I mean, you know I love challenges, but who challenges them?
But even if you take all their stats and take both
Even if you rounded the numbers and rounded the troops
It's a pity that reality checks don't cover balances owed
Every time it's time to recover
Yeah as soon as this album goes down i'm out of the deal
At home playing D'Angelo, "How do you feel?"
I was afraid of having things on my mind when I die
Does it make any sense to do these songs when I'm high?
Is there anything more to life than going on a trip to Dubai?
Yachts on July 4, G5 soars through the skies
Is there more to life than all these corporate ties?
And all these lucky times
And all these asses that never have a proportionate size?
Is there something more to life than just when I feel alive?
There is more?
Instant passion
Sweat beads, feel me (feel me)
Cupid shot me
Tempt me, take me (Tempt me)
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly (Highly)
It's completely yours
I will be, I will be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover for you
Oh yeah
Yes
Leaving me (leaving me)
Dippin 'on me (on me)
I already gave you what you needed, I guess (Ooh yeah)
That's why I'm not with anyone (Ooh, yeah)
Cause I don't wanna hurt no one (Ooh yeah)
I did it by text message, he didn't call me (Ooh yeah)
I still have love for you, mommy
Even if you have to leave someone (body) yes
Most of these things I don't want to say (Jaded)
I want to be close while you chase him (While you chase him)
You wanna hit me when you do
You'll try to come back when you're famous
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (Dangerous, oh)
You got something real, not basic (Ooh yeah)
You wanna go with me stop
Yeah it hurts, yeah I'm tired (Jaded)
Most of these things, I don't want to say (say)
(I want to be close, I want to be close)
You wanna hit me when you do (Ooh yeah)
You'll try to come back when you're famous
(Back, back)
I always want the truth but it's dangerous (dangerous)
You want to go with me, stop (Flakin ')
Yes, dogs on this side, dogs on this side
(Ooh yes, ooh yes, ooh yes)
Ayy, you told me about all your insecurities, what for?
He dragged me like two hours to his family's house, for what?
He said you need some time, but I should stay, why?
I always felt that sticking around is the same as being stuck
And like guns with the ink inside, you're getting under my skin
Pretty little young thing (young thing)
I had a convinced nigger, I was too excited
Lowdown, dirty, embarrassing, crazy
I need to know how the new nigga you got does the same thing
I make a living but it's much less wavy
How you even manage to keep faces straight
In all the pictures I saw lately
God knows you still look amazing
That is in addition to the point that I am making
You're too stubborn to have to force it, to have to pretend
You had potential, I could have molded it
You went and gave in (Ooh yeah)
We could wait, I was not in a hurry, difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You have shared stories where you were surprised
Things to be loyal, things to be patient
Shifted focus, lens looked jaded (jaded)
You'll try to come back when you're famous
You want to go with me, stop (Flakin ')
Your new shit sounds like you're making covers
Of all my old shit, oh shit
I'm dedicated to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
I should run a clinic for niggas who think they're winning
In trainer shit, 50 ms for a three-month road trip
I see through them like fish tanks without fish
Drizzy still has some '06 on it
IRS all in my books they get Matlock on
All this capital is like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I make a comeback, it seems like I change the game
See I can still speak the keys without throwing a cane
Pay yourself and you must
Before coming to my city just know yourself
Know where you are
I'm good in every city, I'll be there doing shows where you
Lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga
That's where all that shit comes from ... man, I mean
Absolutely phenomenal, because we go through everything
We go through errythang ...
I remember you loved Jodeci
I mean, as a student, you even made me a CD ...
Your money is just a small Barney Cooperative for you to try to show
I'm in your girl's ear planting seeds like a crop
We move the operation to Cali when the snow falls
Oh, stop, stop arguing about who is the best MC
I think everyone would agree, they know you're not
I know I'm a sure shot, middle finger pushing you on your sore spot
The bars sound like I'm under black oath
Either I'm getting bigger or you're just getting smaller or it's both black
I'm as unforgiving as most blacks
You bit your hand, now you're starving, it's not a black joke
I'll hang you up after I show you the ropes, nigga
Oh well bitches paint OVO on their toenails
And perform at the show, the after party and the hotel
I got to the lobby, the women screamed like Jodeci's back, black
Jodeci is back
Bitches screaming like Jodeci's back
I call the front desk for condoms, she says they don't have any
From the way I'm responding, she knows we're black, black
(Damn, you mean you don't have condoms)
Jodeci is back
Fuck hoes like Jodeci's back
I paint pictures and flip words
Nigga thought Def Poetry would come back (Cole)
Roof, raised hoes
Looking for your bitch, I bet she won't show up
I wonder where it is, could it be?
She's a whore, she's a whore, she's a weirdo
It counts a hundred thousand dollars like it sucks to be me
Isn't that what you wanted? Stuntin 'on you niggas
Got into this game never facing you niggas
I gave you heart and soul, stories of my pain
I felt naked because I exposed all my glory and my shame
Trapped fire just so niggas ignore me and my flame
'About to burn down the house, they try to put me in the rain, no
I'm undoubtedly the hottest and it's just me being modest
Go see the numbers, fictional, I'm just starting
I'm artistic, you ****** ** ******** ********
Hold your applause
There's no need to pause when I tell you my balls bigger than yours, Cole
Without false gods, young Mike playing against the Monstars
Tappin 'in '94 Nas
Which is really Slim Shady, I'm dumb, my crazy feather
Today I am in Philadelphia, my fans wait 12 hours
Just to get your dollar signed
Thoughts flow like it's Spotifyin '
Trench coat flow, bottom line
Flow dumber than your projections
This does twice now, I doubled what you expected, still
Your blankets mystify me
Maybe it's too complex for me
But is it about combat or sales skills?
You legends know we rap
Bitches screaming like Jodeci's back
But you pick them up
They will know that you are trying to help them
Try to stay light on tiptoe
I just turned on a light on a Rolls
He said I look exhausted
You hit him right on the nose
I'm tired of all these niggas
I'm tired of all these hoes
Worried about taking my lane
They haven't even hit the road
They turn them and leave you
They will come back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Yes, all my brothers, we are equal
I do my part too, as a sequel
You tell your niggas that you got them on anything
The question is, do they believe you?
'Especially when you never come
So much hate inside your heart
We don't even know what we've done to you
We only know that the shit is running
Never chase him, let him come to you
You are here telling everyone everything
You niggas move like one-two yeah
When you see them fall
But you pick them up
You still let them touch the ground
Don't worry i swear
They will know that you are trying to help them
They will know that you are trying to help them
They will know that you are trying to help them
They will know that you are trying to help them
And more melody for your head
Look how you speak on my behalf, you know?
Boi-1st ... Drizzy
They really don't like me
My flow is sitting inside my pants pocket
I write your favorite records, are you saying ghost?
I'm getting rich, huh, you're going broke
I can't see you through the Mosley tribes
So I don't even flinch if you throw me crashing all five
They try to live up to it, but no one is my size.
Whatever the 40s are smoking to lower my eyes
Every thing a nigga buys is a write-off
Landed like the pavement of the runway, I'm taking off
Baby go ahead turn off the light
Because he's about to leave
I hear my phone ring when you call
I'm not picking them up or entertaining them at all
I got your girl upside down hitting the wall
While you and all your friends are at the Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I can't relate
Ridin 'with some labels I got from out of state
Ridin 'with a loot I got from outer space
Just show me who is the best, I will leave him out of his place
Call me Drizzy murder, I'm about to kill your ego
I'm on my green puffin like it's Cee-lo
You can go and take a look at your hero
Fantasy for you, reality for me
And yes, my G pass is as valid as it can be
I'm so cool, a stylist would agree
Waving to your girl while she smiles at me like
I'm really stepping up my game
I can't get more for free, Randy
I can't complain, I can't
I don't even know how much I really earned, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, no matter what I got
It came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (yeah)
Without help, that's all me, all me for real
It came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me (2 Chainz)
Without help, that's all me, all me for real
J's pinky ring chasing these hoes I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't play the same
(Ah) She wants all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
Okay, I made a million with a fork for dinner, watch me change it
I just bought a shirt that costs a Mercedes-Benz car grade
From A to Toronto, we let the metal fire
And my cock so strong it makes the metal detector go off
There's that sauce, this dressing
Givenchy, nigga, God bless you
I have everything, I have everything
I can't complain, I can't
I don't even know how much I really earned, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, no matter what I got
Nigga, don't look at that because I ...
It came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
Without help, that's all me, all me for real
It came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
I even fucked the girl who used to babysit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
They pay me a lot, they pay you a little
And my last shit is like a big hit
Damn, there's no wish on this side
You don't screw with us, so we don't screw with you
No different on this side
Damn, should I listen to everyone or myself?
Because I just said to myself:
Keep talking about who will be next, but I'm as big as it seems
I swear they're just losing their breath
I'm Keith Sweat with light skin, I'm going to make it last forever
It's not your turn because I'm not done yet
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle
And I'm on the road to box office sales
I get paid for all this shit
I was making room for the table dancers
Because if we judge your progress
Then they paid me like eight advances, damn it!
I have everything, I have everything
I can't complain, I can't
I don't even know how much I really earned, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, no matter what I got
It came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
Without help, that's all me, all me for real
It came up, that's all me, be honest, that's all me ...
Ho, shut your mouth!
I have too much on my mind
I learn from what I've been through
I will do what I did not do
And still waking up like rent due
It is not complicated, it is simple.
I have sexy ladies, all a full Benz
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm old-fashioned
I paint pictures, I see the shit, good sex, I need to hit
Keep a spacious one on the floor year round as season tickets
I beg the fifth, drink a fifth, charge nine
I leave you divided, in half, smoke in half, you need a zipper
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and that shit
I swear to God I have 99 problems, but a bitch is not a
I have 99 problems, getting rich is not one
As if I had trust issues
I feel sorry for the people that I have pushed
I'm the type to have a bulletproof condom
And I still have to get out
But it's just me and I'm not perfect
I'm not a saint but I'm worth it
If it's one thing, I'm worth it
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I've screwed up too many 305 women
'Before the end of this year
I'll make King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking in that kush everything in our section
As if it was legalized
Girl you can't always get away with it
They don't really fuck you like that
They've never done me like this
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like this
They taught me never to lend to someone
What you need back
And I need that shit back
(No more free Randy) I'm blessed than a muhfucka
Niggas has been stressed that a muhfucka
Niggas get nervous
Grabbing their chests like a muhfucka
Damn that's a motherfucker
Because I don't like to be lied to
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail, we were talking out the window.
That was back then, man
Rock me very slowly
Put me a bib
I'm like a baby, droolin 'on you
The things you do
These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason why you love me
Listen, you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
I still find myself, much less a soul mate, I'm just saying
Feel that we are one and the same, our relationship changed
That or never existed
Every time they say something about us you listen
But fuck what they talk about in your timeline
Fuck what they talk about in your timeline
That's cut all my time with you
My time with you, my
Rock me very slowly
Put me a bib
I'm like a baby, droolin 'on you
The things you do
I love you through everything, I did everything for her
She forgave me for everything, this is something forever
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She of the jungle, she of the jungle
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to speak, are you close?
Are you depressed about the cause?
You're sad? You're sad? You're sad?
Are you depressed about the cause?
Are you depressed about the cause?
Are you still down? Are you still down? Are you still down?
Rock me very slowly
Put me a bib
I'm like a baby, droolin 'on you
The things you do
Yes, these days these new girls made me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of order
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do
After doing everything we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Rock me very slowly
I'm like a baby, droolin 'on you
The things you do
How was your pop night?
??: What day is today?
??: October 2, 2008
??: I'm going to take the same video on October 2, 2009 and see if we can get into this without ID (?)
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I should have already returned
But you know how much I wanted to do it
Probably better anyway
So if you have to go
If there is something I should know
If attention makes you nervous
If you are looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the teapot and turn it on
But do you already feel it?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now i'm singing karaoke
Beyond what I've been
If there is any way I can help
That tells me my life is too much and then I move to Atlanta.
I just thought you would choose a place
I had someone you know
I'm always awake too late, I worry about you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold pattern
I hope you're not known for anything crazy
But that first cut is the deepest.
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets that you were telling everyone except me
Don't be fooled by money, I'm still young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't say
I was just trying to get ahead
I was just trying to get ahead
But the attention makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose
I was just trying to get ahead
I was just trying to get ahead
But the attention makes you nervous
It's a little cold outside
How can you stand there is beyond me
How can you not control me when things go wrong?
Much closer
All my "let's be friends" are friends that I no longer have
I guess that's what they say you need family for
Because I can no longer depend on you
I always saw you for what you could have been
Like when Chrysler made that car
That looked like the Bentley
And even when it comes to business, it's personal again
I met you before I made ends meet
And now we find our end
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
I guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that was not mine
You are so predictable that I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How are you supposed to find out what I'm going through
You judge me before you know me, yes it seems
I do all the player anthems for the real niggas
With my father in Tennessee is where I belong
I do not know what is happening
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
I guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that was not mine
My luck is safe because I'm living well
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every time
Everyone I met along the way tries to get in the way
I'm eating and serving them all
Like I'm working for a minimum wage
Someone up there must need some entertainment
Sorry for your ways
If I ever loved you, I will always love you; that's how I grew up
In the same way that I'm here, I still feel the way
In the same way I am realizing in a day to day that
All my "let's be friends" are friends that I no longer have
How can you not control me when things go wrong?
Much closer
All my "let's be friends" are friends that I no longer have
I guess that's what they say you need for your family
Because I can no longer depend on you
Much closer
Every time people want to start trouble
It's like "really, are you stupid?"
You know who the men are
I'm not afraid, no man with a gyal heart
And I'm not afraid of any cyattie
So anyone who wants it can get it
Seh feh
Uh, how about you guys? Yes
Soundtrakk, what's popping up baby?
If you don't know
My name is Lupe Fiasco
Representing that first and fifteenth, yes, huh
And this one here, I dedicate it here
To all my friends out there grinding
You know what I'm talking about?
So take a look at it, huh
I first got it when I was six, I didn't know any tricks
In fact, the first time he climbed on it, he slipped
He landed on his hip and broke his lip
For a week, he had to speak to a lisp, like this
Now we can finish the story right here
But shorty didn't give up, it was something in the air
Yes, he said it was such an attractive thing.
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it.
Marked, from the first kickflip that landed, huh
Tagged as a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't bear it
So, he was banished to the park
And then he kicks, pushes, kicks, pushes
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
And rolled away
And then he kicks, pushes, kicks, pushes
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
uh uh uh
What's up, Lupe?
Chi-Town, check
My style is very Tennessee mixed with some Terry Kennedy
I have some contacts and I threw away the glasses
The time it took me to refresh was a massive delay, but look
It gets boring growing up in Memphis
Tryna becomes a professional, but continues to appear as an apprentice
Mom probably would have done anything to avoid this
Because every time I break a board, it becomes expensive
Luckily my aunt worked as a nurse
So every time she needed something, she just looked in her bag
And besides, she always gave me speeches on the first
If I stay at your house, then I need to work.
She said, "You need to be doing something other than skating.
Why don't you go kick it with your uncle in the basement?
I'm going to let him know you're coming, darling, he's waiting. "
So now it's me in old school picture frames
Playing chess, looking at some old-school record ads
I knew I really didn't want to post here
He opened the window and told me that the coast was clear
And now I'm calm, I breathe deeply
This is every test that life has given me
A-plus qualified by a teacher with a sweet dress
Kick and cheat, a kickflip in the air
Kid's sick denim pants, put a tear in a pair
Just so space is not restricted here, breathe again
I think it's obvious that they need my soul
My cousin is behind Doe, like re-mi-fa-so
I said, "Auntie, this is a safe race."
She said "Drake, I told you there was no skatin 'here"
So I kick, push, kick, push
Quick as wheels replaced
I have to find another hobby just to fill the gap
So I kick, I push
Kick, push Kick, push
Kick, push Costa
Look at the way I roll
And coast
Before you knew it, you had a non-punk crew
In them Spitfire shirts and SB mattes
They would push until they couldn't skate anymore
Lobbies in office buildings were no longer safe
And it wasn't like they weren't chasing them anymore
Only freedom was better than breathing, they said
An escape route they used to escape
When things went crazy, they needed to explode
They would go anywhere with stairs
Any good routine, the world was yours
And their four wheels would take them there
And then they kick, they push, they kick, they push
And they rolled away
Just rebels with no cause and nowhere to go
And then they kick, they push, they kick, they push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be
And push, yes, yes
Ah ha, Swanky
Let's go
Alright alright alright alright
Look
Uh
I feel sorry for the second place
I'm still awake, making money while the sun comes up
And they keep saying how they need me to deliver
Because they hate when the rookie star doesn't put the numbers
Man, hate is so old-fashioned, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day
Nigga and it's just me and my money
You can't even play when you lead by 20
Yes, I infiltrated the game.
At first I doubted and feared what would change
Now I'm far from success and disappeared from fame
And still I managed to keep all my opinions the same
I'm so far away bitch, I'm out of here
Hotter than standing inside swinging outerwear
Nor can I continue talking with you thousands of people.
Wow, I swear I'm killing shit, I'm killing shit
I scream at the niggas I just made a couple million with
I know I'm making history, not making friends
Muthafuckaaaa ...
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
Yes, ok, ok, ok
Demon just came out of the can (Yeah)
I study right in my yaad
I'm doing ten in a week
How long have I been on this streak?
Dream about work while I sleep (Oof)
Ok i have a padlock on the streets
And brought it because of me
You know nothing about me
Life for my bruddas is deep
While everyone is standing
As long as the pockets are big (Great!)
Dust off a man with the feather, it's a sweep (Mmm!)
Taller in person, you'll see when we see each other
Jheeze!
Do you know the dem Hahaha
Bringing that dirty, bringing that certy (Certy)
Mizzy with the quick extension, ringing thirty (Rah!)
Spen jumped into the Ghost in a suit, sporting a whole church (oof!)
Fingers all itching, trembling, looking all spasmodic (spasmodic)
I was pushing that dark shit, pushing that coal (Yeah)
Look at them jokers, look at that asshole
Man is getting bread now, and this is that hard dough (yeah)
Clapping, dominant murder
I'm a black man, a government worker
He could have slapped the man, but he wanted him more (Why?)
Batman, da-na-na-da-na

Boi-1da, what's going on?
Yes Yes
Running through the 6 with my problems
Counting money, you know how it goes
Pray real life forever, man
I want that Ferrari, then I detour
I'm not rocking my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my place and don't deserve it
I don't like the seriousness with which they are taken
It's always been me, I guess I know myself
Tremors, man, I don't have time for that
My city also appeared, I will take the fine for that
That's where you find me
I know a black man named Johnny Bling
Put me to good things
I had a job selling Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye fell, it was polo shirts and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushing a Subaru hatchback
Man I'm talking long before the hashtags
I was running through 6 with my problems
(Yes!)
I was running through 6 with my problems
You know how that should go
Running through the 6 with my problems
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they're irrational too, woah
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
The representatives are here
I have P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and whoa
He could declare it a holiday as soon as Baka gets back on the road.
Yeah but you know how that should go
They are so irrational that they don't want to fix it
They wanna pound it, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whips him, I ride the passenger
I am very high, I stay high, I am two years old, I am three years old
I had to come back to you, woah
I'm turning into a nigga who thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
This is how shit happened
And know
Running through the 6 with me, with me
I was running around 6 with my problems
And you know how that should go
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Running through the 6 with my problems
You know how that should go
You know how that should go
Running through the 6 with my problems
You know how that should go
... outside, all if your eye is big
Haffi always be careful, you don't know if your head is free
Dun know, a rebel boss, man
No bomboclat, otha
And if a boy doesn't like OVO or Chromatic
Yuh, can you suck yuh mada!
No apologies, if you don't like it, we don't want you or the young people either
Your girl says that we are cute, if you don't, you will be executed
(Machine guns)
With my afflictions
When I appear in a nigga, tell that nigga back, back
I'm too good with these words, look at a black recoil
If I die, all I know is that I'm a legendary legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga that represents
OMG OMG if I die I'm a legend
OMG OMG if I die I'm a legend
I used to work, I used to dance in Texas, now I clean the house
On my way, money taught me Spanish, go ahead
I walk north, full of Honda cars
They don't know who we are
Shoot 'em all, only niggas kittens shoot the star
Right or wrong, I'm going to write my mistakes
They can't live that long
I got this shit drawn hard
I'm too good with these words, look at a black recoil
All I know, if I die, I'm a damn legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga that represents
OMG OMG if I die I'm a legend
OMG OMG if I die I'm a legend
I am the one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?

OMG OMG if I die I'm a legend

You're from Timmins and I'm from Toronto.
You worked at McDonald's and I as McDonald's
We should be together, I think we should be together
All these other girls are totally crazy, oh, oh, oh
Only you can make me feel how I feel
Damn I'm dying to make you feel like a woman baby
Southern smoke!
I'm going to tell people that we are blocking this
This other one of your boy V-O
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, all this love (loving me)!
Cause I'm in and out of town, that's how I gotta get down
But you understand, that's why I'm your man!
I can't believe it's just you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, all this love (loving me)!
UH, UH, UH (Yes man!)
YES YES (Haha. It's just you and me, girl)
YES YES (keep rocking at this rate)
UH, UH, UH (Do you want me to fall in this rhythm?)
UH, UH, UH (HO!)
YES YES (Let me put a little gospel on them. Yes. Uh)
They say he wanted to rebound
Without knowing exactly where my accounts are
Yes, it is best to believe
That I often tend to overcome what the rest achieve
So they don't like me
I can't lie, sometimes it bothers me a little
Either way, the real fans scream
And no, this is not Blu Cantrell
A couple of things that I do very well
And from the way I am Jack, you imagine Drake knew Sam. L
Although I'm real
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill, so
Look, I'm humble, but I live fame
For more table deals than the abridge game. Ahh
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, all this love (loving me)!
I can't believe it's just you and me, and I know
I can't explain all this love (loving myself).
And even if the sun is out, we can do anything baby
I need to feel you by my side, you want to feel me by your side
We can do whatever you want to do
Tell me next morning baby!
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I can't believe it's just you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, all this love (loving me)!
I am grateful to be able to call America my second home. Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling's death, it left me feeling down, emotional and really scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something.
It is impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and the police is still as tense as it was decades ago. No one starts life as a hashtag. However, the trend to reduce to one continues.
My thoughts and prayers go out to the Sterling family and any families who have lost someone in this cycle of violence.
Be safe out there More life.
I get up every morning, I take a shower, I collect my belongings
Head to the works, I get some breakfast cause I'm still a yawning nigga
Since last night, in the club where I was awake, I am trying to live
Just twenty-two my nig, how about being twenty-three?
I get up every morning, I take a shower, I collect my belongings
Since last night, in the club where I was awake, I am trying to live
Just twenty-two my nig, how about being twenty-three?
Time doesn't wait for any of us, that's why I have to chase my dreams
Make my mom proud so she can show all her pearly teeth
And I know half the man my dad was, thank God he was in my life
I realize how many are leaving, wives so deep
Either I need to make this music work or move from Earth
My congregation bombarded the nation with this hip hop
We are on the race to fame, passing pit stops
I heard that the prize was girls and a wristwatch.
And all you have to do is go to jail or get shot
Yes, Nick, cop, but it's never busted
How are we going to get pop fans? Give them a quick chance
Now I make you hot with my wristwatch
Yes, little drip when it ticks
He's a little sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the fights
And tell them niggas, this is Nick's place
They don't keep it cool enough. I have it closed.
I got to do it and I noticed that his cock was stuck
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
I'm trying to get that money, then I watch how high it grows
As soon as we have the ass, we start calling them
The concept you don't understand, I guess you're too old
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
Ayo I stay awake every night, I write that shit they believe in
The DJs handle it, they come up to me and it's a compliment that I'm getting
Well guess again slide down the back and make it break
And all the cellophane wrapped bottles and party where the best have been
One hundred greats, Nickle F, that black is the next to win
Virgina is going to represent him, and Memphis represents to me
In tenth grade, Tennekey, T Dot the country, you guys
I'm not ashamed, my city is not on the map
So they turn the torch and sell their soul enough to deposit cash.
Maybe they can bring their career back
But these niggas here aren't trying to hear that
Because I'm on set, make it work, even 9-5
Cigarettes and lottery tickets, try to keep that routine alive
All my uncles go to the casino when they pass them.
This can't be life, dominoes and boss and dro and twenty stacks
Single moms call cheats just to get their honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to stack money
You think it's fun until these pups suck on a bunny
Take the hare out and scream where the money is?
Yes it's a dizzy baby
Ah, ha, uhh, I'm ready, okay, I just got it
Look, I really am the heir to a millionaire's fortune.
At the border like, "I swear, I have nothing to declare
Loyal as a motherfucker, no one will be saying shit
Silly boys know me because I often speak their language
Well spoken man, he should have gone to Cambridge
Y-o-u-n-g ho, women can be so
Motivated by money, that's why they're with me
If he's the one I'm zero, (pshh damn it)
Please understand that I am a general of Surf Club
I am Mr. consistent, I have never come in intervals
You don't want to be caught in the middle like a center fold
I commit suicide if we are ever identical
Click clack pow, how do you like a black now?
In control of my domain
And I know Toronto misses me, I'll be home in a minute
That's my city and I run it, you only run for it
They see me in person and say I still haven't heard you sing
The world is my playground, don't fuck with my swing
We get the pitching, so that's when it comes to stacking
I call your lantern don't act like you can't see me dialing
Hello to me
I never said it would be fair
But when you're alone I hope you really know
How bad I want to be there
Come in, put your bag down
But keep your heels on
They're fit for what I'm about to do, oh
Just shut up, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second to have fun?
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I've been waiting so long to have you alone
Now I finally have you right here
Because I want to make one thing clear
I want you up, so let your hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl, I'm gonna turn off the lights, but keep your heels on
They are fit for what we are about to do
Come in, put your bag down
But keep your heels on
They're fit for what I'm about to do, oh
You know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just shut up, I'll do fine without your help, girl
Can you work without a second to have fun?
Now you finally have a moment for yourself girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
Oh it's 6 in the morning in the studio
J.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in "Jodeci Freestyle". I share the responsibility and offer my sincere apologies for the pain this has caused. People with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be underestimated or discarded. This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I am grateful for the opportunity to try to correct this error. J. Cole and I believe that it is the correct, responsible and respectful decision to remove the lyrics from the song.
Niggas in town hate me man they stumble
When I'm the only one who really spits
My nigga Lil Lee is the only one that really is exciting
Why are you kidding me by acting like we're cool if you don't feel black?
Uh, I'm bringing hip hop back
VA, Toronto, Hip-Hop
Aiight, let me take off my jacket
Unleash the Timbs, here comes the jabberjaw again
This time I'm chattering
These rappers who feel a certain way but give me dap and everything
Crazy because freestyle is smaller than the whole catalog
The flow got spring like a catapult
In fact the Supreme Flow as Diana Ross
I'm on the do like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy if they were nigga
I wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar function
I know who you are because he wanted me to eat you
I said no, let's keep it alone
My nigga was a true source of grass
A true stray dog
The kind of nigga all of you are studying, learning to get off the street
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
About to hit him with the helicopter like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, the heat has a
Hurricane kick, kill everything fast
See, my new Ryu nine is great
Why do boys choose my crew to choose wit?
My team lies to you in ditches
I said it and wanted to say that the Scorpio Mind has many dimensions.
I'll say it with intention, prayer, indentation, in instant pimp
I hope you are listening to my diction
If so, now it should be itching
What is a crack that we place in your stereo system
Yes, I'll be at your funeral stumbling
Nickelus F from Richmond, VA
The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play all day
I have been hated by many, desired by many
Some don't like it, but no one faces it
Take pictures on them, I guess you could call it a parody
And compared to D
They are a quarter of a watermelon to a quarter of a criminal, friend, you are a pear to me
You have blind heaters, in my sweatshirts there's a mind reader
And when the psychic touches my palm
Especially when one of your artists feels threatened
Because I'm using a gun, won't you forgive my reflection?
Mirror, mirror tell me why they want to get and fight
And play, I am perfectly the living image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I spit image
It seems that we often want to start but never end
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feel Hova
Let me help you as a specialist
So you can remove it and try to catch the metaphors and the rest of this
Which means if things go wrong I say, "I was expecting this."
And Julien and I never had a chance to communicate
Instead of understanding it's a melody of hate
The city mine like Oklahoma is a former state
And we will have to cross paths sooner or later
So why don't you walk in place using less strut?
You are not Morris Chestnut, you are lighter and less cut
And let's be honest, now you should be your own scholar
You're still a protégé, that's why I don't scream
You have rappers being repetitive actors
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy
I swear to you Lord
See me at CL 6 with Haffa B
They know that money begets money so naturally
Me and Haffa could fly a couple of heaps with no problem
I'm like all of you hate on behalf of me
Because I could flood the city with a staff of three
I'm talking about me and two companions on that Capricho
And fast cars, fast women, fast cash and cream
I could mold rappers like modeling clay
I have to dream but dog
The inside of my wallet is grass / past your green
And now you're with the asthma team
Darling, catch your breath as I tear the scene apart
Call my city, Sparta, and I come with two spears.
I executed my invoice making calls to executives
And with me, women will be building these skeptical walls
Cheer up baby, don't you see all this income?
I started the game at level two
I am saying
Parallel to Flying + Spur + + Tony park + it
And it's great if you spill suttin it's just carpet
That's why I get my inner color just dark shit
Toronto is where you live today
And you're not making records that people feel compelled to play
I would advise you to really move sooner rather than later
Do you feel Me?
Are you familiar with this feeling?
Without hiding
It's all out in the open
That the virgin pussy awaits
And I'm about to prick it
I'm underrated I'm Ricky Henderson to Oakland
But I'm about to put them to sleep, get them and keep them
I require a retainer to remove and sweep them on a dust pan
New boy, too flying, who buys seven cars
Dubai seven stars
You die the sky is ours
And you don't see the tip fall here
It's like I'm chasing my dad the way I label appears here
Let's see how many carrots we can make.
Mixing green earth with that blue parachutist
Who are you? You confused friend, that's a thoughtful look there
Doors all suicidal
I should be your tour guide
I'm blown up
And take a seat on your throne
I've been through it all
Spend it all to do it all
It's not me man, it could never be you at all
And yes, you have a range, but that shit isn't even supercharged
Aight check, flow switch, flow switch
I never pay a percentage of the retail sale
Hours may change at the mention of an email
Book a show with some tension with a woman
My dad said that to get rich you have to dig deep
Because Drake these big streets
And you are not Big Meech
And you are not Rayful
And this is not DC
Four years later, a quarter of a million off television
I was writing group outlines
Get us off the buses and turn them into coupe equipment
Well there it is
Wow, now my troops are clean
First Audi drop car, color like a poutine
I feel like an adult, don't ask me for an ID, like you know who I am, gorilla, I know the owner
I never go, I felt out of place at a school dance
Because they know the design of the shopping center as if I knew France
Inside and out, therefore, I've been hiding
And you drive cars that I've been riding
Correction, they have taken me
I was showing, I sold the stories they told you shit
And dog, I've been old
Degrass my royalties
Homie, you only owe once
No weight movement
My shoulder counts
Man, I don't even know my name anymore man (laughs)
It took half an hour
Just so the belt buckles
The only thing he wants to talk about is party and fashion
I don't know where it goes
But I don't plan to ask at all
And she doesn't let anyone else in except me
I'm the only one who loves
Homie, that's a guarantee.
Don't forget that Fendi bag where you put all your cash
Other guys would suffocate her, I don't want her to be out of breath
And I don't plan to ask anything
I've never been the type, I feel the same
My connection with niggas who wanna fight
About women, that's not right
Homie, you can choose
I swear that's my girl!
The first time, the first time I met Robyn Fenty was in 2005. I was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was "Pon de Replay", and the director ... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the girl playing background music in the restaurant while people dined. It's hard to believe that eleven years later, the three of us would join the image of their song called "Work".
Captivating from day one, the iconic being Rihanna was already in a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, that is often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has continued to rise to an untouchable level ever since.
When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with each release. When it comes to performances, they huddle up en masse just to be in his presence ... obviously ... And when it comes to fashion and style, it makes it look so easy until you try to do it yourself, which is when you put on a little uncomfortable.
This woman has overcome all competition while still being the same Barbadian girl, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a harvest unless it is to perform at the OVO Fest. We love music that can change styles from one album to another. We love the videos that change your artistic vision from year to year. But above all, we love the woman who has not changed since the first day.
Oh man
Oh man oh man
No again
Yeah I learned the game from William Wesley you can never see me
With your back to the niggas who didn't get the message
On his back, like he's on the cover of Lethal Weapon
When I look back, I might be angry that I paid this attention.
Yes, but it weighs heavily on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left the boy with no options
I wanna see my niggas go crazy
You are going to make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You're gonna make me get out of my damn way
I waited four days, nigger, where are they?
I drove here in the Wraith playing AR-AB
I'm not sure what really pissed them all off
Second floor in Tootsies, rubbing shoulders
This for all of you who think I don't write enough
They are just mad because I have the Midas touch
You love her, then you have to give her the world
I know you must be a bully for her
This is not what he meant when he told you to open more
Yes it's turning you into a body singing a nigga
I'm not the type of black who will write to blacks
And I scream at all my boss bitches with niggas
Be sure to hit him with the prenup
So tell that man to relax
I made another, I made another
I got the drink on me going on my back
Yes going back
I got the drink on me going on my back
Yes, I have my back
I don't want to hear about this anymore
Not even when she tells him that they are best friends.
Not even when you say, "Drizzy, tell him again!"
I was in a program, it was an event with sold out tickets
Oh you need a better seat
He didn't want to, he gave me all the reasons
Given what you would do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please check whether there is a cable or earphone
Please don't let these niggas get close to me
Please think before you come for the great
Please, who is a real black and who is not?
Please someone stop me
I'm talking boasy and gwanin wassy
I got to the festival in five days and it's my shit
As soon as a nigger goes on stage, they go to '
They're going to ask if I can play this shit on my back
Yes they want it on their back
They're going to ask if I can play this shit on my back
I took a break from Views, now I'm back to that, nigga (Six)
Madam, you say I stay in the house until four
It's always the same huh
It's obvious baby
You see there's a lot to lose
Because we have a baby
And the people are cloudy
My generation is changing
Distributors have customers who provide crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from behind
Don't let it pass
I don't think they understood
He can come pick you up
If your parents in the hood
Not bad which means bad, but bad means well well well
Madam, someone shot the spot right next door
Where i work and i think they could
The next one will come for me
I'm telling you baby
I think i'm about to cry
I still have to go out tonight
Because i have to feed you
I hope to see you again ... again
Lately I don't know about the friends I date
I am nervous with my children, it depends on their anguish
It depends on if they keep all the tapas in pepsi
With dreams of seeing topless girls on jet skis
It depends on what they do to achieve that
'especially if they know where the girls live
Get the information, go with your money, this is how the world is
This is how niggas get dirty
The streets are seedy, I call them sesame
It is the city of Ernie and Bert
'especially when these young people are rejected for job opportunities
Next week the same place will burn
How can we be so aware of these problems and not move forward?
Many people only play a role when they spit
But I don't think they understood
I took the ivory trail and yes I'm glad Keenan could
Not bad means bad, but bad means good
Not bad which means bad, but bad means well well well
It's what everyone expected, right?
Your weekly entertainment
So you can get this beat and go to the head, claim it
Since we have Seinfeld in Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talk cards, I'll double it with poker
So it is obvious that you will have become stable with some jokers
And I'm shooting with some riders
Damn it, could you niggas get some runner?
I have my new girl so happy
Just save yourself the shame, don't even go near it
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
(ughh) and I was praying to drop June
But the representatives of the label press to make songs sound
So I keep it swinging for the sake of Pete
And if you don't speak well when you meet Drake
As soon as you hear it, you'll quote it
But trust me, I'm aware, and my cars are there
Is this interior big enough for your hidden motifs?
Because if you like you should stay with me
Alotta ice, alotta cream as Dickey Dee
I could hack the phone and disappear like Mishy Me
But I will try to have you on the journey with me
Slipped threw a Henri Bendel like it was slippery
And your ex-man is officially an enemy
Probably because he knows that I am exactly what you want me to be
Yes that's the reason you're looking
Because I've already snatched Ahoy fries from the cookie jar
He's only mad that his girl is in the house
A couple of subliminal lines caught me in the mix
But at this point I'm just pushing a body with a stick
Rap today is a childhood hobby
And the girls keep telling me that I'm still so smug
It's not a song that your ass will skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for this zipper
The way your girlfriend pumped me in the car
It seems like she really doesn't need gas for the trip
Millionaire shadows fade with the waves
I smile at a nigga if he still rocks braids
That just lets me know that we're not on the same page.
And that extends to all blacks except Trey
I'm out of here baby
They asked me about the last years and how it puts me in phase.
I wouldn't get it back, no, no if I get paid
Mr. Betcha, that is expensive because it is not a fleeting
Shit is so nasty, how tasty is it?
And you can probably find it coming out of a Macy's
Come out with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that hit and put that shit in a choke
Life of a Don, the lights keep on shining
Come to the club with that cool shit
And something crazy on my arm, eh-ahem
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds
Here we have the Gooo
I left the cars in the house
Things come and go, it's the rhyme now
I see it clearer, the season is closer
And still I must change, I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the majority but I'm still talking
He will emerge the victim, my words are images
And yes, the colors so strong that you heard my writing
Give me the right brush and I draw everything
I promise I've been thinking before
I hardly get tired, I rarely feel inspired
And you do it in a week is what I need every day
I'm meeting quotas while you rappers have hours of sleep
Spending nights in the studio tries to be Hova
Be on the throne instead of being yours
But look
Young Check your freestyle
I'm fast approaching the weekend
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10
Freestyle shit about to segway to verse here we go
It's like I'm making moves in my city
My ex girls want to be in the video
However, the ex-girls are trying to get on with me
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And if I know it well
And my effort is useless
I'm from the place where they release records and nobody sells
Nigga is the same
All day
But that's the face of the screw
Rappers will make you friends at first, but they really got into a fight
Waiting for you to stumble and slide on your own shoelace
That's why I got them into not fucking again
Play me
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh
And I use each and every one
They tell me to take a breath and Drake everything will come
Dog ... it's always been the same
It's all love
How not to score in a tennis game
For Dennis James's son
Owner of the city center on a Friday
Streets behind me as if taking a photo on a driveway
I roll up strips and whips with a hose that when turtles grow
They will close richmond
No change down
Those who hate will say that I am adequate
I think I got the flow type to make an addict quit
Seamless transition I'm the new new prince who gets pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Early morning, I'm tossing a coin in more
I'm changing the game, you see me exchanging a joint
They put out fire, bring buyers and try to chain us all
Because they buy from us
They benefit from the event.
We are delivering flyers
We benefit from the attempt to deliver wishes
But rich is how we're all finishing
So if you sell charter Jetts, call Brende
Yes look
You know how paigon's chat goes
I like R and V and O
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
We saw the man last night, they froze
There were no cameras, it was not a pose
The good thing is that the man was not taking out phones
The man begins to hide and make reposts
They do anything except highway
I still can't see them after it snows
Personality if I'm getting closer
Loyal to O because I have sworn an oath
Versace hotel and I'm taking the robes
Seen in person, I'm seeing a ghost
They told me to relax because they are taking control
I want to be free and I want to let you go
We came and you showed us more
I know so much shit I can't expose
I have all the tea and I'm heating it up
I need a shadow mansion, one room is not enough
You're throwing some shit but that shit was a failure
They have no direction, they follow us
I come from a city that never touch
Your man is a fool and he could be brushed
I can't name a rapper or a girl I trust
I dream of turning these jute into powder
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yes
You know how paigon's chat goes
I like R and V and O
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
I've been with Roxx through ups and downs
We saw the man last night, they froze
Just like that once in Nobu
The good thing is that the man was not taking out phones
We also have ties in the West End
She came over and they killed her
Throwing six like the man had the flu
I got too big out of sight
Back to basics, I won't lose
They want to connect when they don't have melodies
I don't care about jeans and crepe
I just want to make these songs for the set
I just want to carry that and let it get wet
Bend anyone, dun that crash
It doesn't make sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad as a leader and shh
I can't make love because they get too attached
The phone broke and the whip scratched
I'll only take my knots in cash
They can never tie me, that's a fact
All that bark but we know it's a cat
I really don't like going tit by tat
I just come as tat-tat-tat
I just finished that there, that's it
Big man like Rashid, Joey, Tadas, yeah
Shoutout Giggs for configuring the ting
SN1, OVO
I've been with chubbs through ups and downs
We saw the man last night, they froze
There were no cameras, it was not a pose
Just like that once in 'Chella
Staying big six and six with problems
The man begins to hide and make reposts
They do anything except highway
I still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteful jokes
Personality if I'm getting closer
Loyal to O because I have sworn an oath
Versace hotel and I'm taking the robes
Seen in person, I'm seeing a ghost
They told me to relax because they are taking control
Take all that shit with P and his brother
I want to be free and I want to let you go
I know so much shit I can't expose
I keep it inside and laugh alone
They have no direction, they follow us
I come from a city that never touch
Your man is a fool and he could be rushed
I can't name a rapper or a girl I trust
I dream of turning these jute into powder
Yes Yes
Big Scorpion, out now
Yes look
You know how paigon's chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
I've been with Roxx through ups and downs
We saw the man last night, they froze
There were no cameras, it was not a pose
The good thing is that the man was not taking out phones
You think you know me? That is not true
We also have ties in the West End
She came over and they killed her
Throwing six like the man had the flu
I got too big out of sight
Back to basics, I won't lose
They want to connect when they don't have melodies
I don't give a damn about jeans and pancakes
Either going to Milan or going to the Met
I just want to make these songs for the set
I just want to carry that and let it get wet
I have so many things in hiding
Bend anyone, dun that crash
Big and bad as a leader and shh
I can't make love because they get too attached
I'll only take my knots in cash
I just finished that there, that's it
Drizzy Drake
Maddas, jheeze!
Everything is fine
The agreement was signed
And my division is fine
And these enemies hate
That everything is fine
Say that shit in person
I'm a damn genius damn it
I'm not the type to kill you
If you really can't bear it
I succeed in my pocket
But Belly told me to do
And don't listen to anyone who knows me
Why have you known me
It would mean that there is a new me
And if you think I changed in the least I could have been fooled
And tell my city that I'm two-three
Drug dealers live indirectly through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise, I don't even have a break
And these other niggas are barely mentioned
I bet with this pen you could get attention
I'm just getting cold in the cut, nigga what?
And I feel like
I get it, I get it, I get it until I'm done
Tell them rappers, I'm the man from the city that I run.
So you yell at me pimping, if you plan a visit
And they say you talk when you live it
I'm trying to tell you i do this
You don't want to go there friend
I'm trying to tell you i do this
You don't want to go there friend
I'm trying to tell you i do this
You don't want to go there friend
You don't want to go there friend
Here I go
Street report
Balling around here
We need three courts
Violence, you don't want to resort
When this money runs slower than Eyore
If your life is a movie, you are an extra
I'm so flying, I glide Clyde Drexler
Mr. Pressure, bitch, I'm fresher.
They must have heard that they will never catch up
Someone throw a signal at the receiver
I'm on the plate now
Fuck the next
I get it, I get it, I get it until I'm done
Tell them rappers, I'm the man from the city that I run.
So you yell at me pimping, if you plan a visit
And they say you talk when you live it
I'm trying to tell you i do this
You don't want to go there friend
I'm trying to tell you i do this
You don't want to go there friend
I'm trying to tell you i do this
You don't want to go there friend
I'm trying to tell you i do this
You don't want to go there friend
Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We would have been fine
In your ear once
Prolly was wasting my time
Because she heard it all
Because she heard it all
Girl, it could have changed your life
But she heard it all
Well i'll say it anyway shawty
I'm from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You don't have to be in love to fuck
Girl I'm just trying to say
I'm from the city, oh
Where money makes the difference
You know, many girls know
This one is for you
Baby you're my everything you're everything I always wanted
We could make it really big, bigger than ever.
You know everything, other hoes are never in it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend anything on it
Because she hugs me every time I hit her
When I'm right I promise we'll live it
And I say the same thing every time
You are the best fucked up (Ayy), you are the best fucked up (Ayy)
You're the best I've ever had (Ayy), the best I've ever had (Ayy)
The best I've ever had (Ayy), the best I've ever had
I say you are the fucked up
Put the key under the rug and you know I'll be there (yeah)
I'm hitting all the places you didn't even know were there
And you don't even have to ask twice
I always felt you were so used to fast life
Sweatpants, tied hair, relaxing without makeup
That's when you're the cutest
I hope you don't take it wrong
You don't even stumble when your friends say
You know I'm working, I'll be there as soon as I get home
And she is patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to rumors and what they mean.
And until the girls try it
I'm the only one I never get confused with because
Baby you're my everything you're everything I always wanted
We could make it really big, bigger than ever.
I want this forever, I swear I can spend anything on it
Because she hugs me every time I hit her
When I'm right I promise we'll live it
She made me beg for it until she gave up
And I say the same thing every time
I mean, you're the best fucked up (Ayy), you're the best fucked up (Ayy)
You are the best fucked up (Ayy), you are the best fucked up (Ayy)
You're the best I've ever had (Ayy), the best I've ever had (Ayy)
The best I've ever had (Ayy), the best I've ever had
I say you are the fucked up
Buzz so big he could probably sell a blank record
And blacks will buy it too and claim they bought it for their sister
Magazine paper, girl, money is not the problem
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to start
She calls me the referee because I'm so official
And who told you to put on your jeans?
Double cup of love, I lean on you
Yeah I just know my condo is the perfect place
In every show, she's repeating like a pet
Baby you're my everything you're everything I always wanted
You know everything, other hoes are never in it
Because she hugs me every time I hit her
When I'm right I promise we'll live it
I mean, you're the best fucked up (Ayy), you're the best fucked up (Ayy)
You are the best fucked up (Ayy), you are the best fucked up (Ayy)
You're the best I've ever had (Ayy), the best I've ever had (Ayy)
The best I've ever had (Ayy), the best I've ever had
I mean, you're the best fucked up (Ayy), you're the best fucked up (Ayy)
You are the best fucked up (Ayy), you are the best fucked up (Ayy)
You're the best I've ever had (Ayy), the best I've ever had (Ayy)
The best I've ever had (Ayy), the best I've ever had
Uhh, ah yes
See, this is the type of joint you should dedicate to someone
Just make sure it's someone special
Young money, yes, yes
Drop down, drop down
Drop down, drop-drop, take it, take it
Drop down, drop down
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear I get it, I get it, I get it

Your hustle never goes unnoticed baby, I'm with you, I'm with him
I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it
They don't work hard like you, damn, that's so crazy
At the end of the night, when you count, the numbers don't lie to my baby
Locker room full of money, girl, you just did it
I get it, I get it, man, fuck everything he talks about, shoot the kidney
Down payment on the Jaguar, your roommate got credit
12 months on the lease, that's a future baby, never forget it
Connections are heavy, every real nigger fuck you
Broken nails in diamonds, you shine but you fuck man
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
Tonight was your night, go get lobsters and shrimp
You're smart and you know it, I get it, I get it, you beat these pimps
I hope you don't fall, it's you on top of the roof
Never forget your story, I get it, you did it, you did it
They can't wait until it's all over
Shine on your hoes, let them know shit runs
281 to my city, I heard you had problems at customs
I get it, I get it, what happens at night?
Oooh, 305 to my city, I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it, I swear I get it, I get it, I get it
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it
Get it, get it, get it, dropdown, dropdown dropdown
Get it, get it, get it, dropdown, dropdown dropdown
You only go to LIV after church on Sunday
Oh lord, oh lord, we are no longer in Kansas
I am not what they are looking for I am not what they are looking for
I'm not really Atlanta, I'm not really Brooklyn or
I don't fit in with the appeal to them shows that they could reserve it for
Straight nigga tryin 'through a crooked door
Just fitting in because a trick for what they took
But hesitating made me change the route
To another destination where the people they are on!
Have you ever felt very above everything?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like I'm rich when I'm about to get the ball
And think once about the clothes I buy at the mall
I'm famous so I got close fast, Louie and Coach
All in coach class, gem like topaz, cool like slow jazz
Dope like coca lines and cracks like broken glass
I promise it's me, me
I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga who's rapping for money
Please do me a favor and keep it between you and me
You, you, you, you, you
Yes
Ok i'm floating in my zone without a scheduled descent
The rise and fall were never my intention
I want this shit printed forever on cement
And if I ever sin I promise to repent
I'm just trying to win, I'm not trying to present
You have to listen carefully as if it came through the vent
These rappers can't see me, I live behind the dye
The little me in row 23F real recognizes real, are none of you left?
Everyone in the game can't any of you ref.
And filter the shit, what the hell is it all about?
Now you're tuned to this summer's newcomer
Chris Pauls this fall exist yall - Yes
And is the realistic black still me?
A bitch could love you to death and you would still die
Ahhh!
I'm not supposed to do this
I'm supposed to be this nigga who's rapping for money
And you put all my songs together so you know this shit is wrong
Please do me a favor and keep it between you and me
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Just keep it between you and me
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
(Crowd clapping and applauding)
Yes
What about you guys
I want to thank you all for coming tonight
You know we're about to rock tonight
So if you clap your hands with me
I'm about to tell you a secret, as long as you can keep it
Between you and me
Aww man
Ho! Yes!
Hahaha
Yes ... Can you hear me out there?
It's a lovely night tonight, isn't it?
Yes I know
I know what they think, they have not heard the rhythm that they already scared
But look, I'm just gonna keep it real
I would like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yes
(There must be something wrong with you baby)
Half of this shit before I woke up
(Ohh yes)
That's causing me this drama
When you come to town
And I know that if I see you guaranteed that it will fall
Why
Too much to stay with this girl (Ho!)
I respect a woman
This bitch is crazy (yeah)
This bitch is crazy
I respect a woman (I do)
She doesn't even know
That's the craziest part, right?
She just oblivious to all the shit like
I want to use the wife beaters
With the slit at the top
I wanna sing in the rain girl
You know what I'm talking about
I need an R&B name too like uh ... like uh ... like
I do not know I'll think about it
Hears!
Hahaha
You are really crazy
Ho!
Oh well nigga back off ho!
Dammit
I said it without saying it man
I know that everyone enjoys the circus, but I want to clarify this image in question. This was not from a clothing brand shoot for my music career. This image is from 2007, a time in my life when I was an actor and working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, be stereotyped, and get elected. The photos depicted how African Americans were wrongly portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best friend at the time, Mazin Elsadig, who is also an actor from Sudan, tried to use our voices to raise awareness of the issues we deal with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and increase our frustrations at not always having a fair chance in the industry, and to point out that the fight for black actors had not changed much.
This Virginia is over with me
I'm a real damn, could I say how I feel
Don't turn me on, I have big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no sprinklers
I want to know, how come we can never cut back and still be friends?
I'm real for real, I could tell how I feel
Because i know what i like
I know how I want to live my life
I don't need any advice
You're not here and we both know why
So move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I'm building a house where I was raised
Don't turn me on, I have big plans
We need to forward to the islands
And get you gold, no sprinklers
I need you to stop running back to your ex, he's a waste
I'm a real damn, could I say how I feel
I know we can't keep it together forever
Because sometimes you are crazy
And I only see you sometimes
Move from me when you're extra
Move from me with the passa
I'm building a house where I was raised
You move with me, I'll go, look alone
Don't turn me on, I have big plans
We need to forward to the islands
I need you to stop running back to your ex, he's a waste
I want to know, how come we can never cut back and still be friends?
I'm a real damn, could I say how I feel
I'm a real damn, could I say how I feel
Together forever
Good morning Good afternoon Good night!
I'm here to talk about more life
One second
Rebel, unruly, maddas
Unquestionably we have already finished you
Sounds really dead, could you tell how I feel
Yeah he seems really dead, could you tell how I feel
I heard that Tinie Tempah dem are big fans
I heard there's a funeral today, you need to make plans
Mario
Pluto
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Look who I'm fucking with again
I saw the ice thin
Now, does it sink or nothing?
She had an attitude in the summer
But she's being nice again (she's being nice)
Double my price again (Double my price)
Up the charts, back in their hearts
Nigga, attack again, whoa
Some blacks embittered with life and hate me
They wanna put a knife to my ribs, whoa
The way this shit was established, I live like Ronaldo
But I was never in Madrid, whoa
She said she was working, I told her to come
And we can go straight to the crib, whoa
She finishes at 6 but then says she came to court in the morning to fight for her son.
I said I would pray for the boy
What time is it (whoa)
Be alive for this shit (yeah)
The president makes us (Woo)
My window turned blue in tint (Skrrt)
I did this shit once and I would do it again
I had it on ice but then
I saw the ice thin
Now, does it sink or nothing?
(Blue faces)
I have blue diamonds, blue tint, yeah
(Blue faces)
I have blue diamonds, blue tint, yeah
God
Ayy, ayy
Look who I'm stuck with again
I had it on ice but then
Ayy, because she's being nice again (She's being nice)
Double my price again (Double my price)
Up the charts, back in their hearts
Nigga, attack again, whoa
Some blacks embittered with life and hate me
They wanna put a knife to my ribs, whoa
No one better to show up and run it
And I could put that on the cufflinks, whoa
We are not together but I have the information about you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah they shouldn't have told me but they did
What time is it (whoa)
Be alive for this shit (yeah)
The president makes us (Woo)
Ayy, I did this shit once and I would do it again
Look who I'm fucking with again
I had it on ice but then
I saw the ice thin
Now, does it sink or nothing?
I have blue diamonds, blue tint, yeah (come on)
(Blue faces)
I have blue diamonds, blue tint, yeah (come on)
I know you know I'm too deep to let it go
I know a year has passed since I left you alone
(But you never say shit)
(I don't know how to take it)
We are good alone
But I miss being home with your house and
I drink you under the tables (I drink you under the tables)
I misbehaved you (I misbehaved you)
Buzzing your body
Body to body
You said you have surpassed me
Now you're on me
Body to body
You said you have surpassed me
Now you're on me
You lock me up and then you hit me
Like, "Pick me up"
I hit you back like, "Send me something
Show me something"
I haven't seen you in a year or something
so what's up
You know how I'm going
I'm lifting your body
I have to call you first as shotty
Bussin 'your - bussin' your body up
Buzzing your body
Now you're on me
Buzzing your body
Body to body
Now you're on me
uh uh uh
I got my emotions on open mic and shit
Fancy all this pink champagne on ice and shit
From a glass, girl, I can see how nice you are
You said you got over me, now you got over me
Buzzing your body, melee
I know, you know, I'm too deep to let it go
I know a year has passed since I left you alone
But you never say shit, I don't know how to take it
We are good on our own, but
I miss being in Wiltshire at your house, and
I drink you under the tables, I have bad behavior
You said you got over me, now you got over me
Buzzing in your body, melee
Who else really tries to mess with Hollywood Cole?
Treat Birmingham like my Hollywood shows
This flow of Bollywood millionaire millionaire slumdog
Fake friends write the wrong answers in the mirror for me
I'm not confused
I am not with different crews
We live in the same building, but we have different points of view.
I have a couple of cars, I never lose
I don't like my single women, I like my girls two by two
And these days all the girls are ready to roll
We got to the strip club, and all of them girls found a pole
Tell your girl to tell her friend it's time to go
Tell me the weather today
I know they say they're okay, but trust me, I'm better
I'm cold but I'm still hot, you can't pick a sweater
Really this is whatever it is and i'm murdering and this is so much fun
If there is something to see I am an illusion
I'm telling you I'm the baby man, what's the confusion?
And if they still sleep on me, someone postponed
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million
I'm headed for the moon, I'm not gonna hit the ceiling
But fuck what they say, let me tell you how I feel
I'm drinking, these London streetlights have a real glow
Drizzy playing fast but feels slow
And ask your man he's a hateful baby he doesn't know
This here was meant to be buried
I have many things, I hardly mention them
I am not lying to children, as the dentist is not scary
Pulling McClarens through a McDonald's lane road
I'm too fast, keep it hip-hop like Afu Ra
Girl in that McClaren, you have to lift the doors
This here is in truth
It seems that everything I do, you're used to
And I hate hearing stories about who you've been with
So you still think I have confidence, and damn
Is this going to last?
You are on a pedestal, are we moving too fast?
I feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
So I have to ask
Is there something I'm doing new?
New (new), new (new), new
Is there something I'm doing new?
(Is there something I'm doing new?)
Oh girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
This is personal.
I very much doubt that this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that's why it hurts to know
That you try to hide and put aside the mistakes
So I never question you, and damn it
I can't even find the perfect brush
Then I can paint what goes through my mind
New (new), new (new), new
(Is there something I'm doing new?)
Is there something I'm doing new?
New, new, new, new, new
Late, late, late, late
Did he take your clothes off like that?
Did he give you love just like that?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the first date?
Tell me baby, am I too late?
Is there something I'm doing new?
New (new), new (new), new
Show me if this is new (new)
(Is there something I'm doing new?)
But I'm not sure what else you were expecting
When the superiors have united as a collective
With conspiracies to end my career and send me a message
40, did you get the message?
Because I just checked my phone and I didn't understand it
I mean, I take off my hat by solid effort
But we didn't flinch for a second, we put our shit together
Yes not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk about high scores
FIESTA has just been immersed in a white Porsche
And I just got home from dinner, where I ate some well-made scallops that were dying for
But I have bigger fish to fry
I'm talking shit bigger than you and me
Children are losing lives, I was afraid of losing mine
I wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flying over Chattanooga
Out here trying to spread the movement
I just bought the Mercedes Pullman
Back in town, the shit is getting brutal
These kids will hit your noodles and then take a girl to the movies
We're not in it, we just have a ghost ride
The pen works if you niggas need some phantom lines
I guess you only make moves on your own time
But I just know it will be January in no time
And your absence is very worrying
It's like you go on vacation without a return plan
The banners are ready in case we need to remove your shirt
I have a club in the Raptors arena
Championships, celebrations during the regular seasons
Paternity test for women I never slept with
I am legally bound if requested
As much legal action as Michael Jackson
Ahh nigga, that shit has to go platinum
I just heard Closer to My Dreams
I can't rap like that, all young and naive
Not after all the shit I've seen and the things I believe in
I'm in a different space and I choose to hug him
4,000 square feet just aren't that spacious
You loved me in the basement
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and crooked niggas shapes
Tired of champagne toast with people looking away
Peyton and Eli when the niggas called me brother
I see you finish with nothing
You guys throw the word "family" over for discussion
Rookie season, I never thought this would come
Their knees buckle and they pass you suddenly
Now you're the one with the cubes
They surround you with their arm
And the women you've seen on TV look better in person
They care to see where it goes from there
But these are not the Brampton girls
This is not that local action
Those who hate only bring me and my people closer, actually
You niggas said it was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to
Ignore the fact that it never happened?
Are we supposed to get the cake and then divide it in two?
Are you supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about yourself?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money as secrets, save that shit for us
Daddy shampoo, young pablito of six god
6 G-O-D, I think I was meant for this shit
When I was around Keyshia Cole and T.I
And Young Dro was dating "Ain't I"
Long before niggas had their hands
As if they were making macarena
But who am I to complain now? I'm still close, they know
This here is in truth
It seems that everything I make him use
And I hate hearing stories about who you've been with!
That's when I have to hide what I feel inside
So you still think I'm safe and doomed
Is this going to last?
You're on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
(chorus)
New, new, new, new
Is there something new I'm doing?
New, new, new, new, new
(Aye Aye Aye)
Knowledge is pain and that's why it hurts to know
So I never question you and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
Then I can paint what goes through my mind
Running against myself, but I'm a couple of steps behind
That is why I must ask, is there something new I am doing?
(chorus)
New, new, new, new
Is there something new I'm doing?
New girl, new, new, new, new
(Aye Aye Aye)
(Little Wayne)
This here in some shit remix
It seems that everything I do is filtered
And I hate hearing stories of who I'm sleeping with
I swear I have to hide what I have on my journey
So she still thinks I'm confident and damn
My life is on the pedestal, am I moving too fast?
I feel like I'm in crazy competition with my past
So I have to ask
Am I doing something new?
(chorus)
Is there something new I'm doing?
(Little Wayne)
Don't blame me if any man knew if he knew better (um huh) and no longer did it for him.
But I know you heard this song before ...
(Duck)
It's all I'm doing too late (6x)
Did he take your clothes off like that?
Did he give you love like that?
On the first date
Tell me baby, am I too late?
(chorus with Drake)
Am I doing something new?
New new
Show me if this is new, new
(Little Wayne)
And this is the baby remix, baby weezy, drizzy, yung mula baby
Even if you are alone
Completely only when I'm gone
I just want to keep you warm
Come back come back
Yes, I will be there, yes, yes, I will be there
Because when I'm alone I think of your face
All I want to do is give myself everything now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yes
Don't get lost, fly with me, fly with me
Don't miss, fly with me
(Check it out, take a look)
Don't get lost, fly with me, fly with me
I am aware that we have just met
I don't want to leave you yet
Come back come back
Yes, I will be there, oh, yes, I will be there, oh
About to board a flight, sitting at my door
I just want to touch you but I'm so far away (I'm so far away)
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh
Don't miss, fly with me
Don't get lost, fly with me, fly with me
(Check it out, take a look)
* Fragment letters *
... the offer you gave me was absurd
Daddy, this bird won't fly, you sold me an ostrich
I'm not playing my nigga go and laugh
But the bullets don't tickle
If you think you're playing with Elmo, hell no
If you were in a pine box (box)
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right up and fall asleep (fall asleep)
If you were in a pine box (box)
I would surely break the lock
I would jump and fall asleep (fall asleep)
'Cau-'cau-' because you are the death of me
Because you are, the death of me, you, you, the death of me
Looking at myself in the mirror, I'm ashamed
I feel like a suicide bomber
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the business of fighting hands on man's arm, they treated me
When I said that the music business was all I needed
That said last year she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz.
Bright lights and Rihanna as a friend
My vice is similar, women love when you're my type
And you win everything that your palm writes
Put it in the Palms Hotel, city of sin
Because the audience one day said it would
So instead of a verse that reads
I'm going to go and get some of the strength of my music
And your fabric looks good with Indian footprints
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don't call back, just blame your Canadian
Stick to my cell phone I thought he was going to sell me
A false word like the rappers I know
A white waitress waiting when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 Jeep lifted
Without doors, all that missing nigga was Aaliyah
I felt like initiation, a reality that lives in the womb
And how women are the ones who taste the shit we do
Then he said he was the same age as ... myself
And it didn't help because it made me even more rude and impatient
The reason why I'm breathing all the vanity I know
The reason the highlight was when he said:
You belong to people when you're out
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
The word on the road is the clique about to explode
You don't have to run and tell anyone they already know
We've been living high, been talking low
But it's great, I know you've heard it all before
So I asked you how do you mean how do you mean
I thought you knew about the team, (ay)
So I asked you how do you mean how do you mean
I thought you knew about the team, (ay)
How do you mean, how do you mean, what do you know about the team
Man these niggas need to stop him, they're filling the scene
Baby you gotta stop it, all that pride and self-esteem
You got mad about this girl I'm with in all those magazines
Baby she looks like a star, but only on camera
It seems that we are in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
You know I could be your knight in shining armor All tires
Trying to tell you it's me, come and yell at me
Before being in the next ting, YMCMB (ah)
Ooh I finally have you here
Tonight I will ease your mind
That's why I call you
And ooh soft your love wants
It's hard to stay away
You keep calling me
I thought you knew about the team, (ay)
So I asked you how do you mean how do you mean
I thought you knew about the team, (ay)
How do you mean, how do you mean, what do you know about the team
You only know what they tell you girl, I see behind the scenes
He spilled whiskey on his shirt, he will have to clean it
She's been going too hard, someone has to step in
Only on camera, only on camera
It may seem like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they're all lies
You know it could be your knight in shiny armor with all the tires
Girl they love me like I'm a prince like the new king with the crown
Lots of underground kings, I thought you knew how we got down (ah)
Ooh I finally have you here
Tonight I will ease your mind
That's why I call you
And ooh soft your love wants
It's hard to stay away
You keep calling me
How do you mean, how do you mean, I thought you knew about the team (ay)
How do you mean, how do you mean, I thought you knew about the team (ay)
Just send me my ring back, I can't keep that shit.
Can i baby Can i baby
Yes can i baby Can i baby
Can I take you to six where I'm really staying, baby?
Show why I am the way I am
I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I have an honest moment with you now, baby?
Tell me who the fuck do you want to be
Because what we always talk about is me
May l? Before turning off the lights
Can I call you instead of sending you a text message to the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wants to hear your voice
Can I see you now, I know the sun is rising, baby?
Sorry i really have no choice
Can I make you feel like I'm depressed about you, baby?
Can I finally take the time and open up to you, baby?
May l? Before I turn off the lights one more time
Can i baby May l? Before turning off the lights
Can i baby Can i baby
Can i baby Can i baby
May l? Before turning off the lights
Tell me who the fuck do you want to be
Can i baby Can i baby
May l? Before I turn off the lights one more time
Tell me who the fuck do you want to be
Before turning off the lights
How could I fly but lose everything?
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you walk away, maybe you walk away
As my older brother says, I will enter
Olimpic loser money, I'm glad I learned to swim
CAnnonball, bitch, I hope to dive until I'm 30
And these enemies hate
Gave many women who first ride the ghost
And yes, now I have a deal and I'm sure
And yet my life is so exciting that I get bored
I am the best of my peers, and everyone prays because I am running out of ideas
Beyond my MO, because I shine so bright
Critics have a hard time pinpointing flaws
All this witty talk, I just hope I don't fall
Straight from the sky, through the roof of your garage
How could I fly but lose everything?
I'm a cannonball
Maybe you walk away, maybe you walk away
Prepare me and let me out
Man, fresh out of the sand, February tan
It's a joke, but you say you're real, I don't understand
We evolved, we used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, yell at Buffalo, never duck
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on the road, I always hug the road
Fuck an opp, roll his body, yeah, a lot of those
Started doing college shows, Calipari flow
Then I appeared as if you had never seen
I love so much, I can't have it all, I can't have it all
I want a lot, I can't have everything but I want everything
Bad attitude, tell who to calm down?
Try to calm everything down, who's calling my name?
Who is involved now? Tell me who do I have to go down
I'll make a song now, man
Although there is much less to show everyone now, man
Everything that happened is coming back
They better touch the ground
Damn, forever unfinished beef
Yes, everything is open, it had me out for a minute
Have you had them since you started?
Damn I must be training because I'm not playing with them
Can't you see the difference?
I mean, I keep the fucking lights on in the building
I can't have it all, I can't have it all
I want a lot, I can't have everything but I want everything
I finally got my mind in a free state
Niggas tried to serve me a cheese steak
I gave them back a clean plate
The same niggas preein because they hate seeing the team directly
That's when the phone starts ringing like "Are we straight?"
Two-faced niggas come back with all three faces
Face I never knew the plug, but I rap about the plug
You are all fucking fun
They really think all of you niggas come together to scare us
You all niggas are arrogant, you all sleep at the Sheraton
He doesn't even die and I ball with his inheritance
All that Drake hysteria
6 side, east side, all that for my area
You know, honey, I'm a little worried about this negative tone I hear in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty comes from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disappointed you are as well as being skeptical about who you think you can trust. But that attitude will simply stop you in this life, and you will continue to feel alienated. Think about this a little, because I have confidence in you, and I know that you can reach your desired destination and achieve your goals much more quickly without this confrontation that I hear in your tone these days. When others come down, we go up.
Uh yeah man uh
I feel really good now
I'm not even gone yet, not even
I took a leave of absence but I feel like I'm back
yes man
Check, I roll with the coalition, when no one heard
I spoke now, niggas is throwing this
You gassed, my low emission vehicle
I can enter your excursion without permission
Slip, I've done it before, I told you to run it before
Now the city is mine, and what you thought it would be
Isn't he a rapper working harder than me? I put my heart in T
Uh,?, Carries the city on my back like a Jansport
Homie, you make a lot of music, niggas don't feel
You rappers shouldn't rap, rappers should paint roofs
That is why I am not competitive, because deep down I know that I am much better than all of you.
Watchu means if I really flow, I want to know if I really flow just ask V-O
I'm trying to make my cousin ashley's doll shine until someone wakes her up and it really snows
We keep it on and poppin 'like the dance scene in Thriller
This is the new version fresh prince and andreana miller
And d-10tion el boi-1da
And people focused on keeping the boy low
Probably because I don't act like you
And I don't have to sell crack like you
Well, not really, I mean that I move the disk-shaped crack
But that's just because I don't rap like you
And now it's happening to them
He is beginning to be my friend, it is reassuring for them.
Either that or every verse I mean them
So catch me in a zone until I'm left alone
Uh, and that's exactly what it is
Do you feel Me
Benard I see you friend
I see you
Rescue, brandon I see you
Yes JD Era I see you
Mayhem maury er see you
Yes that's the coalition
D-10tion boi-1da the commitment
Andreana I see you baby
Stockings yes, row
You know
Uh, we keep it running, there's no way to stop it
Yes, you have an inflow, you have to stay for the whole century.
This is how I holla me
And that is
Ayo, blow that shit up, Maxx
Ayy
UberX to Hidden Hills
Give me something i can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills
So I know they know the deal
We are right up there on the road
I'm here alone
I'm just trying to set the tone
They kicked me when I was down
None of that shit matters now
Niggas think they run the city
Until we get them out of town
I have to dive in where they stay
Everything will be fine
Man just stay out of my way
The skid ends with the brothers and I am equipped to the feet
If I play the studio then we have one
I will try to laugh with the brothers about the opps we know
But they can't take a joke, because it's not a
I think it's because we live by the code, reputation to maintain
Making me the one who have to take the place of
Ayo, blow that shit up, Maxx
Back and forth to Italy
My comments section is killing me
I swear I'm passionate
You don't know half
I grew up with the guys from Reps Up, we crashed and splashed
And when I say they crash, I don't mean an accident
I'm ... I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my enemies either on the way to work or came
And I have to own the things I rap about just because of my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't let go of that shit
They kicked me when I was down
None of that shit matters now
They'll be throwing in the towel
I make yellow tail in TAO
Especially when it's on my face
Everything will be fine
Man just stay out of my way
If I play the studio then we have one
I will try to laugh with the brothers about the opps we know
But they can't take a joke, because it's not a
I think it's because we live by the code, reputation to maintain
Making me the one who have to take the place of
I'm running but I can't escape
You say you changed
But you never change
44, 22
But you're just like I knew
44, 22
Just make the call, 22
But you're just like I knew
44, 22
You build it to break it in half
But you're just like I knew
Just make the call, 22
But you're just like I knew
44, 22
Just make the call, 22
But you're just like I knew
I know I fear trust
I know I'm too afraid of fear
On my plate, looking up
Outer space, pearly doors
I'm running but I can't escape
You say you changed
All night long I've been watching, can you say I love you?
It can't be too open, there's nothing, I won't
Oh I just thought you should know
That's when you start laughing
Saying I only want what I can't have
Claiming that I'm not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew this is serious
I wish i wasn't famous
I wish I was still in school
To be able to have you in my bedroom
It would make you crazy
That's when you start laughing
Saying I only want what I can't have
Won't even give me a chance
Claiming that I'm not as serious as you
Shorty if you only knew this is serious
I wake up all night
I wake up all night
I wake up all night
I wake up all night
I wake up all night
I wake up all night
Stop stop Stop…
Fuck niggas gonna be fuck niggas
That's why we never give a shit when a fucking nigga got changed
So sorry
Did you expect me to be crying?
It was hard without you
It was hard without you
Today I did some charity for the children
But I'm used to it because all the charity cases
They all look me in the face hoping they can be the replacement
Niggas is sniffing at us without questioning
I am silent because we are at war and I am very patient
I'm loaded, I'm loaded
Wow, I am honored that you think this is organized
I'm flattered, man, actually I'm amazed
The perfect start to summer, man, this shit is a mess
This shit is a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You guys are coming into your feelings about me
You should accept it, this could be one of our most real moments
Okay, the flow starts to feel familiar, right?
Should I remind you that Jimmy made $ 20 million?
I need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on him
None of them want this shit more than I want it.
I saw it coming, I knew they'd push a button
East Egg Huntin ', gotta find something
Done by doing favors for people
Because it's not that I need the money I earn from a function
I see you niggas having trouble getting gold
Becoming something like that and so nobody knows
But it goes on like this
Come live all your dreams at OVO
We will make sure you get your bread and know the ropes
I get a ring and take it home like it's Cory Joe
No woman had hit my star
I'm loaded
Oh no we're eating niggas ain't about to starve us
No, the blacks are not about to starve us
I bought my niggas rolls on Thank Me Later
While these boys were moody leggin '
Trust me, this information is vital
I'm trying to take the high road
I still have love for my idols
I have a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
It is rumored that there is something only I know
It is rumored that I drive the ship with my eyes closed
It is rumored that I took it or never could
But it's rumored it ain't done you no good, niggas
It's sound, sound, sound until the day of my death
And your main focus is trying to harm us?
And you think you're about to starve us?
Niggas ain't about to starve us
Nah, I'm loaded!
You've seen me?
I do very well
Every time we meet:
"Oh I'm very sorry".
That's why we never give a shit when a fucking nigger got online)
"You know, I kept it real
And then when you stay real with people, they cross the line, they take your kindness for weakness and that's weak. "
Two-thirty, honey, won't you see me at The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
Windy city, she blows me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you on the show tonight?
Will I see you on the show tonight?
Ayy, truck to the plane, to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby.
Presidential suite, in deposit
Elevator to the room.
Showering and then we hit the club
Touchdown, I have to see what happens
Area code on my phone
Who do I know from the past?
Give it to one, she says she has a man
Hit another, turn green
You must have changed the phones on the computer
That was 2017
All right, Chubbs will look around
Find one that looks like my type
That he and my father know what I like
He found me a lot in my life
Galleria credit cards
I don't even know if she's a wife
But if one thing
Women come and go
Saturday to Sunday Monday
From Mondays to Sundays
Maybe someday we will grow
Until then I'll sit my drunk ass on that track
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is, every time I visit
Windy city, she blows me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you on the show tonight?
Jewels in the safe on arrival
J-gun to survive
Lots of people fighting for the title
Although I just want to have a good night
The waiter brought the check for the food
She said, "Baby, I think there was a typo."
Nah girl, I got it, that's light
I could show you bigger things than that
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had many women in the past
I did a lot of sinning in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stuck on your backstage pass
All access because you're bad
You could go anywhere with that ass
Show, shower, truck
Truck, to the club, for the party.
Cause I don't know who's out there looking
But if one thing
Saturday to Sunday Monday
Maybe someday we will grow
'Till then I'll sit my drunk ass on that track
On this way
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
Thirty degrees, too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you on the show tonight?
Will I see you on the show tonight?

Why do you have to fight me at Cheesecake?
You know i love going there
This is a place for families who drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know everything about our business.
You are wild, super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it.
Therefore, you cannot drive it and accumulate miles
Mom is a saint, yes she raised me very well
Don't make me put you back in the hood
Don't make me give you back
I say bounce that shit like woah

She rode him like a soldier
She rode him like a jungle soldier
She rode it like a yes, yes
I have it, yes
You don't want to fall in love, I know
I'm not someone you should trust, I know
I give Chanel a hug, I know
How many girls have slept in this bed?
I gave a different number than the one in my head
Lying to protect you, I will do a lot
My checkered past like the Louis you just received
Married in our twenties, now where's the fun in that?
My city loves me like a university runner
Pack a bag, you'll end up staying where I am
I took you off the hood and I could never give you back
I just want to let you know that someone loves you back
The whole Cadillac like it's Teddy Pendergrass
Spanking this shit, I'm getting ready, where are you?
Riding ...
She rode that dick like a soldier
She rode him like a soldier
She rode him like a Melpomene soldier
She rode that dick like a soldier

He circled that dick like a soldier
She rode him like a soldier

Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Burrrrat stick it, ba-ba-ba stick it
Thanks, thanks Drake, thanks baby
Drunk and tired motherfuckers
Tired I'm tired boss
This is the record that my underground fans can jump
On the way back, fans from the south of the city turn
Chasing fat accumulations, running through big grands and submission
I don't go back, every sound for me is different
I don't have ice, I just have clean rap
Never take two steps, I just move, I bend, I break
We could take him to Houston, where all the rides were overlooked
Someone I'm standing in command of
Thief minds say I'm serving them rhymes
And me and Nickel F go together as burgers and diners, yeah
I'm like a waiter and you're something like an enemy
With the trays in both hands, place an order that I can serve, uh
I have diamonds in my teeth flow
Peep, I just feel sorry for you lame
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city I claim
I have diamonds in my teeth flow
Memphis is the reason my rhyme and speech are slow
Peep, however, when I get tired, it speeds up
Riding through the streets, leaning on my hoe seat
Uh, the city lights look brighter, it's 3 a.m. in the morning and the pen is like a lighter
I already said it, I give you the lead-free, just give me a tip, if your tank is empty, come find me
Me, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
D-R-A-K-E that's me
You know how the story goes
Get up, Range Rove, girl, I wanna roll
And I play on the stereo
And I make them want
Bounce, bounce, wop, wop,
Girl, move like you're getting money for college, go away!
Shake, shake, drop, drop
Bounce, bounce, wop, wop,
Girl, move like you're getting money for college, go away!
Break it down like you work for your tuition at Howard
Mom, understand how you live, what you work for is power
Try to be generous, so honey, here's a tip
Nowadays it's getting cheaper to put 20 in the whip
So if you're an opportunist, find 20 in the clip
And if you find them attractive and fun, it's when you dive, you dive
And it's a journey, my city was divided into sections
To the north they gave me a couple of problems, a couple of connections
And it is nothing I have purposely created.
There are people who have problems
But they were afraid to let it out, uh
Now boy, say this, that and the third for them
Look at me and they never say a word to you
Hope he doesn't draw a card from the deck
I respect anyone in my city, but I respect him
You have a debt and you decide not to pay that
I'm going to jump over your fence, go into your yard and pick up, give him a lecture
Not a problem of concern bruh
I always end up exactly what I win bruh
So hand over your receipt if you try to make a bruh return
Yes sir, I live in a city where many people don't shine, shine
And, I'll be near the fence as soon as someone gets off the line, line
And I received too much love, for the city I can never have too much of
And if someone hates me, I deport them, the city is mine
Me, the city is mine (which one?)
T-O-R-O-N-T-O
Get up, Range Rove, girl, I wanna roll
And I play on the stereo
And I make them want
Shake, shake, drop, drop
Girl, move like you're getting money for college, go away!
Shake, shake, drop, drop
Bounce, bounce, wop, wop,
Girl, move like you're getting money for college, go away!
After that, break it down
After that, break it down
Break it, break it
Break it, break it
After that, break it down
Break it, break it
Yeah i remember and D and I used to talk about this kind of thing all the time
I didn't know much then, but I'll probably tell you a little now
Get bored quickly
It keeps growing
Ex strippin 'girl
I can't stop her
Because I need something to balance the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you're talented and black
When you yell at the labels
And they silence you back
Why don't you thoroughly discuss some violence on your way
Good
Shot for the young yacht owner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it, I love it here, I call it my birthplace
Surrounded by Filipinos, I think of the worst case scenario.
Look blue and green diamonds, I call it the face of the Earth
I'm making cake for you, I tell you how you know dessert
You eat pedigree like your food
I have been Urkel for some years, it is better to be Jaleel
Although I rock lean, it's better to be that real
Better to drive a car with the letter B on the steering wheel
Back seat
Light saying tank in E
I drank
To be the only black you won't see
At the club with a model spilling drinks on me
Not
Give me 20 in the tank on 3
I'm on the range crashing Keyshia Cole
Singing out of tune like [Andreena harmonizes]
I am free from you
I know because I am there.
It hasn't even started, I'm really trying to prepare them
Spring '07 second quarter I'm falling
With or without tag, I'm committed to explode
And take the summer
Hoppin 'tour
I will meet many women, I will do many shopping
There really is no other option
Spend a lot of money just to get it back
Anyone who has heard a song, I do not remove
The same rappers that are on your face saying that Drake is crazy
They're checking my availability just to make a hint
I promise mom
I'm going to do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through baby)
And I just want you to sit with your friends at a table
And say "My baby is famous and I knew it" (yeah)
So all the joints come out classic
Rappers are fake, we can all point to one
Yes
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF (uhh)
Miss Andreena Mill
Yes i feel it while i sleep
I said that I'm getting taller
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it seems like I'll never go ahead
Closer to my dreams
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
From meeting Trey in Atlanta to making a cameo on his video
What did everything right with X (Songz)
I have too many records and there are not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough ___
Good
You can fill in the blank
They try to be the best
I'm just trying to put it on the rankin '
Abandon pen nursery service
To grade ten dropout

Times have changed now I'm older mom
And these niggas ain't solid, they fold in drama
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never notice

How are you doing the album?
I'm taking the cake off my last one "
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city I tour
Dinner time
I bet I'm the black of my city when I arrive
Home
Yeah one more time before we turn off the lights ladies and gentlemen
(Sing to Dreena) lights about to come down, curtains about to close but
I want you to have fun when you go out yeah man
(Yes man)
Yes
I remember myself and D and I used to talk about this kind of thing all the time like
How will it be when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then, but
Mr. Big Dreams without tolerance
I cut you in the house and I haven't screamed since
Get bored quickly
So the p-a-tron had to be dumped quickly
Ex naked girl, I can't stop her
Because I need something to balance the fact

You better count on me
To be the only black you won't see
At the club with a model pouring jokes on me
Not
Singing out of tune like (vocalizes)
I am free from you
Why do you want to judge me?
I never compare them
The city is mine
I know because I am there.

I'm getting taller
Yeah (Yeah man)
I feel it while I sleep (sing baby)
I said that I'm getting taller
Whoa
Sometimes it seems like I'll never go ahead
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we were stumbling over the speed at which life was progressing
From meeting Trey in Atlanta to making a cameo in his video, he's done everything right with his ex (Songz).

Summer 05 with the abandonment of the gray Benz
Coaler
In my Craig David shit, the horrible dodger
I showed him that I am
I said i am
About to have my career, so keep the commas
Times changed now that I'm older mom
And these niggas ain't solid, they fold in drama
And that's the most real shit I've ever written
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never notice
And hello haters
I'm back from the break
How are you doing the album?
I'm taking the cake off my last one
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city I tour
Summer time
Winter
Dinner time
Anytime
I bet I'm the black of my city when I arrive
Home
Closer to my dreams
Yes
I feel it in my dream
I said that I'm getting taller
Yes
And closer to my dreams
Sometimes it seems like I'll never go ahead
You know it's a man
You are your boy, D-R-A-K-E
I'm almost there, yes
Ha, yes
They say that all your old women have someone new
I said, "Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?"
They said, "Damn right, they were the first to go."
It is not personal
It's just that all those women you slept with have been working
They've been saving, new niggas appeared, they're waking up
With "I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They may have loved you before
But you're here doing your thing, they don't know you "
It's crazy all the emotions forgotten in a year
She says, "Why do you give a shit, you're not even here?"
Well there is nothing out there for me and I think I need to go home
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can only read your mind
You think I'm so stuck where I am now
No wonder why I'm uncomfortable with this Fashion Week shit.
No wonder why I keep fucking the double cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
A couple of artists have words for me, that's never fun
I am never afraid, they are never real, I never run
When everything is said and done, it is always said more than done
And they told me once, things will change
By a black named Tip when my deal came
He said everything is fine, even when it feels strange
Now I'm that guy who knows strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
How did a bunch of kush turn into a real mountain?
How did a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing everything
Remember how I felt at first
And now I'm living a fairy tale
And I keep trying to keep you feeling part of it
Yeah just lie to my ears
Tell me it feels the same, that's all I'm dying to hear
The lights go down and that's when I have my brightest ideas
And I heard that my city feels better than ever, that's why I have to go home
You think it got to me, I can only read your mind
You think I'm so stuck where I am now
Uh, but I think I remember everything
My mother has returned to who she was years ago.
I wish he would stop watching the women I can't stand
She thinks that I have become a slave to wealth
And I would never make up names for myself
Then change the names that I just gave myself
I used to brag about it to my friends
And now I feel like all these murderous niggas
Damn, but I bought it, I believed it
Yes i thought about it and did it
Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah clearly i was wrong all the time
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by real shit
You need credentials for each of these Toronto kids
I promised them they would see it with me, we just try to live
I told them we were about to get it and finally we did it
Tell me, who did I leave behind?
You think it got to me, I can only read your mind
You think I'm so stuck where I am now
Well, you see, what I feel about music can be copied, you know?
Well, you ask many musicians: they know it, but they can't do it.
Some people still search for this truth here
I have ice all over the windshield
I can tell it's going to be a cold winter
I came to defrost, I never turned off the heat
And I'm still a snowflake so cold
These silly billies don't really act like they know Drake
Magneto niggas tries to take down ex-men
Telling my ex-girl trying to explain
Since I'm not good, so go to the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go with the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
I know you in and out, nigga, I'm not playing
And stop trying to act like you and my team
Not us, so you hit us, that's precisely what I mean.
My presence is required in places where you have never been
Everything is in a working day, that's what I'm doing.
NBC, MTV, Viacom
Show them how monumental it is?
One wheel on the sidewalk, ticket on the board
It's like every fucking summer, I just light it up, ass
And maaan I am a commodity, none of them as good as me
Industry standard, so I'm what they have to be
Because Drake's syllables are like Jake Gyllenhaal
I can't help it, they brainwashed me to kill them all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You face glass all on your pendant
You have been an employee of a service station
Your man is a turkey, you are a liar
I'm cleaning the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spitting fire and getting the wheel
And what you plan for this summer, I did it before
I've trashed shows with tattered clothes
Met the status quos, this is the south
The start is hot but pay attention to my last flows
Giving brains is not a bad girl, do not object
Compliment hoes
And baby Dom, they always ask me: "Is it a rose?"
"You mean Rosé? Why yes?"
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house, I have the key to your home
I am A.A. driven and flown Expedia
So quit fucking my style, you need your own man
Verse 1: Drake
I always wonder why you bother putting on makeup
And although I always tell you that you are beautiful
I will repeat
Because I don't want a singer, I don't want a model
And I don't want a fashion designer or anything
I just want your love
I promise you it is more than enough for me.
Chorus:
All you have to do is make it happen
Shawty what's the deal?
Don't think it just makes you lose your appeal
I wouldn't have it any other way (2x)
Verse 2: Kyoko
Baby just because I want to look good
I don't mean that I'm not real
All clothes and hairstyles of my hair, face, nails
make me feel good
And I will continue like this
I'm not saying what you've been running
Not exactly
What I need to feel and know
You're who I'm using for
And where I always go when I need true love
Kyoko Chorus:
So stay real
What you make Me Feel
Is the true beauty of maximum appeal?
And I don't want it any other way (2x)
Yes
You all self-promoters are janky
We established ourselves as the Yankees
We move militants but somehow you are the only one
There is no limit to where I can take it
I thought we take care of each other
He saw us all as brothers in the fight, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city where I come from
All of a sudden i have people showing how much it really bothers me
All their behavior only means envy, they try to tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even if the OG tried to pressure me, ha ha ha ha ha
I will not attend when I do a show and get a ticket
A good business can clean millions, I have the vision
Even when I wasn't so poppin '
When they told me to take an R&B nigga on the go
And I said no and I drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right decisions with the world watching
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"
Those were my father's words when I asked him how to succeed in life.
And I always said my mother gave the best advice, yeah
Look at me now, look at me like the golden boy
No one can hold me
Especially not now
Certain shit is too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
There is no love in your heart, so pretend that
Damn it, nigga, what is that?
You don't listen to songs
They hit my phone like, "You did that"
It's always in some shit like
"When can I get a favor?" or "Where's my bitch?"
Costa Careyes, I have her kidnapped
Green, white and red on my body because I'm immersed in Ferrari
All he wants to do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complains, I tell the driver to drop her off at Barneys
My summer diet is just rosé and squid
Look, now you've got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace with Chris Farley
I have a lot to lose because in every situation I am the greatest artist
I always have to play smarter
You all shook, I'm here in the kitchen
Cameras pointed every time I look up
That's why I have to duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush
Sponsorship dollars are through the roof
He said, "Drake, could you stop smoking la-la?"
Chubbs, why try it? I'm a thug, I'll die high
I have pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects take dimensions, remake the entrance
Yes, redoing the entry
Kind of like when niggas fall over and over
And you still never understand
Yes i make you dance to this
Large body, wide body wheel, Calabasas road winder
Sun shinin ', waxed tires
Look at Kris Jenner, I whistle twice and wave
Gun by my bed, I'm asleep, but I'm awake
For that night when niggas try to reach my safe
Don't push me because I'm too uncomfortable today
These guys move so well today
I tell you my life and you don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for later
Just add the blows and see what you find, your SWV
Cause you're weak and I'm always on your mind
Yes and we can't stop
Make you dance to this, huh
A-ha-ha-ha, ha
Bad race, bad bwoy
That's the way it is
We had the kind of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same
Look at me, out of the way, when I should have gone home
Only the time of day that I can spend alone
I was stumbling like I used to sleep in your crib
I should drive where you live and pick you up on the road
We haven't talked in a long time, prolifically put me in the past
I can still wet you and I can still make you laugh
I should call work if that's not too much to ask
I could pour you a drink and we can burn something
Come, come, pass, pass, pass
Girl you know we have things to do
So put your butt in that car and come
You know you have what I like
Come, come, come, come in
Girl you know we have things to do
So put your butt in that car and come
Yes, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a loot stick
It's supposed to be a lot of hard work
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin?
Someone ordered a chicken (for a chicken)
I told my girl to order, I need the kitchen (I need the kitchen)
Yes, they know I connected, they just wait for me to cook
Baby, I heat the stove, you wash the dishes, you know?
Rap game, crack game, it's not that different, you know?
The last album had a vicious boom, you know?
And you know I need you back in my life
Girl you know you got that you know you got that thing I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to do it
Who used to sleep with you on the floor when you lived in the basement?
Who else has everything you need at 4 in the morning when it's late?
I always pour you a drink and let you burn something
Come, come, pass, pass, pass
Girl you know we have things to do
Girl you know we have things to do
So put your butt in that car and come
I know you, I know you have what I like
Come, come, come, come in
Girl you know we have things to do
Girl you know we have things to do
Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why was it? Why was it?
Who have you been crying with? Who have you been flying with?
What bed are you sleeping in? Someone has been hiding you
Where have you been? You deserve rounds tonight
Come through the girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through the girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through the girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh
Come through the girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through the girl you deserve rounds tonight
Yes, this is dedicated to the Canadian man
All north
Many people do not realize how cold it is during winter
But listen
I met this new girl in late June or early July
I called her many times but she hardly answered
Now it's December, I drive and she says "Where's my hello?"
It's what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter
Where Timb's laces become tighter and parka hoods lift
Drug dealers standing in their park or neighborhood
Where the girls become Summer's ex caught ho'in
Winter cars go out, summer cars go in
And some places are windy, and others start snowing
But some mothers are afraid to send their daughters to the city.
Instead, she gets a sweater that she bought out of pity.
Because mom stays up late, she saw them videos
Many girls, you know, want to get closer. you might think it's them
But just wait, it doesn't mean, take it easy
Forget about mentioning, this girl who never makes it to the beach
As I drive, I ask him how to get to the suite.
She doesn't answer, opens the door and gets into the seat.
Throw her bag from behind and start adjusting the heat.
She is bold but I'm still with it, I'm impressed because she's sweet
Then he says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat
There are a couple of things in the song that I suggest you repeat "
Outside of this, I'm a little withdrawn for a second
I receive your number, tell me to call you after this session
And so I do, and it's a little awkward, the surface is hard to scratch
I'm thinking it should have been more southern
Yes i told you i had a story for you
Uh, man, that's what it is
And now, I'm proud to have her as Montreal for the frizzench
He loves to play hurt like Carter did at the bizzench
But, my son says that I am acting different, because I lay down in the center
And I still rush to pick her up from work and fizzench
Tell everyone I'm the prince in this cold and clear city
And stupid, I just hear her
Instead of wondering if this will really last me all year
But then spring appears, and it's Dallas in this bitch
When we were together it seemed like when
The ball players get on the plane and return
See she used to play piano, and now she never waits for santa
Instead of saving for marriage, she saves for caribana
I guess I lost another one in winter
I miss you, above all, my love [Beat fades]
(give me a second to put my thoughts in order)
And watching winter turn to spring (such a beautiful day, man)
(Yes man, you know we had to turn it on, right?)
(Man, but I have something else to tell you baby)
I remember you at PM encore, breakfast and waking up
Now Drake is engaged, we look forward to the breakup
So we can go back to the brandy nights
With dress codes and light-skinned girls who won't perform well
And I laugh because my previous lifestyle was pretty wild
Winter came and its cold air blew
At the end of the week I would know that the crew
And we had put together a trio, a whole new scene
With three women in the shot, we never broke the routine
At the end of each cut when the cameras are rolling
We always had damaged and stolen ladies' hearts
But this summer is different, it's a two-man operation
In accordance with the fact that we are a short man
You have love for him, you can see this new man stop a nation
Because handlin 'crack is a one-man sport
I find a girl we dance and drink quietly
Face, chest, bras, toes
I'm still alone and a long night is coming to an end
Because it's a fact, if she comes to the crib and I get some ass inside
We will never speak again, terrifying and true
That special song that I recorded with Voyce, well, it's like a classified
Is what I'm looking to take me through
However, I can't seem to find it, every girl who owns it
And when they talk about their past and lovers
And you get mad at the idea that I give ass to others
However, you find peace with yourself, now there is less room to travel
Strolling through the park and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling through the park and watching winter turn to spring
Strolling through the park and watching winter turn to spring
That shit was crazy
I thought: 'You won. Why are you posting your text message? Just relax. Take your W, and if you feel like you don't deserve it, get better, make better music. It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilty? Do you think those guys would pay homage to you if they won?
This is how the world works: He made a music brand that attracted more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. If people want to say that he is racial, or if it is just the fact that he took advantage of something that we cannot take advantage of. This is how the cards fall. Own your shit
I have some shit for you to come find
I'm at the St. Regis in Briar Oaks
Hit me when you finished your shift
Wooh, I look good on you, baby
Are you single or what? I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky, I need a shawty from Houston
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone so proud to be with me
And say, "You don't have the juice like that
You don't have the juice like that "
That's cold, ice cream girl, you don't have to do it like that
Why did you have to do it like this?
I have to go fast, fast
Oh you at the club making money with Eric
So hit me when you finish your shift
But we're just in a different shit
She at something at 9 am already cooking in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fighting
In some "why do you love these strippers?" Shit
Oh I don't deserve it (at least you fucking know it)
She is a little too perfect, it's worth it.
I don't deserve it at all, no, not at all
I'm just texting you, man, I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yes, that's why you have to go fast, fast
Hit me when you're done
I need company, I need company
I need you to get it off my mind to be at my best
I'm a dog, I'm on heat baby, baby heat
I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm in heat baby
I'm in heat baby ...
Mo city trip! Mo City trip right now! Yes
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
Ayy, ayy, a trip to Mo City right now
Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
So let's find a place that we can take right now
It's a little lit now that you're here right now
Saturday night, in my bed right now
Call your girl and put her heels on
I'm a dog, I'm on heat baby, baby heat
I'm a dog, I'm going ham, I'm a pig
So bad bitch, I might have thought I owed you something
By the way I broke it
When she gets too much, we take off if
I drank so long that for a year I did not cough
Mo City travel right now, Mo City travel right now
Uh, black hearts in my cardigan
In the crib telling the girl we should order
Tell G to put his feet on the ottoman
We face a group of rappers, I'm going harder than
Many of these niggas swear that the coach just brought the headline
Yes, and I'm the type to tell you about your daughter
I float high, don't try to cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Load it into the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel them all, but I feel myself
Aunt Doe, tell them I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rapping like a shepherd without the snout
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talking about the applause {applause from the public}
Yes, I tried to tell you, the future will let you know
Send those who hate all my love, X and O
I have a black box where the suggestions go
But I really don't give a shit, you better know
My reality is brighter than your dreams.
I got your dream girl riding in your dream car
I hope they document what I'm becoming
Congratulations
So what do you want an award or something like that?
I don't see anything from afar but I'm far from nothing
But I'm not with the hard talk
I have a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
As I said, we take out your card and discover that you are a hallmark
I just know I'm breaking world records, there's no false start
I don't see your point unless it's at gunpoint or something
My treatment as Weezy the first week, a point something
And my verses get stupider
The phone explodes, so I'm cutting my cell phone
I'm a superstar, noticed in my nebula
I will break a leg, an arm and a fibula
When I break it, when I, when I break it
I put the beat in my back pocket and I just sit
But you could never hit my butt, pause
Again, damn, again
Everyone, pretend that we are, some men who understand it, and in
I will die before I lose, because I was born, to win
If he doesn't fuck with you then don't bother him
And yes, I take this game but I'm not going to father them
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
They tried to tell me that I would never be anything but a protégé
But if you looked at the VMA, there is nothing more to say
I have the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how do I get so nice?
I only spent it all once, to get rich twice
Surprise party, bitch, now it's on and exploding
Because money always tastes better
Chain start flow, they say "Get it off your chest"
And I'm what I fuss about
Hit me in the office, same extension
Consider me the reason why you should pay attention
Uh, black hearts in my cardigan
In the crib telling the girl we should order
Tell G to put his feet on the ottoman
We face a group of rappers, I'm going harder than
Curse! I'm so Catriona smarter than
Many of these niggas swear that the coach just brought the headline
Yes, and I'm the type to tell you about your daughter
I float high, don't try to cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Load it into the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel them all, but I feel myself
Aunt Doe, tell them I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rapping like a shepherd without the snout
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talking about the applause {applause from the public}
Yes, I tried to tell you, the future will let you know
Send those who hate all my love, X and O
I have a black box where the suggestions go
My reality is brighter than your dreams.
I got your dream girl riding in your dream car
Yes, and the visual is amazing
I hope they document what I'm becoming
Congratulations
So what do you want an award or something like that?
I'm at the private airport boarding something
I don't see anything from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll get you a card if you're bluffing
I have a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
I just know I'm breaking world records, there's no false start
I don't see your point unless it's at gunpoint or something
And my verses get stupider
Wayne, if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
The phone explodes, so I'm cutting my cell phone
I'm a superstar, noticed in my nebula
I will break a leg, an arm and a fibula
When I break it, when I, when I break it
I put the beat in my back pocket and I just sit
But you could never hit my butt, pause
Again, damn, again
Everyone, pretend that we are, some men who understand it, and in
I will die before I lose, because I was born, to win
If he doesn't fuck with you then don't bother him
And yes, I take this game but I'm not going to father them
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad called me Drake, Footz called me Drizzy
But if you looked at the VMA, there is nothing more to say
I have the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how do I get so nice?
I only spent it all once, to get rich twice
Surprise party, bitch, now it's on and exploding
I always choose the dough as if it was my only option
Because money always tastes better
Chain start flow, they say "Get it off your chest"
And I'm what I fuss about
Hit me in the office, same extension
Consider me the reason why you should pay attention
It's crack
Ayy yo Drizzy, you should have said that on the hook
You should have been like, "Congratulations, it's crack."
Yah
It's crack, hehe, congratulations.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Isn't it amazing?
How do you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our children would be, girl, I don't need to convince myself
How each conversation starts with "this time will be different"
Oh the idea is so much fun every time
At least we try home runs every time
Swinging, eyes closed, just swinging
The same city, the same friends, if you're looking for me
The same city, the same friends, if you're looking
And don't assume, cause I don't respect assumptions, baby
I'm just trying to connect with something, baby
Yeah swinging
She just wants to run around town and make memories
That you can hardly remember
And it would allow
She just wants to run over my feelings
Like I'm drinking and driving in an 18-wheeler
She used to say "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"
Yes, I appear knowing exactly who he was
And never leave like me
But when it falls apart, I'm always down
To pick up a million little pieces from the ground
I wish you learned to love people and use things
And not the other way around
Swinging, eyes closed only swanging
The same city, the same friends if you're looking for me
I'll be here just swinging
And don't assume because I don't respect the assumptions bae
I'm just trying to connect with something baby
I'll be here hanging
I'll get dressed before hanging up
I take Eglinton to 401 East
And exit on Markham Road on the east end
My license has expired. I renew it after the weekend.
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stopping for gas so late
Summer is coming, you know you can feel it
20 at the pump whatever I don't have enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle says, "You drive my whip like it's yours"
I have the pedal on the floor
I'm on my damn way, swinging
I'll be there just hanging
I'll be there just hanging
I know I'm late it's always the same shit
But don't fall asleep on me, wait there
I'm on the road right now, girl
Well my yiy just changed
I thank God you came
How many more days can I wait?
I made plans with you
And I won't let them fall

Do things when you want

They don't want me to give you anything
They don't want you to have nothing
Smiling back when they pree
Jodeci "Cry for you"
Do things when you want
How I control it, control it, yeah
And a scream entered my apartment (Woi!)
Action speaks better than plot
But you can't just get discouraged and come ask the man for forgiveness
You can't hear me talk and go tell my story, no
My old flex is my new flex now and we're working on it, yeah
And that's why I need
All the energy that you bring me
My last girl would tear me apart
But when it comes to you, you
I think i would lie for you
I think i would die for you
Do things when you want
How I control it, control it, yeah
How I control it, control it, yeah
And I'm never in a useless trash
I do it like you say you want it
The girls just wanna take my money
They don't want to see me
Smiling back when they tease (Jheeze!)
Music is a drop!

Take your nose off my keyboard
Why are you bothering me?
There's a room full of niggas
Because you follow me?
This is not a fucking song
So girl, why do you sing?
It's because we blow like a C4
I have my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Directly to the top, the roof shines
With a hand full of girls and all of them so strange
Light-skinned girl, first flight from Poland
Lots of friends, first flight from Poland
A lot of cash comes directly from Poland, why? Why
They love the crew
They love the crew
They love this crew
Oh they love the crew
Oh they love the crew
They love this crew
They love the crew
Yes
Smoking grass under stellar projectors
It took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There are times when I could do it just to do it like it was nothing
To all my soldiers just to see the appearance of all their faces
All it took was patience
I have many friends who came out of the strip for me
The same ones that will come out of my hip for me
The truest niggas say your letters shit on me
I told my story and made history
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, no
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know
They love the crew
Oh they love the crew
Oh they love the crew
Oh they love the crew
They love the crew
They love the crew
They love the crew
Whoa
I have my whole crew blowing like a C4
Yes
This in an old Tommy Campos shit says Raw, you know?
For my niggas
Uh, you underestimated him a lot
The part I love the most is that they need me more than they hate me.
So they never take pictures, I have everyone safe
I could load every gun with bullets that shoot back
I probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, I can't hear them for laughter
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just being frank with you
I mean, where do you think she is when she's not with you?
Owl sweaters inside your luggage, you have to love it
Damn this shit could go on a tape
Bitches loving my record, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse and even the hook
That's why every song sounds like Drake with Drake
It has us watching our words as if they were wiretaps on the computer
Really, some nobody started to feel themselves
A couple of people started killing each other
A couple of albums were released, they're still on the shelf
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
I'm not lying, my nigga, my time is money
That's why I don't have time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR trick like that is movement
Fuck niggas this year, I made the Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything looks beautiful
Without me, rap is just a group of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
Saving money as accumulators of multiplatinum recordings
Nothing was the same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
Whatever happens, then I have you as Uncle Phil
Weezy has been at that limit, you niggas just need to relax
If something happens to Daddy, it could blow a real nigger
But I feel good, Johnny made me push two plates
It's funny when you think a black exploded after Lupe
Niggas treats me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas have been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm trying to win here again
A young black man tries to win here again, man, what's up?
Ayy yeah, a young black man trying to win here again
If I like it, I take her to the city I'm in
I have it drinking with your boy
Got it fucked up, little girl, aww yeah
Yes, why do you keep asking me about ... (Why?)
Why am I the one you want to enter with for the drama?
I have a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wants to hear right now
Spending all my days on the east side, oh
Forgetting who was on the other side, oh
A young black man is changing the program right now
Tryna put the power in my own hands now
I'm about to break through the old hood right now
I am too proud for my own good now
Waiting for you to give in and hit me
Then it could fall like old times and hit it
I'm terrible inviting me, call me
Those nights when you need someone else, call me
When I get there, you know, call me
Why do you keep asking me about ... (Why?)
A couple of other things I'd rather do than talk about it now
I told you that you were going to give him opportunities sometimes
He's not holding you, he's holding you right now
Forgetting who was on the other side, oh
A young black man is changing the program right now
I love when your butt tells me the truth, oh
Waiting for you to give in and hit me
Then it could fall like old times and hit it
I'm terrible inviting me, call me
Those nights when you need someone else, call me
When I get there, you know, call me
Yes ayy
Ayy
Remember that one night I went to Erykah Badu's house
She made tea for me
We talk about love and what life really could be for me.
She said, "When that shit is real, you just know"
And I was thinking of you, you know
Yes, the other night Chubbs appeared at my house.
He had taken me away
May my nigga until we're gone keep your ear on the streets for me
He said the city was stressing him under
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I know that."
Girls talking, "Do you have to go yet?"
Damn, my nephew is already four years old
I gave you little help, you need more
So you know that means pussy in abundance
Mention other girls, you're already insecure
That was in the past, I've already matured
Fuck the hoes, you got the prize
You go to Chanel and you already get rewards
I know I already do this shit for Third Ward
Yes, yes
Step back into this, it's a go
It is not the first time because I lost you before
I had to get it back, I had to get it back
I had to take you back because I know you're ready to roll
All your friends ask where are you standing with the boy
FaceTime says you have plans for the boy
Studying your body, that's exams for the boy
Wake up in Amsterdam with the boy
Would you fly to Japan for the boy
You'd proliferate kill another man for the boy
You would proliferate ...
That's why you never have to worry about the boy
You just have to pack a bag and hurry up with the boy, yeah
(Why? Fring)
Ayye Yo DJ Wristpect let's go find them
Veterans like "How dare all this arrogance?"
What you expect when all they do is make comparisons between us and the Americans
And tell me to go hard, well now I'm going harder
Bumpin Shawn Carter cause there's no Shawn Carter now, sit me down
Get it, I'm trying to topple a nation using black fading as a black's only motivation
I am choosing and choosing an army and I am thinking of moving my talent.
A show of hands who is inside?
And if you must know, this year I am going for pleasure plus although the seat feels like a bus load
So take me as I am, I have nothing of me, the red stripe on my jacket shows you that Prada loves me
No blood glide shooting identity, you're a rapper, leave it to the word of Trinity Chris
So, while the clowns make toast in a cheap bar, the whole ATF makes mimosas with the clicquot
What about Nikko, Jordan, Lucky and TJ nicknamed the Night Fox clique?
You Prime Ministers Claim You Are Representing The T, I Need A Motherfucking President To Represent Me, Black
I don't even need a notepad for this here, man
Turn off the lights
I guess I'll call it my newest addition to my collection for female disappointments
Cheating on you is the reason why
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil, change wife like every season
Until you take me away to the point that you can't give
And when I see you, I pass, it's offensive
But what do you expect
Because all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told you
Mr. Edwards, I tried to save your daughter.
But she was not satisfied with any of the things I bought her
And he wasn't trying to show any of the places that I brought him
And I couldn't use any of the things that I taught him
I'm not your substitute, that's trying to outshine him
I was your other friend who tried to show you
Crown you
It's funny to think that I would have dressed you in white
Because now we sit around the studio and we play the clown
Oops i let it slide
Oh my bad, I let that slip away
I can't forget that fast
Cheating (you, you, you, cheating)
Cheating (you, you, you, you are so deceptive)
Cheating on you is the reason why
When it's cold in November it looks like it's freezing
Because when I say I'm serious, you say you're just a teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm talking to you alone on the subject when I'm angry
And in a couple of years I guarantee you will be thirsty
And by then I'll look like a Tropicana twist
What's up Tessa? I love you like my own mom.
And already daughters growing up mom
And I'm just here working waiting patiently
So she is ready to love and leave her drama
Because I really don't want to fight anymore
And I don't want to hide blacks when I don't write anymore
And I don't want to bring girls to the crib
To watch a movie in the basement in bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losing a feeling
You're losing attractiveness
Oh damn, I let it slide, oh my fault, I let it slide
I can't forget that fast
Cheating (you, you, you, cheating)
Cheating (you, you, you, you are so deceptive)
My first reaction was damn girl
How did I balance you?
I wanted you forever, now I'm something you hold on to
But you were my angel, it seems that your wings grew
Not knowing you were out of state doing your thing too
Telling myself that you're cheating
You are the reason why I don't believe in finding the love I need
In fact, I know you'll always be lying when you leave
I'm going to visit the family, promise me you're not cheating
One sure thing could go wrong
Women often behave the same as men
They group together and joke about the fact that you're a soft nigga
How do you think hugging is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't
And make you think you have your butt when you really won't
So sign your name in a prenuptial agreement and then initial
Opps, did I let it slide?
I can't forget that fast
Cheating (you, you, you, cheating)
Cheating (you, you, you, you are so deceptive)
Feel like uh
I feel like we're back man (yeah)
It's like seeing, seeing the problem with these other brothers is that they make love songs
We make songs beyond and beyond, you know what I say
We say real things that we don't embitter, it's life, you know
If the females united it
Maybe we would have something better to talk about
Diplomatic immunity, fuck it
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit will ruin me, fuck you, yeah
Cause the niggas started talking to me like I'm slowing down
Opinions on statistics, of course
Come to me and all you will get is the ballistic report
I booked a private room at Wally's, waiter turning the cork
I have multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course.
At the awards, of course, cutting the tension.
The girls hug me and then ask me, "What scent is that, boy?"
I'm walking around six as I made it up boy
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties.
They try to compare us, but
As a job straight out of high school, there's neither you nor me
I taught you everything you know, now you have student pride
I just stopped at the Solána show, the girl is natural
He knew his way back when Hollywood was international
Yes, as far as I've been, that's my word for my purposes
Word to the flags that belong to the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin 'in my residential
My body is not a sacred temple, with vodka and wine.
And sleep at opposite times
The promise shit is getting off the line like when you make a template
Or get out of line like when you break a pencil
Violating the Versailles Treaty
Champagne is the alias, but it does not stop and give up on I
I listen to heavy metal to meditate, not silence
Like Sanders in the Detroit Lions
Run and I'll bury you where they can't find you
They tell me "don't worry, I have your money" as Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
30 dirty, working on me
Tired of women who can tag me in photos airing my dirty clothes
Catering is by Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Squid and tomato rings
I have the sauce and now the shorties keep claiming preggo
Wake up at 6 PM like, "Where's the day going?"
Tornado Forecast, Brainstorm Retaliation at the Tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
However, a trip to Rotterdam had me on the front page.
I had to lie down low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed but could never stay closed
Billboard Awards, I claimed 13 in Las Vegas as Sureños
Black Excellence, but I guess when it comes to me, it's not the same, all right
That pushed me to do the things that we all couldn't
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like tall black short girls
I have to see who I'm talking to like I'm of all ages
I have seen friends racing to sit down and talk about other races, judging their peers
Cover my ears, my level of security government
Yes, advance the place so that we know the exits
If the opps make an appearance, at least it's expected
Tell them I don't want to unite like a broken necklace
I will be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
Television playing Al Jazeera
Inshallah, I hope the mission continues to clear up
I love it, I love it
Baby me
I turn off the phone, leave the seat behind
The jet setta and I'll always have chedda
And you will only receive cash when you get betta
Check luggage, flow to a new city
Also, the sweatshirt covers my eyes
I'm too pretty no I'm just playing
Heavy is like weight
The upper deck overlooking the water is where I stay
But you don't listen to me, yes, you are not relating
Well let me tell you what happens when I'm dancing
Catch me at the hotel and try to get money
You try to sex with me for money, it's pretty twisted
Before fall, I lied to everyone
So if you get a ring, I'm denying you your call
Let it be, let it do it alone
He's a G, he's just doing his thing
I have to love that
Let it go let it fall
Let it grow, if you feel where it is, let it know
Just do his thing
Now my mom is a little doubtful, my uncle is a little doubtful
Expenses at this point have cost just over fifty
The hummer and rank were in someone else's name.
I hope my city's reputation for summer changes
I hope you stay and see it
Because if you're not around, I'll bring your girl to see him
Until she takes feelings and has to let her go
And when I park my car outside, she'll stay and type
Cheap eyelash repercussions
And stick to doing crazy things
Take new jewelry and put it down the drain
Mr. Busy, Mr. Receive the shipment.
Let it breathe, let it live
Let it be, let it do it alone
Let it go let it fall
Let it grow, if you feel where it is, let it know
He just does his thing
I have to love that
When something good goes wrong it is not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world you had with a girl
And she's the reason why it happened, but she's exaggerating
And it's all because she doesn't want things to change
So cry if necessary, but I can't stay to see you
Touch if necessary, but I can't stay to hug you
That's the wrong thing to do
Speak if necessary, but I can't stay to listen to you
Because you will say that you love me, and I will end up lying
And say that I love you too
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho you know we both know
I need someone different
Oh ho you know we both know
Oh ho i know we all know
(Oh ho, oh ho)
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we are afraid to see someone else
So cry if necessary, but I can't stay to see you
That's the wrong thing to do
Speak if necessary, but I can't stay to listen to you
That's the wrong thing to do
Because you will say that you love me, and I will end up lying
And say that I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho you know we both know
I need someone different
Oh ho you know we both know
Something is missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho i know we all know
I need someone different
Someone remind me where i am
That's right, I'm at home, yes, I'm where I belong
Girl you say you feel faded, yeah me too
I know they don't get money like we do
I was looking for the
Now I feel silly for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now i'm back on this bitch
Going harder than me
And i will do it all
Feeling like the old me
You do not even know me
I will do it all
That's probably why I'm back in this bitch
Going harder than me
Watch me do it
Tonight i will break
Someone is at home
I'm drunk as always
I'm not alone (I I I)
I know you love it
Not only do
I do
I will be receiving money for so long
It's just paper for me
Be careful what you wish for, you can get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
I'm headed wherever this damn jet is routed
You can't have my heart, the doctor told me I'd be dead without him
That's why I'm constantly screaming time man time man
I'm about any man
I'm trying to fuck Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I am educated about it
I try to get the green like I'm waiting in a long light
I broke up, it just doesn't fit me girl and every night is graduation night
Where did i put my bow tie
Rest in peace to the BIG and praise the highest
Being stupid paid for smart decisions
I ask what happens and they only say the cost of living
However, I love it, I've been depressed and got up
And that I fall in love and land in love shouldn't happen
But someone shows me the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I'm still the mob, I'm still running the committee
NY forever black, Diddy
Uh yeah it's fine
While
Feel good
It's a celebration, clap-clap, bravo
Lobster and shrimp and a glass of muscat
For the girl who is a student and her friend who is a model
I finished the whole bottle and we'll make it big like this
He is not in your world, you can get him out of your atlas
Girl already on fire, can I be the one you match?
I give you the credit card and baby, you can maximize this
Show me where you are
Show me where you are, maybe I can grab it
They say that if you get it you can understand it better
And she knew it was a cheat, but that's only if you leave her
So when they talk, they try to dissuade me, it's like whatever
Tell them I appreciate the help but I just have to know for myself
This lifestyle is gross, this shit will hurt you
Especially when you think that nobody is understanding you
These girl groups with their overprotective managers
I have paparazzi on my shoulders clicking for cam-er-a
Snap snap snap until card space is exhausted
You remind me of Tony's sister in Scarface
Just take it easy in love and lower your heart rate
Kindness on top is such a difficult place
Yes ... but if you've never been there
You make sense why you're dying to pretend
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in swimwear ya
Head to the clouds you survive in midair
And maybe you don't need help but I just want to see for myself
Hand on my heart
Yes, although Stylin
All the things you need, you still want trouble
Of all the things I know, I'm still silent
Yes, I used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I have to start sleeping in the study
I don't have time not to be Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho.
Who knows where it ends when that shit ages?
Maybe it never goes out of style and that's how it goes
I take a glass of Domina to go home with me
I could move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm doing
Yes, I dodged many spiteful movements
I was angry when I wrote Views
I saw a side of myself that I never knew
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Constant doing double shift
1 doin 'the beat and I open like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for ten of us
She knew that shit was a fraud, but she never told me.
Nowadays when we catch up we just laugh about it
I can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Fear every time I close my eyes at night
Wake up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep until morning on all my quiet nights
But you can be sure my mind is right
I have no sick days, I go like three months in six days
Never stay to see the shit change
Get small updates, texts in my inboxes have been showing up
The seasons go by like I'm compulsively watching
I went from Club Palazzo on the Bridge to Club LIV
I can't even party while a nigga chases this
Distractions will get you in, in the truest sense
Or look for me, whatever divides it
So there is more for them and there is less for me
They don't know that they have to be faster than me to get to me.
No one has successfully done it
7 in the morning in Germany, I can't believe you heard about me
The last verse I have to do is always like surgery
Always trying to let go of anything that overwhelms me
That is the reason why you can feel the tension and the urgency.
Last chance to make sure you take it personally
Take this shit seriously, it always runs perfectly
If we make a song it's like asking my children to work with me
You are a celebrity overnight, you are a star day
I swear I told you I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all your insecurities.
Behind closed doors, many 6 worship God
I already spoke, because there is another shit that worries me
I want to make sure that they learn from me
You can't even dive in to see me in an emergency.
Taking the summer off, cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe going back to my normal life will humiliate me
I will be back in 2018 to give you the rundown.
More life
I sent a message to my Instagram
Lotta niggas, lotta niggas
Lotta niggas wanna be like me
But you know the difference
I've only been OVO to myself
Let me know you're depressed
Ring-a-ding, ding
Let me know if it's a ting, yeah
Out here with your Brampton clinks
Fucking all your Pickering stuff, oh
She said she wanted to come to Toronto
She wants to come next 6
She knows that's the best side
Caribana, soca dancer, Machel Montano
Black red scarf, oh trip planner
She knows who to consult when she comes
She knows who to consult every time she comes to town
She knows what I have to calm her down
She knows it's not something from now on, oh
Do not run
I want to smoke with you
Sit down, have dinner with the people who are with you
Touch the road, do Fring and then Bloke with you
Don't stop with a bankrupt boy, I'll do my best
Would you tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me?
Since when are you an adult?
Since when do you know Mona?
Since when do you not come home?
Your mother just called my phone
It seems your party is over
I know you're depressed, I know you're still depressed
Ring-a-ding, ding
Let me know if it's a jingle
I'm left with the ting of the center
Who's the real king of Queenstreet, oh
She said she wanted to come to Toronto
She wants to come next 6
She knows that's the best side
Caribana, calypso dancer, Bajan accent
She knows who to consult when she comes
She knows who to consult every time she comes to town
She knows what I have to calm her down
Do not run
Rrrr Ting (Brrt, brrt)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (Ga, grrra-ga-ga-ga-ga)
Get hurt (get hurt)
Aww, here's another muhfucker that I don't understand
I'm about to hit you with work, boy (work)
I hate coming through stunts on niggas I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy (the worst)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (I'll admit it)
You haven't been the man for a minute
I told you I'm in this for the long haul
You can really get the business (Get it)
Made me feel like a pig
I don't pass them when I get it (Naw)
I'll admit it, I'll admit it (Why?)
You cared about bitches too (Why did you care?)
I have a girl, and she is my girl, and no one else can hit her (try a ting)
She ain't fucking with you niggas
You can have it when it's over (why?)
I hear talk on the highway, I'm the shit, boy
Phone call home, shit is hot on 6, boy (Hot on 6)
Hot shit on 6 right now
Hot shit on 6, boy (Hot on 6)
Shit is hot on 6 right now (Ga, ga, ga)
Come see us and fix it, boy (Hey)
Black Benz on the road, boy (On the road)
Sold a pair of Bentley last week
They were my old toys (Man, this shit is old)
I don't give a damn old, boy (man, that old boy)
I don't give a shit about your mob, boy (Oh)
I'm the real god 6 boy (whoa)
I'm about to say something true (yeah)
I'm about to say something true (yeah)
You were returning when Usher wore a U-chain
Damn you changed
It is an OVO to come through murky things
I know you heard things
Yes, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from fucking side 6
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't come this way
I'm not new to this, I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah i know you heard things
No one really likes us except us
Yeah, all I needed was the squad, so that's what happens
Yeah my sound has the whole city on your way right now
Yeah so i don't care what they say right now
Don't you have a man? (Don't you have a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
Don't you have a man? (Don't you have a man?)
Everything is fine with me, my girl
We can not do anything
Why are you there looking at me?
The temporary happiness that he could bring you
I know I feel it, but slowly I'm a bit like
"I really don't want to hit this girl"
And then she wants this guy's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'll give it to you, corsages
You feel it all under your ribs like some abs
All my other girls are in that subtle shit
They don't want to cut it, they want a rapper to hug it
So when she thinks I'm serious, I'm playing
It gets deeper and colder-ER, the funny thing is
I'm writing this in my head and she sleeps on my shoulder like ...
Don't you have a man? (Don't you have a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
Don't you have a man? (Don't you have a man?)
Everything is fine with me, my girl
We can not do anything
Look ... we had a little thing, a winter adventure
Any recovery for your abused man
But that was then, you know a little silence
Also your man is still there, let's be fair
You will do the same to me
I don't want to take his place!
Afternoon 85 south on my way to the crib
And someone got me a song
I know what it is, because I've been the other man
And you won't catch me with a silly plan
It's my wrong, I should have chosen a man
But I'm in the mix with this little girl playing
I'm saying you must do what you do
I'm not trying to take it any further, come on
Don't you have a man? (Don't you have a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
Don't you have a man? (Don't you have a man?)
Everything is fine with me, my girl
We can not do anything
Uh ... uh ... I met her at the bar drinking Patron
And now it's been three years now and then
Because the same page, we are rarely once in a while
Because when I'm in, she goes out, and when she comes in, I go (come on)
We lost contact as Bausch & Lomb
But he got it back while he was building a home in his house
It just shows that you don't know what to do with your life.
Because if so, you wouldn't have to change your strategy
One minute she is mad at me, the next minute everything is fine
And I'm in his body like Gray's Anatomy
And I can't try to justify that filthy shit we do (uh)
All I know is that every time I'm hitting you
I think to myself: "Damn, if only his black knew it", but ...
Don't you have a man? (Don't you have a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can not believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you have a man?)
Everything is fine with me, my girl
We can not do anything
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
I'm a little satisfied, why you niggas want it all?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
Do what you do, do what I do
Coming down tonight if they say you're cutting
Many guys in my city don't say anything
And these labels do not give advances, so you do not pay
How much does it cost? Fans keep trying to guess it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef, I'm on my way
And the Black Ghost is here soon when Visalia comes out
Both offers, nothing under a mill
We know you have to give and we are trying to pick it up
As long as it's warm in the winter
Drake known as a professional, I'm going to teach you beginners
'Over the ink with a larger as sheets through a printer
For the features, you better bring me while it's cheaper than dinner
Because me and I try to reach your girl
If you see her, tell this nigga that he has some blows, Imma, send her
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
My niggas relax, why do you niggas want a ball?
I'm a little satisfied, why you niggas want it all?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
Do what you do, do what I do
My niggas relax, why do you niggas want a ball?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
Do what you do, do what I do
Look, the verses that I'm writing, maybe you want to learn it
You hate my song but your wife wants to burn it
So now you're in the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, maybe you want to return it
Cause if you bring records home baby
She will forget you and I will be the only one who cares
To the people who ignored me before this
This is for you like a rerecorded song
But I was here, your vision just got distorted
I'm so excited, wilin 'on this, you ask me what's the business
The wait is over, I think music is needed
Drake cutting his discs without passing out
People in the south want me to be stung and fucked
I have this guy, they hope I get over it
You all record and when you're done your lyrics tend to fool the shit
I'm finally a star over time
My arrogance is cold and my flow is reclined
This for anyone looking for cash
And then I move like I'm listening to Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyme, boy
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
My niggas relax, why do you niggas want a ball?
I'm a little satisfied, why you niggas want it all?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
My niggas relax, why do you niggas want a ball?
I'm a little satisfied, why you niggas want it all?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
Do what you do, do what I do
Two years ago a friend of mine
And then I sent him a rhyme, it was cool to death
Now not signing is something the rest regret
So I jumped into the Cadillac
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
My niggas relax, why do you niggas want a ball?
I'm a little satisfied, why you niggas want it all?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
Do what you do, do what I do
I do this for you, man
Malice, Nickelus F, is the REMIX!
Lights in slow motion, coming out of the Phantom
All eyes on me, staring and staring
Leaning against the wall, with b-boys dancing
The ears, neck and wrists resemble the king's rescue.
A girl, each arm, making it a tandem
Flat here that costs' like fifty great standards
Poppin 'bottle options, cars wit'
And I'm a show for you, marble flo 'for you
Diamonds in the Jesus, seems to blush
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Accusations escaped, thank you Jesus
All the haters have no idea
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
I'm satisfied with a little bit, why do haters want it all?
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
Do what you do, do what I do
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
My people relax, why do you hate you want the ball?
I'm satisfied with a little bit, why do haters want it all?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
Do what you do, do what I do
Look, the verses that I'm writing, maybe you want to learn it
You hate my song but your wife wants to burn it
So now you're in the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake you may want to return it
Cause if you bring records home girl, she will forget you
And I'll be the only one who cares
The funny thing is that you have noticed me now, but I was here the whole time.
Your vision just got distorted
And I write a sixteen and report it
The wait is over, I think the music needs it
Drake cut his records without being stripped
People in the south want it chopped up and fucked up, I got this guy
They hope I get over it
Like a singer with just a record, you'll record it
When it's done, the letters tend to confuse ish
I'm finally a star over time
My arrogance is cold and my flow is reclined
And then I move like I'm listening to Wayne
My pain, you can experience it through the rhyme, boy!
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
My people relax, why do you hate you want the ball?
Do what you do, do what I do
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
My people relax, why do you hate you want the ball?
I'm satisfied with a little bit, why do haters want it all?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
Do what you do, do what I do
Ugh, do what you do and I do what I do
These girls love me, they say boy, you're clean for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush to the club
It's like an offensive foul how they run towards us
Sir, I hooked them up like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, in addition to the eggs and the ham.
Let the fool burn, I don't even turn them around
Nickelus F. joined Drake, now you're crazy as hell
I haven't seen a more attractive marriage since Gabrielle
Well I'm hot as hell and I don't even need a stylist
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You are climbing our animals like white children, they have a cow tip
Everyone knows Cap from South Wallis
I don't have to use a fist, hit you with the chalice
My people relax, why do you hate you want the ball?
I'm satisfied with a little bit, why do haters want it all?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
Do what you do, do what I do
Lean pose, leg up on the wall
My people relax, why do you hate you want the ball?
I'm satisfied with a little bit, why do haters want it all?
You are waiting for spring, and I will receive it in autumn
But hey, do what you do what you do, I do what I do
(Careful, careful)
(Careful, careful)
Yes
(Careful, careful)
Yes
Draft day, Johnny Manziel
Five years later, how am I still the man?
Draft day, A. Wiggins
Fuck that other side, bitch, we keep winning
Aww man, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for you
Yes, suits and ties screaming, "Pay the boys."
Man I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for you
Man, you know I had to ...
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm probably your darkest angel but you still have me
I'm wearing mine, but still live better
And I put that shit aside to make sure my people passed
You know it's real when your niggas will fall for you
All loyal, so you keep cheering me on
And we'll have to break a shell just to test you, you're not hard, mm
I tried some raw oysters last night
Man, that boy grows up fast, that boy knows he sucks
That boy singing in every song when he knows he can spit
That child manifested it, that child knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
And if I left this shit to chance, I would have chosen a name like Chance the Rapper
Yes, don't be offended because I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and getting bigger
Tell them to fix my suite because I'm going home
I heard they were talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to break all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, it's not a sound, that will make me explode, write it down
Enter the cabin and lay a body down
Meet some Somalis who say we have it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for you in the lobby
Look what I say goes, I play like I'm on roids, not Canseco
I think I'm on my eighth stream, just watch me paint the stream
We all do it for art, so I could never hate
Signing in more business than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How does the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the hell happened to such and such, where did they go?
Too concerned with bitches and fashion, they get lost in action
In a Hunger Games shit, I'd die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, can you really understand it, yeah
I mean, really, girl, you know I had to do it for you
You know I had to do it for you
You know I had to ... oh wait, sidebar, I left some rhythm at the end
SZN

It's hard to go from the children's TV show to the rapper
It is, it is, but you know, the more and more we were consistent, he showed, he went from being a defect to an attribute. You know, it kind of improves the story, I think at this point
We start by simply putting out songs
Every, every, as I said, I am very humbled by that, I feel very blessed. And umm, yeah, I will never let it settle, I just want to keep going, I just want to keep working to be honest with you
Ride the wave, baby ride the wave And you also have a great interest, as I know you are working. There's one with Lil 'Wayne, and you, umm, just talked to a few different people in the studio, can you talk about it or not?
I've been working, I've been working all week with some of the best artists in New York City. I haven't been working with the best in New York City

EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON SWEET THING
Forever five
I i i. This is your boy, Christopher [?], True, [?], Relaxing with my main man, Drake. On the hook of this tape. You know how we got depressed. This is how we do it, the real home party, baby. Come on, come on, come on!
What happens? This Kim Damn, I've been trying to reach you all week. Why do not you call me?
Okay, I lied. Damn, I swear. Just call me
Good! Good! [?] hit him too! Why don't you call me back?
Hey, Drake, you never answer your damn phone, huh? Pick up the phone, man. I know they have you running, brother. Anyway, everything's fine with Socrates hooking you up, asshole. Hello, my best wishes for this tape. I hope you take over the world. You know we will. Be sure to take me there. You call me when you need that hook, you call me when you need that beat, you call me when you need that [hot 16], bro, and let's put all this math together, dawg. Once again, it's a whole gang for Room for Improvement, so we're about to take over this year, right? Right
Hi Drake, what's up? This is Keeyaga, your boy here. Umm, I don't know why you're not picking up the phone, you're probably out, you know, talking to Lindsay Lohan, or eventually you will be talking to her. But, look, it's your Keeyaga boy. I'm just calling to tell you what, I haven't spoken to you forever, indefinitely. You know, we have to go, you know, to downtown Toronto, kick him and do what we have to do, but, I have to, you know, hang up the phone because I have, you know, Beyoncé, you know, even Mendes all in the another line. So do what you have to do and yell at your boy. All the best. Peace
Are you ready, B?
Let's go find them
Find me!
Doing what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shadows
But today I carry my strongest girl with me
Only the time we don't talk is during Sex and the City
She has Carrie's fever, but as soon as the show ends
She has become my soldier again
‘Because mommy is a rider and I am a roller
Put us together, how will they stop us both?
What's missing, I'm right on your shoulder
When I'm off track, mommy keeps me focused
So let's block this how it's supposed to be
Down to the end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to the end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
The problem is that you guys treat the one you love
With the same respect with which you treat the one you hump
That's nothing
If you're ever crazy about something
I'm not in places where we feel comfortable
Without support, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I'm not perfect
No one walking on the surface of this earth is
But girlfriend, work with the boy
I keep you working on that Hermès Birkin bag
The only time you use Burberry for swimming
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She does whatever it takes for him
And I do whatever it takes for her
So don't let the necessary happen, yeah!
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to the end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
I will be there for you, if someone hurts you
Even if that someone was me (That's right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it for them, B!)
Sometimes I trip over how happy we could be
And then I put this in my life
No one and nothing will come between us
And I promise to give my life
My love and my trust if you were my boyfriend (once again!)
Put this in my life
The air I breathe, everything I believe in
I promise to give my life
And all my confidence if you were my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to the end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
Down to the end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
"My life has to be like this, it has to keep going up."
"I've been to various things, I was in the drug business, then I was in the oil business, but now I'm not in either, you understand?"
"I had my own little separate business, some kind of secondary activity ... something quite confidential ... but you could make a little money."
One hundred dollar bills
Benjamin Franklins packed, fold it just for the thrill
It numbs me until I can't feel, or can take this pill
Stock markets just collapse, now I'm just an invoice
History does not repeat, rhyme, 1929, still
Write like Mark Twain, Jay Gatsby, park things
Yellow cars, yellow gold like Slick Rick, still rolling over
Dollars fall on the skin, some might call it sin
All politicians move for money, what the hell do we call them?
Low life, I'm crawling, 911, I pulled it out
You all niggas all hypocrites know what this shit is about
Hunnid, dolla, hunnid dolla bill, real, huh
"His voice is full of money."
"I didn't want you to think it was nobody."
"We were born different. It is in our blood."
New heroines, new Marilyns, move cocaine through Maryland
Through Easton, oh you're beating up
Move the fat packages, Jack Gleason
The honeymoon is over with the shitty streets
Less see my kids on the weekend
Carter, new Kennedy
No ordinary Joe, will you remember me
There is no prohibition for my coalition.
You're welcome, new Malcolm, talc
"Let's Get It On", new Marvin
Semi-automatic or revolver, semi-automatic, I will solve them
Einstein, my mind, this MC moves white squares with my relatives
Took Taylor Swift a hundred million whores, bitch
I'm going to let them continue but ... hahaha ...
"So is!"
"Who is he, anyway, an actor?"
"Meyer? No, he is a player. He is the man who arranged the 1919 World Series."
"Fixed up?"
"Fixed up."
"Well how did you do that?"
I need hunnid bricks in them hunnid blocks
I have a few hunnid drops, I took a hunnid police, uh
A hunnid block, I need hunnid bricks in them hunnid blocks, uh
Decade of decline, bad reverence, irreverence
Decade of decline, bad reverence, irreverence
Uh, young man, uh
I need hunnid bricks in them hunnid blocks
I have a hunnid, I have a hunnid drops
I need a hunnid, I have a hunnid
I have a hunnid, hunnid, huh
Hunnid, dolla, bill, real
You don't have enough stamps in your passport
International, uhh
Teach children how to do this.
The maturing of Jay-Zeezy, je
Check me out
Better wide, better car (uhh)
Bet a yard (no!) Bet a hundred thousand
That at the end of the song I'll probably start another trend
I know everything you want to do
At 22, I had that new coupe Ac '
I guess you could say my legend has just started
I'm young enough to know the right car to buy
However, it grew enough not to put tires on it
I have that six deuce with curtains so you don't see me
And I didn't even have to dye it
I don't have the shiny watch, I have the right watch
I don't buy the bar, I bought the nightclub
I have stockbrokers who are moving it like white tops
I must be getting better
You guys aren't really ready
30 is the new 20 nigga, I'm still so hot
I used to let my pants fall off without giving me a fuck
Baby boy I'm all grown up now
I used to navigate the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy I'm all grown up now
I used to play the block like this (like this)
I used to wear knots like this (like this)
Now I have black cards, good credit and so on.
Baby boy because I'm old, taha!
These young boys are like fire drills (uhh)
False alarms (uhh) the next gift (naw)
Don't have it (uhh) in the next (Young)
I'm still here (yeah) still here like Mike
I have to stop playing with these children (stingy)
I'm a bully with the dollars (boots)
I have completely in the tuxedo
That was my past, now I'm so big
I have to pay a sum to hire an army of weapons, make you spin like clothes
And I'll be somewhere under palm trees, quietly listening to R&B
You little folks really back off
30 is the new 20 nigga, I'm still so hot
I used to let my pants fall off without giving me a fuck
Baby boy I'm all grown up now
Baby boy I'm all grown up now
I used to wear my hoodie like this (like this)
Baby boy because I'm old, hehehe
You roll blunt, I smoke Cubans all day
I like South Beach but I'm in St. Tropez
My girl burning Bergdorf's
Already girl is like, "What kind of bag is that?"
I'm from the era where blacks don't make fun
You're from the era where snitchin 'the shit
I am afraid of the future (why?)
Everyone respect the one who was shot, respect the shooter
You guys go to parties on the ice grill
Young boys have to relax
30 is the new 20 nigga, I'm still so hot
I used to let my pants fall off without giving me a fuck
Baby boy I'm all grown up now
I used to navigate the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Now we own the ball team, holla back (holla back)
Now I have black cards, good credit and so on.
Baby boy because I'm old, taha!
D-P, D-P, D-P 3
3, 3, 3, D-P 3
While others spit that shit out of Wonderama
Same crime, bigger trial, his lordship sucks a dick
Fuck all of you, driving from a teenager
Like LeBron or Sebastian, high school graduates
Get it? I was kneading this dough
Me, my life is not rosy, but I keep going
My mind was fine until the dough hit her
And now he's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit in the diamond in the visits of San Tropé
Young is just as nice and riskier than '96, KID
The Washingtons go to wife, you know how that goes
Jacksons returns then we copy a little more
The youngest go to the hiding place under the floor
I'm out of the presidents to represent me, now you know
D-P 3, D-P 3
My boy Sig said
I was on a level where no tears can fall
Because he was on the block where no squares were taking off
Look in my inner circle, all we do is ball
Until we all have triangles on our wall
It's not just rapping for platinum, you all log
I remember, because I've really been there before
Never too far, because I think too far
All about routine like me so horny
I warned you from the start about my mindset
You thought it was an empty bomb threat
Until I flew into the building like 100 Osamas
He said make a few million
Expose the world to the true feelings of a scammer
I entered this game with nothing to prove
You'll never stop a nigga with that kind of humor
So every move I make confuses the industry
I'm out of the presidents to represent me
D-P 3
D-P 3
The Washingtons go to wife, you know how that goes
Jacksons returns then we copy a little more
The youngest go to the hiding place under the floor
I'm out of the presidents to represent me, now you know
D-P 3
Shawn Carter was born on December 4, weighing in at 10 pounds 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one that didn't cause me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew he was a special boy.
They say, "They never really miss you until you're dead or gone."
In that sense, I'm leaving after the song
So you don't have to feel bad for Jay, so long
At least let me tell you why I'm like this, wait
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree?
What makes me a sicker MC, and my mom would say
At 10 pounds, when I was born, I gave him no pain
Although over the years I gave him his fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I gave birth when I got here
She knows that my purpose was not the purpose; I'm not perfect, I care
But I feel useless because my shirts didn't match my outfit
Because what is buried under there
He was a broken boy once his pop disappeared
I went to school, I got good grades, I could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that arose when faced
Shawn was a very shy boy growing up. He liked sports, and a fun story is at age 4 that he learned to ride a bike. A two-wheeled vehicle, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when my husband and I finished.
Now all the teachers could not contact me
And my mom couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match my parents' pain without seeing me
So with that disdain on my membrane
I got into my pimp game; fuck the world my defense came
The Spanish José introduced me to 'Caine, now I am a swindler
My team is in and I'm in the crowd
And all the fair skinned wavy girls are loving me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my loot
I got a Volvo from this girl when her man was bagged
Also, I hit my mom with cash from a program I had
Supposedly knowing that no one paid Jaz
I am getting ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap
But that was the second for me moving this crack
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, hitting the table and rapping into the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them crazy. But that was my way of keeping him close to me and out of trouble.
Goodbye to the game, all the loot, the adrenaline
Your blood boils you on the spot, knowing that the cops could rush
And you in a drop, you are so easy to touch
And "trust" is a word you rarely hear from us
You learn the value of water without work
You are thirsty until you die, yes!
And blacks are tied for the product
And the little brothers' ring fingers are cut off
To show mothers that they really have them
Until I decided to try this rap shit for a life, I pray they'll forgive me
For every bad decision I made, every sister I played
‘Because I'm still paranoid to this day
This is the life that I chose, or rather, the life that chose me.
Maybe you will love me when I fade away
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is crazy
Maybe you will love me when I fade away
Maybe you will love me when I fade away
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is crazy
Maybe you will love me when I fade away ...
And that's why I wrote this book. I love to write rhymes. There's probably nothing that gives me so much pleasure. There were times in my life when I tried to put it aside: when I was a kid, so I could focus on rushing on the streets and when I was an adult, so I could focus on rushing the boardroom, but the words kept coming. They are still coming and will probably never stop. That's my story.But the history of culture in general is the story of a million MCs from all over the world who look out their windows or stand on street corners or ride their cars through their cities or suburbs or towns. small and within them come the words, too, the words they need to make sense of the world they see around them. The words are witty and forceful, abstract and linear, sober and fucked up. And when we decode that torrent of words, by which I really mean listening to them with our minds and hearts open, we can better understand their world. And ours too. It is the same world.
Part 1
My life after childhood has two main stories: the scammer story and the rapper story, and the two overlap as much as they diverge. I have been on the street for more than half of my life since I was thirteen. People sometimes say that I am now so far from that life, now that I have businesses, Grammys and magazine covers, that I have no right to rap about it. But how distant will the story of your own life be? The feelings I had during that part of my life were imprinted on me as a brand. It was life in times of war. In "Public Service Announcement"
Even when a rapper is just rapping about how silly he is, something a little deeper is happening. It's like a sonnet, believe it or not. Sonnets have an established structure, but also a limited theme. They are mostly about love. Talking about such a familiar topic and writing about it in an established structure forced sonnet writers to find every corner of the topic and challenged them to invent a new language to say old things. It's the same with braggadacio in rap. When we take the most familiar theme in rap history, why am I stupid, and frame it within the sixteen-bar structure of a rap verse, synchronized to the specific beat and feel of the track, more than anything it's a proof of creativity and ingenuity. It is like a metaphor in itself; If you can tell how silly you are in a completely original, intelligent, and powerful way, the rhyme itself becomes proof of the truth of boasting. And there are always deeper layers of meaning buried in the simplest verses of the Negative Space section
Hip-hop has always been controversial and for good reason. When you watch a kids show and they have a muppet rap about the alphabet, it's cool, but it's not really hip-hop. Music is meant to be provocative, which does not mean it is necessarily unpleasant, but it is (mostly) confrontational, and more than that, it is dense with multiple meanings. Great rap should have all kinds of unresolved layers that you don't necessarily discover the first time you listen to it. Instead, plant dissonance in your head. You can enjoy a song that plays in the club or has clever phrases the first time you listen to it. But the great rap preserves the mystery. Leave some shit in your head that won't make sense until the fifth or sixth time. Challenges you
That's the other reason hip-hop is controversial: People don't bother trying to get it. The problem is not in rap or rapper or culture. The problem is that many people don't even know how to listen to music.
Since rap is poetry, and a good MC is a good poet, you can't half listen to a song and think you already have it. This is what I mean: the mission of a poet is to make words work more than normal, so that they work on more than one level. For example, a poet makes words work soundly, like sounds, like music. Traditionally, hip-hop tracks have been heavy on the rhythms, light on the melody, but some MCs, for example, Bone Thugs ‘N Harmony, find ways to incorporate melodies into rap. Other MCs - think Run from Run-DMC - turn words into percussion: cool boss rocks, I don't drink vodka, but I keep a bag of cheeba inside my locka. The words themselves don't mean much, but he breaks those clipped syllables like drum, bap bap bapbap. It is as exciting as watching a middleweight throw a perfect combination. If you listened to that joint and came out thinking it was just a rhyme about keeping the grass in a gym locker, you'd be reading it wrong: the goal of those bars is to get a rhythmic idea, not be impressed with the literal meaning of the words
But I can't say that I really cared about people who hear a curse and start foaming at the mouth. Fox News mannequins. They wouldn't know art if it fell on them.
Part 2: I WILL NOT LOSE
What is the basic motivation for a scammer? I went out for the same reason as many other children: I wanted money and excitement and I liked the idea of freeing myself from the rules and low ceilings of the heterosexual world. The truth is, most kids in the corner aren't making a lot of money, especially if you divide your income into hourly wages. * But they are being rewarded in ways that go beyond dollars and cents. The child on the streets has an opportunity to dream. The dream is that he will be the only one to make this hustle big. He sees the guy who gets rich and drives the nice car and thinks, yes, that will be me. Ignore the other stories that circulate, about guys being shot or beaten to death with bricks and chains. But they are working in that corner for more than any small cut they get from the crack they sell: they are working because they owe a miracle. The kid at McDonald's gets a check and that's it. There is no dream in fast food. Manager? That is a promotion, not a dream. It took me a long time to realize the bravery it took to work at McDonald's, to walk the streets passing rows of scam artists wearing that orange uniform. But at the time, it seemed like an act of surrender to a world that hated us. I never considered it a possibility.
When you have a nation of scammers working for a small number of slot machines, you learn something you will never learn at McDonald's. You learn to compete hard, even when you lose, because you can't settle for second best as a scammer. That is not worth it. The only reason to do it is for the first place, for the number one position ... Kind of like the music business. * The hourly wage [of the gang leader] was $ 66 ... foot soldiers earned just $ 3.30 an hour. In other words, a crack gang works more or less like the standard capitalist firm: you must be near the top of the pyramid to earn a big salary ... so if the crack business is the most dangerous job in America And if the wage is only $ 3.30 an hour, why would someone take the job?

Part 3: POLICY AS A HABITUAL
The poor generally have a twisted relationship with the government. We are aware of the government from the moment we are born. We live in government-funded housing and work in government jobs. We have family and friends who spend time in the best public housing, prison. We grow up meeting people who pay for everything with small plastic cards: Medicare check-up cards, EBT food cards. We know what AFDC and WIC mean and we are waiting hours waiting for government cheese bricks. The first and the fifteenth of each month are times of maximum economic activity. We get to know all kinds of government agencies not because of the kind of civic education, but because they really visit our homes and sit on our couches asking questions. Since we are little children we go to ruined public schools that tell us everything we need to know about what the government thinks of us.
Then there are the cops.
Housing projects are a great metaphor for the government's relationship with poor people: these huge islands built primarily in the middle of nowhere, designed to store lives. However, people are still people, so we turn projects into real communities, poor or not. We played fire hydrants and had cookouts and parties, music bouncing off the concrete walls. But even when we were able to shake off the weight of those towering buildings and simply try to live, the truth of our lives and struggle remained invisible to the country as a whole. The rest of the country was released from any obligation to claim us. Which was fine, because we weren't really claiming them either.
When I started working on this book, I told my publisher that I wanted him to do three important things. The first was to demonstrate that hip-hop lyrics, not just my lyrics, but those of every great MC, are poetry if you look closely enough. The second was that I wanted the book to tell a little bit of the story of my generation, to show the context of the choices we made at a violent and chaotic crossroads in recent history. And the third part was that he wanted the book to show how hip-hop created a way to take a very specific and powerful experience and turn it into a story that everyone in the world could feel and relate to.
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
"The Illuminati want my mind, my soul and my body"
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
"Secret society, try to keep an eye on me"
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
"I cannot die, I cannot die, I cannot die"
This shit is wicked on these bad streets
None of my friends speak, we all try to win
But then again, maybe it's for the best
You know they're trying to make you touch
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
I couldn't understand the mechanics
And the operation of the underworld, granted
Nine to five is how you survive, I'm not trying to survive
I'm trying to live it to the limit and love it a lot
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
I'm not asking for forgiveness for my sins, it ends
It gets dangerous, money and power are changing us
"The Illuminati want my mind, my soul and my body"
"Secret society, try to keep an eye on me"
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
"The Illuminati want my mind, my soul and my body"
"I cannot die, I cannot die, I cannot die"
We used to fight for the building blocks
Now we fight for blocks with buildings that make a killing
The closest of friends when we start
But it parted as the money grew and soon turned black
Thinking about the first time we learned to use rubbers
He never learned, so I'm kidnapping his baby's mother in turn
My hand around her neck, feeding her cheese
I was not convinced about his whereabouts
I kept feeding his money until his shit started to make sense
Who could foresee?
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now i'm trying to shake your bitch to sleep
Every year we were very close
Now I see her fears through her tears.
Don't cry, it is being; on time
I will take your miseries and make them mine, D'evils
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
"The Illuminati want my mind, my soul and my body"
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
"Secret society, try to keep an eye on me"
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
"Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?"
"I cannot die, I cannot die, I cannot die"
My flesh that no black could taste, my soul is possessed
By D'evils in the form of diamonds and Lexuses
The exorcist made me stick
Like, "Homie, you don't know me
But everyone owes me, shoot! "
I thought he was a nice guy all my fucking life
So now I'm depressed for whatever it is, it's not nice
During my high school years everything was friendly
But now this higher learning has the Remy in me
The liquor invaded my kidneys
Prepared me to lick - Mom, forgive me
I gotta run with guys, make G's, tell lies that ring true
Come try me, I never shrink
For the love of money, son, I'm taking showers of lead
And even if Jehovah testifies, I bet he will never testify, D'evils
"I cannot die, I cannot die, I cannot die"
can you hear me now Good! (Plane 2 baby!)
The best of times was the worst of times (aoww)
R.O.C. Yes, the number one clique here
If you represent us, throw them diamonds YES
Now that you know, holla to your boy
HOV '.. (Hov', Hov ', Hov')
(Hov ', Hov', Hov ', Hov')
Yes, Roc-A-Fella Records
You know what the diamond is
We won't go anywhere, put your diamonds
Standing in my b-boy stance
(Right here) snatch Cam and it's a wrap
This rap here belongs to us, no one as strong as us, it's a fact
Wait, I'm just warming up, give me a second to get it back
Young Chris, Neef what? Oschino and sparks
Next summer next summer, tear this motherfucker apart
Young is eternal, my young will burn you
"The Blueprint" was born, nigga, I grounded you, you can't be serious
Young because I'm thirty-two years old, dressed like I'm twenty-two
Flow like an 18, do what I want to do
Rose gold with black carats, horse and chariot to spend
Like Mason Betha, chasing this cheddar to the end
Of the road because the end tell me that it is closer than we know
What can I say but live for today, HOV '!
R.O.C. Yes, the number one clique here
If you represent us, throw them diamonds YES
Now that you know, holla to your boy
HOV '.. (Hov', Hov ', Hov')
Yes, friend of The Blueprint 2, follow the movements
You wear two tube socks, you can't walk in my shoes
They gave me a bad hand, dammit, what else could I do?
But can you believe, wherever you are, models come through
Cat-fightin ', cat-walkin', it happens often
It is true that society does not want me to move
In the attic with spectacular views.
They are like uhh, "It's a threat, I could never be a tenant"
I bring the brothers to the building, it seems that no
Give it a shit, we just chill out watching high spider ceilings like shit
Old woman, don't explode
Sharpton on it because I'm dark skinned or
Friend with the Fro and Rainbow Coalition, I am
Victim of a single parent home, born in a mouse hole
Mousetrap, niggas wanna know
How is it, how does Jay get up that, here, yeah?
I took wallets, per se-vered, yeah
I had a job, demons bought, it was clear
I was there selling hope of despair, but for there
I swear, I only do good to my mouth to the ears of God
I had to get out of the hood
And I can't justify genocide
But I was born in the city where skinny niggas die
Born in the city where skinny niggas ride
And as a skinny nigger I ate oversized beef
R.O.C. Yes, the number one clique here
If you represent us, throw them diamonds YES
Now that you know, holla to your boy
HOV '.. (Hov', Hov ', Hov')
(Hov ', Hov', Hov ', Hov')
Dig a hole, bury yourself, nigga!
Ahead! Keep going'!

The incomparable H.O
There's nothing left to accomplish, I went out and beat (Come, beat)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
I'm still here, mon frere!
Be the cross that I carry
They like: "That's why they call you Hov"
I'm like "yes"
Will not tear a handkerchief, no tears, no handkerchiefs, not a problem
Do not Cry for Me
I have a front row seat even if you don't speak
Silent partner, I hear you loud and clear
I'm just waiting until you dig a hole big enough to fit your whole body
Then I will body
It's just a hobby for him.
Simple as a volley service for him
Niggas says "Hov ', why don't you get on with the old man?"
Why kill a puppet and leave Geppetto alive?
Why not wait to catch them all together?
I told you to get money when you see a boss coming (Yes)
To think the shit was funny, but look what you see now (What do you see now?)
There's nothing left to accomplish, I went out and beat (Come, beat)
And now what are you talking about? Let's see now (Let's see now)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)

How do I dislike blacks?
I made it possible
For niggas to make history
How is this possible?
Please explain this shit to me
Like is logic?
He is like the disciples, despising Jesus and becoming his rivals.
Avoiding the only thing they owe their lives to
Do you think I'm in the office, am I out of my routine?
This is how children become orphans
Lost your mind
I keep my enemies close
I give them enough rope
They got up in the air
I just kicked the chair
I told you to get money when you see a boss coming (Yes)
To think the shit was funny, but look what you see now (What do you see now?)
And now what are you talking about? Let's see now (Let's see now)
Dig a hole (go ahead)
Dig a hole (Muthafucka bury yourself)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
I will not catch you, I will not forget your little disrespect
No, daddy, he's going to spank you for that shit you said
It's hard to do when you have nothing to prove
Because even when you win, you finally lose
Real niggas like, "Why Hov talking to Dude?"
You sell low too, only the time you were plat
My chain was on your neck, that's a real fact
So I pray that it spills out of the booth
That's when niggas you'll be out of your truth
Niggas throwing Roc signs out of your Coupe
Don't look at Hov like he did something wrong to them.
Because he is on them
He only took what belonged to him
You niggas are playing checkers with Hov playing chess
This game is over, I don't know if they'll know
You in the hole
I told you to get money when you see a boss coming (Yes)
To think the shit was funny, but look what you see now (What do you see now?)
There's nothing left to accomplish, I went out and beat (Come, beat)
And now what are you talking about? Let's see now (Let's see now)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)

Dig a hole (Muthafucka bury yourself)
Dig a hole (Dig a hole)
Jay-Z: You don't have enough stamps in your passport to fuck with Young H.O
Ice Cube: Don Dada
Ice Cube: Papa Doc
Jay-Z: Show the kids how to do this
Ice Cube: You know me, Ice Cube
My life had yet to show its ugly face
Just a pretty facade, hey god it's me
Remember three thousand
The one who used to pray to be a rapper
His favorite rapper wasn't rapping until he heard me
I wasn't rapping until I heard something called Eric B
And Rakim has paid in full
Rap really pays in full
So crowded that the kids don't go to school
Hoping to be one of us.
Now the university looks thin, the product is hooking them
Before their brains fully develop, they are engulfed by the vision teller.
Television tells their vision.
Now it's hard for them to make decisions without feeling
Golden rule, you can't be silly
Well i studied a broad and she studied me again
And my course was tough
That was that, this is this, listen
Because all i say is
If thirty are the new twenty, thirty are the new twenty for them you roll too
While the girls constantly graduate
Nigga is standing in the corner, hating, debating
'Well, should I buy the new J's or the Kobe's?'
Hey, I'm a G-entleman, let's meet again
I'm andre benjamin
I used to let my pants fall off, don't give a shit
Baby boy, now I'm an adult
Baby boy, now I'm an adult

Now I have black cards, good credit and so on.
Baby boy, because I'm older, ha
You roll blunt, I smoke Cubans all day
You guys chase, I'm a direct sponsor
I like South Beach but I'm in St. Tropez
Everyone drinks Dom, but not Rose '
Hey, you're already shopping at the mall
My girl burning the Bergdorf house
Returning with Birkin bags
Your girl says, "What kind of bag is that?"
I'm from the era where blacks don't make fun
You're from the era where snitchin 'the shit
I am afraid of the future
Everyone respect the one who was shot, respect the shooter
Young boys gotta chill, thirty is the new twenty, nigga, I'm still so hot
Baby boy, now I'm an adult
I used to navigate the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I'm an adult
Yes we used to dance like this
Now we own the ball team, holla back
Now I have black cards, good credit and so on.
Baby boy, because I'm older, ha
Jay-Z, what can a young son of a bitch tell me?
About the LAPD, about the air we breathe
Nothing, nothing, zero, zero
Playground king, climb the monkey bars I built
Thirty are the new twenty, Phantom is the new Bentley
Nigga, don't tempt me, I'll bury you in Tempe (west side)
And if I catch a ghost rider, tie it to a tree, gasoline like the lighter
Burn you damn biter
Treat you like George Bush treats al-Qaeda
This is Guantanamo, I think I'm a hoe
I made the honor roll, mixed with Geronimo (Yay, yay)
Before you pass this microphone, learn to wipe your nose before wiping your ass
Ice Cube, the pyroclastic flow
I used to let my pants fall off, don't give a shit
Baby boy, now I'm an adult
I used to navigate the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I'm an adult
Now I have black cards, good credit and so on.
Baby boy, because I'm older, ha
Now you're tuned to the muh'fuckin 'grand (Jigga)
Turn up the music on the headphones (Jigga)
Tim, you can go and take your shoulder off, nigga
I got you, yeah, uhh
If you feel like a pimp
Nigga go and take your shoulders off
Ladies are pimps too, go take your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you so
Take that dirt off your shoulder
Trying to rush some things that go with the Porsche
I don't feel remorse, I feel my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grabbing my balls
The ladies said, they love me, from the stands they scream
All the ballers bounce, they like the way I lean on
But all scammers love it, just to see one of us do it
It came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight out of the block
As a runner, do you understand? Man I'm straight out of the block
If you feel like a pimp
Nigga go and take your shoulders off
Ladies are pimps too, go take your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you so
Take that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

Your friend Hov 'in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just picked up a watch, trying to get myself a Rover
Trying to stretch the coke, like a fighter, yes sir
Keep Heckler close, you know smokers will test you
But, like, 52 cards came out, I'm not trying anymore
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel them
Now 52 cars are deployed, remove the roof
With a boss, bitch of course S.C. up your sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on screen
I paid for the jeans, plus the sneakers are clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a real adult
If you feel like a pimp
Nigga go and take your shoulders off
Ladies are pimps too, go take your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you so
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, back to the map
Me and my beautiful bee itch on the back of that 'Bach
I'm the most real to run it, it just happens that I rap
I don't have to applaud them, blacks are afraid of that black
I drop that black album, then I take it back
From bricks to billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to Opposite of Orphan Annie
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey '
I'm a scammer, friend, you're a client friend
I have some dirt on my shoulder; Could you brush it for me
Ladies are pimps too, go take your shoulders off
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
Now you're tuned to the damn bigger
Best live rapper, best live rapper
The nerve with you herbs
Everyone knows who strayed from the sidewalk
On the L-e-x - the best - note:
Fuck what you heard: splashes, splurges
Champagne glasses crash, can't ration
You had a fifty dollar while you were still taking Skippy to school
He ran with one of those niggas who steals from Tiffany for her jewelry
When Duke was jumping out of the Cap'n Crunch meal
I was hatching and hatching
Mainly dreaming a lot but look what it got me
4 cars and 400 thousand shots later, fucked in crocodiles
You're afraid to look, niggas is shaken
Fuck they are vibrators
Bullets are cracked when niggas try to rape us
FBI spies hate us, all they have to check is my
Last cut and then follow my movements: I'm the best
Fuck how the enemies have been paying dues
I cheated, committed serious crimes when necessary
While you niggas starve, what are you doing?
If you were rushing like you said
We'd hit heads, so I know you niggas are faking

Do I say that I sound like them? Hell no
Push the wigs back, push the Bentley drops that are yellow
It started from the elbow, nigga, from the first moment
No, not the Geico, it's nothing accidental
Just the facts that I've been through
Half the shit I've been through
That would make your pen move
Your mind would open, your heart would bleed
You sound late to me!

Because when this shit comes out, we'll run into your house
When you are defeated, young punk?
Aren't you going to shoot?
Won't you throw in the towel? I'm better with the vowels
My vocabulary kills the dictionary.
Shit I'm heavy on the game
I'm not worried about anything
Last man standing
Blam-blamming the canyon
48 hours, it's Reggie Hammond
The Foal, Nick Nolte
My behavior is Humphrey Bogie
Baby I'm comfortable, cozy, my place solidified
Roc-a-bye baby, I sing you a lullaby
Shit, I'm wearing two Taurus, niggas, they call me Gemini
Although my birthday is a day before December 5
Arrows through your clothes, I will leave you affectionately
Don't destroy me nigga; black i am poetry
Look at my tune, my flow is a serious crime
Oh, I'm seventy years old, I'm in tune with the heavenly
Governing body - Verify, verify, see my destiny
I walk leaving four tracks
My book is smart
My faith of the unknown
What is rarely shown is the good part
As I said
They try to give them life, but they want to die
You won't listen
That will make him mad quickly, you won't listen
When you are defeated, young punk?
Won't you shoot
Won't you throw in the towel, will you stop running your mouth?
Because when this shit comes out, we'll run into your house
You do not know
When you are defeated, young punk?
Aren't you going to shoot?
Won't you throw in the towel? I'm better with the vowels
My vocabulary kills the dictionary.

Serena Altschul is here outside the criminal court

In New York City for the first day at the trial of
The State vs. Shawn Carter aka Jay-Z
Whatever the verdict in this trial may be
The effects will undoubtedly be felt worldwide.
Ayo, go ahead, before you know it
Or witness me killing the track
Testify until I spill the blow
Now they have me for traffic, mafia, crack audio
They call me a drug addict, a drug addict
I try to tell them that I'm where hope, man floats
Ghetto spokesperson
A bankrupt man approaching the bank with intention
To bury me under the cell, he touched me like the toasted man
The evidence comes from ninety-six
They say the world has not recovered from its solution
While they were usin 'cut, I was in another shit
He gave it to you raw and they discovered it
Today, the jury raised their eyebrows.
Hearing testimonies about my bad ways
Annex A: Reasonable doubt
They say this was the first thing that got people out
You can feel the tension growing here
As an unprecedented number of people have turned out
For what may be the judgment of the century
They call me a drug addict, a drug addict
Ghetto spokesperson
How do you label your drug brand?
Vol. 1 and spread it through the slums?
He gave it to the youth with utter contempt
And how could you turn around?
And it is true that you operate the criminal company
And you deny that you are responsible for the disappearance?
Of the registry executives, and you object?
Polygram of your distribution, and through your connections
Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan
And not to mention, his co-horts and minions
And we are not going to talk about Murder Inc
That only establishes a darker and deeper criminal bond.
The state seeks the maximum sentence
And with the overwhelming amount of evidence
The D.A. is presented, things do not look good
They call me a drug addict, a drug addict
Ghetto spokesperson
The rapper is known to have emerged triumphant
In the face of adversity
They call me a drug addict, a drug addict
I try to tell them that I'm where hope floats man
Ghetto spokesperson
Before saying a word, I made sure my throat was clear
A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstances
Fragile nigga, I couldn't do much work with my hands
But my mind was strong, I grew up where you keep your niggas
Catch us, hope we don't collect gats
Where you drop your cracks on Mack trucks
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors.
Keep us spiraling, going backwards
Blindfolded, he is expected to walk in a straight line
Molded mind, taught to love and hate mine
Your honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine
Mumia's soul in these modern times
While the jury is inside deliberating
They call me a drug addict, a drug addict
I try to tell them that I'm where hope, man floats
Ghetto spokesperson
Well, the verdict has just been announced: NOT GUILTY!
It's a complete pandemonium here!
People are cheering and hugging - there he is
Jay-Z is leaving the room now
There is a swarm of cameras surrounding him {* flickering bulbs *}
And people just run to him
Let's try to get there, Jay-Z! Jay Z!
{* camera sounds keep flashing *}
"This is the operator with a collect call from: 'Emory Jones'
Emory, what's up?
I told you I'm not too good at writing letters and everything
Shit, I don't even write rhymes
I'm going to send you this open scribe through the waves
Vibrate with me ...
I said "we" because I'm here, you here!
Cigarette cans, yachts, there's nowhere we can't go
We in South Beach and the Hamptons too, baby!
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know i know
Do you want to ride with me?
Do you want to ride with me?
An experiment, we are in it, only as objects
And dodge the cops on the way to the top, yeah!
As children we dreamed sitting on our steps
Pointing at cars like, that's our sex
Hustlers earnings made us stretch our eyes
So, about some things from Dr. Spock, we start our walk
Some of us did, most of us rambled on
We show success, please live through me
(This is a collect call) So every time I press 5
Up on the food, and still holding her head
So when he goes out, he is going to eat this bread
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know i know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do you want to ride with me?
Do you want to ride with me?
I'm crushing all the prizes
All that shit we talked about
Giving them Sinatra pink rings with blue diamonds and all
Hehehe, that's what we're talking about, right?
Uh-huh ... I tried to tell you, travel with me
International Hov, I told you
40/40 in Tokyo
Singapore, all this singing songs
Although we think about throwing crude
It was the end of all being rich, wasn't it?
Little did I know about my most powerful delivery
He would give me up, king of the ink pen
Monster of double meaning, Coca-Cola is still my sponsor
Hova still takes it with soda
Diet, no sir, I don't lose weight
Started from the boxes now I'm sitting on a complete case
Since they have you sitting in that old case
Our dreams are waiting like TiVo
So I can't wait until you have your date
I have some temporary plates outside the door
Let's ride
I know i know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know i know
Do you want to ride with me?
Do you want to ride with me?
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Geah
However, don't worry about it, you won't miss nuttin
Just get better, now they have the Maybach Coupe
It looks like the Batmobile, the Ghost, the top just comes out of that joint
They caught your body, they can't catch your mind
Keep your spirit alive read your books
In fact, let me take you somewhere
Vibrate with me come on
Now me and my little mom, Quita and Ty-Ty
Juan and Dez in Saint-Tropez
You know Mary J., don't give you any more drama
I lost a couple of friends, all this shit got weird
I put on my niggas, my niggas put on their niggas
Now we are all in some foreign place, relaxing, drinking something
I will not forget you cousin, heh
Yes, black, everyone can wear sneakers on the beach if they want
You all niggas come and go, playing money marathon
My young man is LeBron, you know what he does to me, baby
Big Homie! Hehe, Emory, what's up?
I know i know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
I know i know
Some places we can go, some places we can go
Do you want to ride with me?
Do you want to travel with us? You are more than welcome
We're not in any shit, uhh
Roll me something man
Let me calm down with this shit here
Uh-huh, yeah
Uh-huh, white paper though black
I can't even fuck with those blunt
Baby white paper, nigga old school give me a joint
Alisa, young H.O.
Word to my mom, we are living!
Yes
I am where dreaming is not allowed
Enough to dream your self-esteem in clouds
Tears, sweat, blood needed, 5 CC
Because I know what a boy in apartment 5C saw
Speed datin 'with fate, I couldn't tell you no
When I first saw the stars, television was my telescope.
I threw diamonds into the sky that never fell, now it's a star
My vision was big enough to get me out of space.
I wanted to pass how far I see
Because the things you see are tempered
Roc Nation, indivisible
American dream team
Paper planes turned into something real
You are what you say you are
Change any situation
WHO. Are. You?
It turns around me
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Drop, drop, like it's hot
Spin around mommy
Drop, drop, like it's hot
I have the rollie on my arm
And I'm pouring saun dan
And I roll the best grass
Because I have it running
Chef boy-ar-P is back in the kitchen
You niggas is scratchin, my niggas are itchen
Don't stick with "Pacin", but these guys explode like "Pistons"
None of you are fucking with him, and this is obvious
While my niggas on the street push shit like Ben Wallace
And anyone who can get it, even fans in the stands
Is everything great? Nothing is little
Safety behind me, with the torpedo.
Because the doll freezes
How do you say it Frio
And the ends also a quarter of a million for each wheel
I have enemies in my jiz-ock, besides the damn ciz-ops
Everyone who wants to hit me with shiz-ots until dri-zop
Thank god for hip hop, or I'll be at the bizz-ox, uh
But now I'm so cool that you could smell me through a ziplock
Mr. S. D-izz-ot, it won't be stizz-op
Too much dynamism for these pesky niggas to get through
Too cool for the ciz-ops to handcuff her ass
These niggas give out cases like a liquor store
All the money he made, I'm like "Forget the law"
I'm not 'fr-iz-aid, it's J-iz-ay friend, you have pl-iz-ayed
Take it like a man, the flow made you get out of the routine (sit down)
Wasting your time trying to sue S. Dot, tell your lawyer
"Take that civil case and leave it like it's hot!"
((Around the world))
International, no, I'm universal
But you're a gangsta, how do you get to comment?
With them big wheels, yes because you do it big
I never pretend funk, niggas know I'm not a punk
Do you want beef? Yes because, open the trunk
We go all the way, we make it life size
Now my life is fine, because my wife is on my right side
Yes, and she protects my interest.
A pimp apprentice
Now come princess (come here, come here)
It doesn't really matter, it's like a rocker plate
I check money, I check niggas, I check bitches
me
Is it so difficult for me?
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Why do I keep running away?
Look, I apologize, often a womanizer
Took the birth of my son, look through the eyes of a woman
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
It took too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you in Paris
"Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!"
That was my proposal for us to be stable
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
Then i apologize
I still cry this death and
I apologize for all the stillborn because I was not present
Your body would not accept it
Because I was emotionless
And I apologize because in your best moment you are love
And because I don't follow what I'm saying, I'm all about
Your eyes go with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare into space
Thinking of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
Then i apologize
I will never treat you
I will never treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh
And all this ratchet shit and we're more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with your back turned
We are supposed to laugh until our hearts stop
And then they find themselves in a space where the darkness stops
And let love light the way
Like men before me, I cut my nose to screw my face
Something about me you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't take it
I'm disgusted in love, I think I need to redo
I will be emotionally available if I invite you
I stretch, what if you go over my shit?
I will never treat you
Ohhhhhh
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they don't look at me the same
I would probably die with all the shame
"You did what with whom?"
What use is a ménage à trois when you have a soul mate?
"Did you risk that for Blue?"
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask is gone and Santa Claus is fake
And you connect and you see
Let's try this, guru
(Every time I think of you) yes yes
(I feel so alive)
(Wish I could hold on to you forever)
This is how I start my day again
Uhh, uh huh, uh huh, yeah, uhh
(I woke up early this morning with a new vision of life)
Good morning America, ghetto USA
(Never read the Koran or the Islamic scriptures
Only the psalms I read were in the arms of my niggas)
Uhh come on good morning
(The sun was shining, you were on my mind)
Yeah i wake up i hit my shoebox rip some rocks
Put the rest inside, now I'm ready to ride
Put the bomb in my socks so the police can't locate the vials
I'm not freshly dressed, but I do have a Colgate smile
That's right ha
(I woke up early this morning)
I have a lot of capers to make this article
Hit the block like a veteran
Demons need medicine, I am the relief launcher
Your hitters clean, it works
I get to the avenue, I keep the bag on the ground
Put the rest in my little pocket, I start recording
(I woke up early this morning)
The same routine: I'm running the game to the demons
Trading cash for crack rocks, back and forth to my box
Hundreds of dollars a week
Shorties got the avenue watched, demons swarm
I'm getting rid of this bomb, like me
(I woke up early this morning with a new vision of life)
(Never read the Koran or the Islamic scriptures
(The sun was shining, you were on my mind)
(I woke up early this morning ...)
Yes
Yes
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be a hood forever
I am the new Sinatra, and since I got here
I can do it anywhere, yeah they love me everywhere
I used to be a policeman in Harlem - hello my Dominicans
I took it to my hideout, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons cupcake
Across 8th Street, off-white Lexus
He drives very slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out of that Bed-Stuy, home of that Biggie boy
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my kids with me
Say what about Ty Ty, still drinking Mai Tais
Sitting next to the court, Knicks and Nets hit me those five
Nigga, they'll drive me crazy, I could trip a referee
Say by my attitude that I'm definitely from
Concrete jungle (yeah) where dreams are made
There's nothing you can't do (yeah) (okay)
Now you're in New York (uh-huh, uh-huh) (uh, yeah)
These streets will make you feel like new (new)
The big lights will inspire you (come on) (okay)
Let's hear it for New York (You're welcome, OG) (come on)
New York (yeah), New York (uh) (I made you hot, nigga)
Catch me on the X with OG in a Yankees game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know that I bleed Blue, but I'm not a Crip, though
Shit from Afrika Bambaataa, home of hip-hop
For foreigners it is not fair, they act as if they have forgotten how to add
Eight million naked stories
City it's a shame half of you don't make it
Me? I have to plug in special Ed "I got it done"
If Jeezy pays LeBron, I pay Dwyane Wade
Three Cee Lo dice, three Monte cards
Labor Day Parade - rest in peace, Bob Marley
Long live the king, I am from the Empire State, that's
In New York (ayy) (uh, yeah)
There's nothing you can't do (that boy is good) (okay)
Now you're in new york (uh yeah)
(Welcome to the bright light, baby)
These streets will make you feel like new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it in New York (come on)
New York (yes), New York (uh)
The lights are blinding, girls need blinders
Aligned with casualties who drink life casually
Then gradually it gets worse: don't bite into the apple, Eva!
Stuck in the crowd, now you're in fashion
And when winter gets cold, fashionable with the skin off
The city of sin is a penalty on a whim
Good girls get bad, the city is full of them
Mommy, took a bus ride, now pulled out her bust
I came here for school, graduated to high life
MDMA made you feel like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slide an Ambien
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
These streets will make you feel like new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it in New York (come on)
A hand in the air for the big city.
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
There is no place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everyone says
In New York (uh, yeah)
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do (okay)
Now you're in new york (uh yeah)
These streets will make you feel like new
Big lights will inspire you (okay)
Let's hear it in New York (come on)
New York (yes), New York (uh)
It's brooklyn in the house
Yes
Yes i'm out of brooklyn now i'm in tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be a hood forever
I am the new Sinatra, and since I got here
I can do it anywhere, yeah they love me everywhere
I used to be a policeman in Harlem - hello my Dominicans
Right on Broadway, it brought me back to that McDonald's
I took it to my hideout, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons cupcake
Me? I'm out of that Bed-Stuy, home of that Biggie boy
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my kids with me
Say what about Ty Ty, still drinking Mai Tais
Sitting next to the court, Knicks and Nets hit me those five
Nigga, they'll drive me crazy, I could trip a referee
Say by my attitude that I am definitely
In New York yes
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of each other
These streets will make you feel like new
Big lights will inspire you!
Let's hear it in New York
New York, New York
Catch me on the X with OG in a Yankees game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know that I bleed Blue, but I'm not a Crip, though
But I have a gang of nations walking with my clique
Shit from Afrika Bambaataa, home of hip-hop
Yellow taxi, gypsy taxi, dollar taxi, holla back
For foreigners it is not fair, they act as if they have forgotten how to add
Eight million naked stories
City it's a shame half of you don't make it
Me? I have to plug in special Ed "I got it done"
If Jeezy pays LeBron, (I pay Dwyane Wade)
Labor Day Parade - rest in peace, Bob Marley
Long live the king, I am from the Empire State ...
In New York Sing now!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made
There is nothing you cannot do.
You're in New York now. Feel so special tonight!
Big lights will inspire you!
Let's hear it in New York
New York, New York
The lights are blinding, girls need blinders
To help them get out of bounds quickly, the sidelines are
Aligned with casualties who drink life casually
Then gradually it gets worse: don't bite into the apple, Eva!
Stuck in the crowd, now you're in fashion
And when winter gets cold, fashionable with the skin off
The city of sin is a penalty on a whim
Mommy took a bus ride, now she pulled out her bust
They all ride it, like a bus route
"Ave Maria" to the city, you are a virgin
I came here for school, graduated to high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicts to the limelight.
MDMA made you feel like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slide an Ambien
In New York Yes! <. B>
There is nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York. That's correct!
These streets will make you feel completely new!
Let's hear it in New York
New York, New York Hands up!
A hand in the air for the big city.
Street lights, big dreams, everything looks nice Yes!

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of Sing!

These streets will make you feel like new!
The great lights will inspire you!
Let's hear it in New York
New York, New York
Thank you thank you thank you!
Now can I get a bis? Do you want more?
Cooking raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for the last time I need you all to roar
Now what the hell are you waiting for?
After me there will be no more
So for the last time, nigga, make noise!
Who do you know cooler than Hov '? Guess what
The rest of you know where I am lyrically
Can neither of you reflect on me?
Yeah, listening to me rap is like listening to G Rap at its best
I'm Young H-O, Grateful Dead of rap
I'm on Boeing planes, Global Express
Out of the country, but the blueberry still connects
Low, but the yacht has a triple deck
But when you're young, what the fuck do you expect? Yes Yes
Big opening, big closing
Who are you going to find better than him?
No pen, just get inspired
You will soon see that you cannot replace it
So for the last time I need you all to roar
Now what the hell are you waiting for?
(* Sighs *) Look what you made me do! Look what I did for you!
I knew that if I paid my dues, how would they pay you?
When you first enter the game, they try to play with you
Then you drop a couple of punches, watch them greet you
From Marcy to Madison Square
The only thing that matters in a matter of years (yeah)
To be at your highest point, the perfect time to say goodbye
Using the 4-5, it's not playing games with you
It's aiming at you, probably mutilating you
Motherfucker, grab one for your team!
I came, look, you conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream until your lungs hurt
Owww, it's time for the stars
This man is bad, he's killing all the turkeys
Do you want more of the Jigga man?
So I need you all to help me get you back on stage
Are they out there? [crowd sings "HO-GO! HO-GO!"]
Come on, stronger!
Yeah now look at that i'm talking about
I like how this feels
(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)
Yeah [the crowd keeps singing] okay
This is the return of victory.
After a year of 16, it's 1.2
And that's 2.4, and I'm only doing two
I can get you BET and TRL too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well fuck it I'm not moving
Young did it to death, you have to love him
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all full of stars
Golfer above average as I put it
All because the shit I uttered was completely ridiculous
How sick is this?
You wanna hit, send Kanye change
Send just a little powder, send Hip a squeeze
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
You have to, you have to be fine, you have to light a J
You have to inflate a J in this [inhale]
You have to drink Crist-ALL
Buy some red wine, some Gaja 9-7
Have my baby, let's do it
Sorry; What's your name?
Because I see some ladies tonight
That should hang with Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to jog, ma'am!
Excuse me miss, what's your name?
Can you come hang out with me (Ooh, oh)
Possibly, can I get you out tonight?
You know what he's hitting for
50/50 adventure with them S Dots kickin 'off
Armadale explodes now, just bring one more nigga
The only thing missing is a lady
You don't even have to do the dishes, you have two dishwashers
I have a chef, a maid, all I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards held high, EVERYONE IS TRUSTING
Who else are you going to run with? The truth is us
Only guys moving units: Em, Pimp Juice and us
It's the Roc here!
Maybach outside, he has stones in his ears
I don't land at an airport, I call it the clear port
Therefore, I don't want to hear any more.
Back and forth about who is as sexy as Young, holla!
Sexcuse me ... damn it!
You are so contagious, I can't bear it
Have my baby, let's do it
You have to inflate a J to this
You are so contagious, I can't bear it
Have my baby, let's do it
Because I see some ladies tonight
That should be shooting with Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to jog, ma'am, what's your name?
Because I see some ladies tonight
You are such a cunning girl ... you are so hot to jog
He doesn't have them as a wife, he spends them one night! "
Now she doesn't like it, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let them
He doesn't need them, so he treats them like he treats them.
Better them than me, she does not agree with him.
She is mad at that, he doesn't have that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
With a flashy nigga bragging about the song
She glimpses Shawn and likes that
He bends her, so she responds
Smiling faces after all your sentences
Either she's the one or I'm stuck in The Matrix
Red or green pill, you live and learn, come on!
Sex-cuse me, damn it!
You have to put your fine linens for this
You are so contagious, I can't bear it
Have my baby, let's do it
You could go, you should go get something from Scooby Doo
Lady
I have to shoot Scooby Doo; those are shoes by the way
I have to shoot Scooby Doo, hehehehe
Have my baby, let's do it
Sorry; What's your name?
This for adults and sexy, only for adults and sexy
Court!
You are such a cunning girl ... you are so hot to jog
Love, come on half-son, I know my past is not one
You can easily pass, but that chapter is done
... but I'm done reading for now
Remember the swords face up, can you believe it for now
But you have a really serious role
But before you jump out the window, what's your name?
Sex-cuse me, damn it!
You are so contagious, I can't bear it
Have my baby, let's do it
Sorry; What's your name?
So hot to jog, ma'am! What's your name?
You are so cunning, you are so hot to jog

I thought it would be simple, I will only help you with your demo
Help them to the limo, play the instrumental instruments
And she - grabbed my tattoo, spied on my credentials
And she - grabbed my pants, felt the potential
And I rubbed each essential item
Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millennium
And I got a good powder and filled it with a bunch of Henney

Keep your arm over your face my nigga (keep your head)
Have a mind to survive if you sleep dead
Keep flying until you die black with prayer
With every word you say, I guess the meat is dead
Ladies and gentlemen (how to remove the Prez)
Val Kilmer-style nigga draws heat with the feds
Broad day as De Niro shoots all day
Take a hit I, step, explode, spit
With one in the fall, don't hit you
See you in the square with one in the camera
Face off, black
This goes for my Brooklyn team
Put your weapons in the air if you feel me
(If you feel me) Fuck them all day, fuck them all night
We don't love these hoes
This goes for my Brooklyn team
Put your weapons in the air if you feel me
(If you feel me) Fuck them all day, fuck them all night
This goes for my Brooklyn team
Raise your weapons (in the air) if you feel me
Fuck all day (fuck all night)
We don't love these hoes
This goes off ... put your weapons in the air
Fuck all day, fuck all night
We don't love these hoes
Yes!
This is going (to my Brooklyn team)
I know I should have done that
I know it will come back
I know it will destroy everything I did
He's probably going to send your boy away
But this game that I play, there's no way to fix it
It is inevitable that I am ... (falling)
When I hit a brick, then the game I would leave with
I got to a brick and then I looked at the sky like:
I have two bricks, new cars, new whips
But niggas never learn until they end up in the news clip
New convertibles, I'm so ruthless
Fight night in the front row, look how big my tube is
Fuck HD, nigga, do you see how clear my view is?
But there is a price to exaggerate
Also, the FBI guys with the cameras in the back.
I know I should have done that
I know it will come back
I know it will destroy everything I did
But this game that I play, there's no way to fix it
It is inevitable (now already) to fall
When you should have regressed
Now you (falling), right in her lap
Falling, clapping, screaming at the screen
Damn you screwed up like your favorite movie scene
Godfather, Goodfellas, Scarface, Casino
You saw what that last race did to De Niro in Heat
I can't beat the odds, I can't fool the gods
Can't fly too hard, life is a deck of cards
In a low voice as if you knew that this day would come (falling)
Now let's pray for that sweet arm
That you left your ex to stay down and be useful
Because in January it's cold, when the letters start to drop
And your commissioner is low and the lawyers scream appeal
Just thinking about an invoice and your chances are nil
Damn, gravity is sick ...
I know I should have done that
I know it will come back
I know it will destroy everything I did
He's probably going to send your boy away
But this game that I play, there's no way to fix it
It is inevitable (but already) to fall
And you can't get up
All you do is do push-ups, push-ups, sit-ups
Locked up, the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there?
And your sweet arm over them
And the women you left behind for this heifer
I have a college degree to come
Bad news keeps coming, it's hard to keep something in your stomach
You're sick of what your life is becoming (falling)
But your usual, has-beens, mistreating all the new guys
Talking hard on YouTube about what you used to do
But that's old school for the new crew
They make numbers like Sudoku
They will also experience déja vu
Run and you will never escape, so just fall out of favor
Curse...
I know I should have done that
I know it will come back
I know it will destroy everything I did
He's probably going to send your boy away
But this game that I play, there's no way to fix it
It is inevitable that I am
Falling, it seems I'm falling
Falling, it seems I'm falling
Falling, it seems I'm falling
Falling, it seems I'm falling
Falling, it seems I'm falling
Falling, it seems I'm falling
Falling, it seems I'm falling
(Hahaha)
This is how it feels, raise your voice (Ja-ya)
Raise my voice a little more
Raise my voice, Guru! (Ha-ya)
My wife in the crib feeding the children with liquid gold
We in a completely different way
I cooked more chicken when the kitchen closed
Uh, let's hit a billi first
Alhamdulillah, I check them all
Hovi's house, all these fakes stop
All this old talk left me confused
Would you rather be old rich or new you?
Since 2Pac doesn't have a nose ring too, huh?
No one wins when the family fights
But my hiding place doesn't fit in Steve Harvey's suit
I am clear why I am here, and you?
There's no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute
(Mmmmm) pretty
If someone receives attractive checks, it should be us
Fuck rap, crack cocaine
One hundred percent black champagne
And happily happily eating from these currents
They still drink Perrier-Jouët, ha
But we haven't contacted you yet, huh
'Especially if they're the same shade as you
They all stop me when I stop telling the truth
Hahahaha (Ha-ya)
I would say I'm the nigga most real rappin '(Ha-ya)
That's like saying I'm the tallest dwarf (Ja-ya)
Can I get "Amen" from the congregation?
Amen, amen (Ja-ya)
Can I get an "Amen" from the congregation?
Amen, amen (Ja-ya)
Ha-ya-ya-ya
Yeah i'm gonna fuck something good if you leave me
A man who does not take care of his family cannot be rich
I'll see Godfather, I miss all that shit
My conscience was Michael's common sense.
I missed the karma that came as a consequence
Niggas bustin 'through the curtains cuz she hurts
Kay loses babies because her future is uncertain
No one wins when the family fights
We all screwed because we never had the tools
I'm trying to fix you
I'm trying to make these black no stripe official
You guys think small, I think Biggie
The whole pass is in jeopardy, ten Mississippi
Al Sharpton in the mirror taking selfies
How is he or Pill Cosby supposed to help me?
Old niggas never accepted me
New niggas is the reason I quit drinking Dos Equis
We all lose when the family fights
What is better than a billionaire? Two
Hahaha
I will be damned if I drink some Belvedere while Puff has CÎROC
Everyone needs to stop
(Ha-ya) Ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya
(Ha-ya) Ha-ya, ha-ya, ha-ya
Ha-ya-ya-ya
Hahaha
Love me like love

What .. '96 and forever
Rok-A-Blok, Roc-A-Fella
Yeah keep it more real than most
Marcy, Brooklyn ... yes
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex 'pushing up on the set
I'm sorry I feel how high you get from the bleach
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
Crystal is on ice, I like to toast, I keep pouring it
Bone crushers I keep very close, I have the ability for this
The cheapest clothes on my back, looking sick as shit
Illegitimate transactions because life is still a bitch, and then you die
But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Like diapers, they had nothing to live for like them, but seers.
Making sure every nigga stays rich inside my cipher
We paid the price to surround ourselves, success, they raised my microphone
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is tough
I hope fools choose to listen, I drop jewelry, I break it
These are the rules that I follow in my life, you have to love it
Jiggy-Jigga looking at a ravine in the joint
If all of you blacks aren't talking about big money, what's the point?
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex 'pushing up on the set
I'm sorry I feel how high you get from the bleach
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
Even if it's not sunny, hey, I'm not complaining
(Where do you disappear, son?) Keeping
I'm living, the sadness of the streets made you feel hungry
Nothing to gain and much to lose, you keep singing, fool
I'm thorough, in every city, my name is ringing
They can certainly attest that my life is real as shit
And all the cities like Cambridge I killed with, shit
And all the meticulous niggas I rush with
Throw your joints in the air once and pop your shit
These fake rappers really can't know that I love it, feel it?
Feeling it, feel the Lex 'pushing up on the set
I'm sorry I feel how high you get from the bleach
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex 'pushing up on the set
I'm sorry I feel how high you get from the bleach
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
What, you guys haven't heard that hot black Jay?
Crystals keep me wet like Baywatch
I hold it tight every night my mom prayed for me to stop
Said he had dreams of snipers hitting me with a deadly shot
Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you have
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they heat me up
You guys don't feel me enough to stop the disease, do you?
But at the same time, these pennies make me feel tight
I'm so confused, well, I'm getting discouraged now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's only once in blue when there's nothing to do
I get to the zoning: this girl and I on the island and then we got boned
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moan
Take one more chip and leave that weed alone, man
It started me up, shit
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex 'pushing up on the set
I'm sorry I feel how high you get from the bleach
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex 'pushing up on the set
I'm sorry I feel how high you get from the bleach
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët ...
Can i kick it (If you can)
Can i kick it (If you can)
(I am loving that)
Can i kick it (If you can)
Can i kick it (If you can)
Can i kick it (If you can)
WELL, I'VE GONE!
Debut is a classic, first album, four microphones
There should be a five, but niggas lacks foresight
But I don't give a shit, I don't do it for the hype
For the fight for those who bubble white
To fly 4x4, homeless cars, perfect ice
For every time it rains 40 days and 40 nights
For every promise made that never saw the light
I'll get my own forty acres, give me four nights
Four O's, a Glock 40 for the jackers and I'm Spike
Or the four and four will be enough
A fourteen year old boy to take care of the vice
You can sit and wait for the flight
Your boy will go like he's been stripping all my life
That's the kind of metaphors i write
To let niggas know it was real before the mic
First four rows, they had fur in the fight
Without PETA in my Peter, I left room for the divas
In the suite, we'll meet if you're crazy at night
In a rampage, the champagne spills, on the floor
For all those who did not arrive and lost their lives
Not without hoes, not without ice
Not for fame or bright lights
44 four, muh'fucka, I'm NICE
Check
I'm here
The man
I'm swinging, singing and bringing
The light to the mic
Again
Together forever
Effort, to always prevail
Good
I'm better
Compared
Jay-Z's embarrassing
Your time later
Riggity-rhyme master
Jay-Z's last rhyme ligature
So pro fade line
You have starch in your flow
I flow in many ways
I have a bow in my flow
All the songs are fluid
Rembrandt, Rilke
You have to forgive the flow
Niggas take me lightly
Had to obscure the flow
The way I put it together
Tear them with the current
I'm too smart with the flow
You just started to flow
Stop him young
You 106 and park with the current
Three million
Four
I am the used spirit
I'm with the flow
Troubled man, I dare say
I'm all with the flow
But I evolve with the flow
Crossover, slam dunk
Rucker Park with the Stream
Young!
The old school, the new school needs to know this, I burn like
Left eye Lisa López, burns slowly like blunt hydro
Jigga Man, shit BK, everyone knows it
Jigga Man, you heard, the fugitive lets me spit on this track shit
Let me thank people for all their support and prayers.
And all the people who prejudge me, fuck you, suck my dick
GIVES. act like a starving black man for Jay if they lock me up in a cage
Fuck it, party, I'm still hot, I'm still S dot you
I still have millions buried in the sock drawer
Still holdin 'mine in the nigga corner
What can't kill me can only make me stronger black
And when I get back home get your butt off the throne
It's going back to the way shit was
I'll stay warm no matter what my shit does
I could drop a mess, I'll stay up niggas tryin 'to break my will
You know it's not my steel, I'm Destiny's Child, my destiny has been sealed
You're dealing with a higher power, I'm like Dwight Eisenhower
As my world spins like the wheels of a bicycle spoke
All they see is money, they want me to blind the jury.
Does the sun shine brightly?
Now everyone wants to rhyme like Hov because I rhyme
Like he's rhyming on the Rov 'climbing' on his hoes
My mind likes diamonds, I'll blind you to the shows
I don't shine, shine, I remind you of that mass, right?
Killer niggas, right?
My character, Hustler turned rapper, smells the aroma of crack
Send photos as you take in any language
Leave the niggas in a coma when I'm hitting that Fifth
Light the chicks from Crowns and bamboos
And make the camcorder connect your hand movements
And for what? They are acting like you better than Hov '
You all niggas should open up for the Letterman show
Niggas it's funny, all I do is get money
And you all niggas sound funny to me, you all rap
Like they're better than Hov ', but that's really funny to me.
Look around you all the platinum, the proof is proof
But I'm going to let the blacks live 'cause it's beautiful
Live niggas
Jigga Man, did you hear? Hard Track
When I'm alone in my room, sometimes I stare at the wall
But deep in my mine I hear my call to conscience
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
So if you ran out of love, I suggest you get over it
Ma Cry Me A River Build a bridge and get over it
They love it when I'm hard on hoes
I agree, my lady is not a bitch, she gets whatever I have
So when you see I understand it's me, nigga
I understand that I'm still the same OG Nigga
* NO LETTERS YET
Shit, you know what to do
Cousin, Cold Crush when I give it to you
Friend or foe, me, declare your business
Ummm, do you take care of dough? Ah there it is.
Me, I run the show, oh, and these kids don't like anyone coming around here fucking dough for shit.
But fuck with the big dogs, I gotta bite you
Look, it's out of my hands
And you get 'money' around here, it's not in the plans
So get out of that truck and go back to Kansas
I'm sending niggas back to campus
Probability is slimmer than that girl in Calvin Klein pants
Let me guess, they said it was money around here
And the rest is that I'm preventing you from understanding, correct?
I'm sorry to hear that, I guess you have a job at the hotel
I'll take care of that, you'll see soon
You're shaking, don't do that, you're making me nervous
My crew, well, they pack, those guys are killers
So please, would you put your hand out again?
They don't like to see me nervous, you can understand that, right?
You draw, I better know Picasso, you know, the best
Because if this is not so, ah, God bless you
You leave me no choice, I will not leave you a voice
Believe me son
Now reassure your boys
Cause I'm finding it a little hard to focus with all the noise
Get the point, I'll let you go; before you leave
And a promise that never, no matter the weather
Ever ever ever ever came around here no mo 'ha ha ha
Uh-huh uh, the saga continues ...
Shit movie
Ran on the spot smoking gun
He shot in the air, one woke him up
Drenched son, sweating on his bed like Dun 'Loc'in!
Thinking of himself what caused him
His thoughts run like a vulcano
Finally he realized who was to blame.
I said yes, remind me of friend or foe when
I told you never to come back here
Time to pay now, you try to get up, I wave the gun - lie down
I try to speak sensibly, hoping you finally realize
I had this blocked and it wasn't meant to be
Also, I had sympathy when we all bought tires with your keys
And it was an afterthought that maybe you'll try to avenge me
But I was like "Nah", Homes had to know I was wrong
And if you caught me missing now you sing the same song to me
You also promised
And that's not really fun
And here I find you in this Motel 6 with all these weapons
And all your thugs, lined up in adjoining rooms
Like some wild cowboys who come looking for me at noon
See how my eyes scan the room
I'm alert, plus I paid the employee.
Do you think you are the first black man to play in a city with two hotels?
Come on, I looked at your Lexus like you
Money well spent, rudely interrupted
Jamaican accent (Do you know who you fucked?)
A gun to your face and that's all you can think of?
And please tell BIG, he's amazing
BIOTCH friend or foe!
Original dancehall remix from Kingston Jamaica, Star Trak!
I would act indifferent in front of an audience
I'm too old to be in front when I feel like Denzel
And you act like you're not attractive when you're
I'm ready to stop when you are
Jay-Z, Marshall, Kartel and Pharrell Pha-real
Real ROC-A-Wear clothing
Girlfriend your friends and you full of sexual appeal
You have the best to feel the texture
Now my love for you in time will reveal
Keep it real with me and I'll keep it real you know
Because it's you that I really want to share my name, yes, my name
Hey, many girls come and go with exaggeration
For me it means more than just one night, I, one night
* Capitalized letters mean Wayne Marshall is singing with Pharrell
I know I keep going, no matter if I'm bragging
I was right in front (you know I love you baby)
I'm ready to bet everything, unless you don't give a damn
BUT YOU KNOW I WANT IT NOW (you should stop frontin baby)
Listen, and you'll hear wedding bells in my ear
If your girl fi mi illuminate my world fi mi
This is not comedy like Fresh Prince of Bel Air
I am serious when I say yuh seh my love and my care
Deh yah king size bed, wid di lino fits here
Don't be fooled by my shine and my girl of fame
Because it's you that I really want to share my name, yes, my name
Hey, many girls come and go with exaggeration
Watch the remix now !!!
Mek mi tells you something I need your mom

And even if you see my wid Donna
Just remember there is odda, wow!
Don't be fooled by my shine and my girl of fame
Hey, many girls come and go with exaggeration
For me it means more than just one night, I, one night
Oh girl I never wanted to say up front (I never wanted to say)
I know you probably think I'm drunk
You know we don't play stunts (directly)
I know you probably feel like I'm drunk
But you don't want any commitment, huh? (Uh-uh!)
Why not? You should come home with me
Sitting on this lap in luxury
Now yeah, you come home while I'm waking up (yeah!)
Acting how you behave and stuff

Yes, a lime to a lemon, my women V-A
Walk in Manolo Blahniks because my condo with elevators in them
So I sprayed it with gin and then we started to sin, uhh
Blasphemy, oh my god, every prayer
She keeps scratching me like I have a tiger in her
This is exactly why I had to hold her
Her man kept walking, stressing her
So I told her what to say in case he questioned her
(Situations will arise, but you must be smart about it)
No matter what you do, don't talk about us
Do not give information, it will be lost without it.
Just keep your mouth shut, we could do this again
Bring a friend!
You used to get all the attention, huh? (Yes!)
Why not? You should come home with me
Sitting on this lap in luxury

We do what we like to do and then we go out
But lately I've been having the strangest feelings
Your Young Hov boy 'catching feelings
And it's ruining my deals because mommy isn't willing
Said we had to connect and have fun

"A little over a year ago I was in slavery. And now I am back here, reaping the blessings and reaping the benefits that come with it. Everything that is here for kings like us. The reason we like this" These jewels and these diamonds and things "they don't understand, it's because we really are from Africa. And that's where all these things come from.

Take off in a Lamborghini Countach
200 on the board, let's speed it up (skirt)
Lucky Luciano is what they call me, paesano

Yes, Renegade is back.
Em, the rhythm is sick!
8 miles and running, I got my seventh album falling
And my eighth album is coming
Feeding a thousand stomachs growling
People said it wouldn't mean a thing
I had talent for nothing
He said he would either succumb to violence or be silenced by a gunman
Wanting something, claiming they did something for him
They got their Jay Z pom poms and their Hov uniform
And tell everyone like Martin Lawrence
'About how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was
Claiming they threw it up before I threw it up
What about you? Where were you before this exploded?
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everyone was hurting us
Back on the block, going in, there was nobody with us
And my eighth album is coming
Feeding a thousand stomachs, Free!
6 miles and running, I got my fifth strip exploding
And my first album comes, feeding twenty growling bellies
8 miles and running, I got my seventh album falling
And my eighth album is coming
6 miles and running, I got my fifth strip exploding
And my first album comes, feeding twenty growling bellies
6 miles and running in the Pontiac six thousand eighty-six
Trans could change while engine runs
Someone say their honor: "Give me one more chance."
So I bring you one
My dad's only son, stay close to my mom
My son grows up and learns a lot
That's when the toasters, when the burners explode
Brain in you, um-brella, nigga, tell 'em niggas
That's like biblical scripture
Most of your soulless and self-centered
Like Meshach and Mesha
The heat returns, like you never left
Six miles and running, dodging each trap
The gingerbread man rap
And my eighth album is coming
Feeding a thousand stomachs, Free!
6 miles and running, I got my fifth strip exploding
8 miles and running, I got my seventh album falling
And my eighth album is coming
Feeding a thousand stomachs, Free!
6 miles and running, I got my fifth strip exploding
And my first album comes, feeding twenty growling bellies
When no one would discover that he had talent
No one would sign me
No one believed in me, no one but mommy blindly
But how can she deny me? Me being the youngest
Revenge is sweet darling, we run this
Beans and Bleek is right now, we can see all of you 8 miles, nigga
Feeding a thousand stomachs, Free!
6 miles and running, I got my fifth strip exploding
And my first album comes, feeding twenty growling bellies
8 miles and running, I got my seventh album falling
And my eighth album is coming
Feeding a thousand stomachs, Free!
6 miles and running, I got my fifth strip exploding
And my first album comes, feeding twenty growling bellies
Just let me be cool
I feel like the damn Cassius Clay right now
Genius!
Don't be good, my nigga, be great
After that government cheese, we are eating meat
I'm from below, I know you can relate
Fuck the world
Just fuck this world
Fuck the world
Me and fate have a date
Martin had a dream, Hov got a team
My chain is already heavy, don't let me get a ring
Parades by Flatbush, confetti on my fur
Turn right on Red Hook, heavy niggas on the sidewalk
See, most of my blacks died in their early twenties or late teens
They still want to act like it's everyday, clean
Fuck this world
Fuck it, uhh
High inhabitant of the yellow sky and rose gold
He passed through Pasadena in the low-low
Just to show respect to cholos
I just want a photo to show my genius
Standing on top, hold my penis
America tried to castrate the greats
Malcolm murder, gave Cassius the shakes
Try to dim your lights and tell you to be humble
You know I'm gonna shine like a trillion watts
Sending light to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil bastard sunbathing on top
I shit in this world
Just fuck this world
Let's screw the world
Fuck it, uhh
He in a Cadillac; me? I'm at the Maybach
They are not gray suits and white stockings.
This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
I have strip clubs that feel like Oxford I swear
Teacher-teacher, I'm trying to teach you
All the shit they were taught, they put everyone in the stands
When you're in the front row in the Knicks game, those are the Spike Lees
You are in the front row everywhere, in the H.O.V.
Jordan 1's and overalls
Make a million, another million, let my niggas make a million
We still have to see a roof, we just beat what we beat
Because the bars do not fight and the fight does not stop
Just fuck this world
Uh
Everyone wants to take my life, then come find me
I'm so committed to life on the street, sometimes I don't sleep nights
Go back and live, because the fact of this is
I keep 0.44 in the sky, thinking about my money
Nigga, I'm so real, I hope you don't find this funny, no
Live every day as my last quick money
But pop's dick, mom's egg, hungry like a hostage
With every step I take I use my sense of the hood
Study my tracks, learn from my mistakes
I was born dead, darling, my life is all sauce
Reporting live from ROC, I represent my set
Until the date of my death, I will die for my block
I gotta take my shit off (get down, get down)
Take off your ass and catch up on that money
Live every day as the last, as death is fast approaching
Gotta get the shit off (shit! Get off, get off!)
Get off my ass and get my money
Gotta take my shit off (shit, shit, shit, shit!)
Live every day as my last ...
If there was heaven above us, he was living in hell
My neighborhood was the hardest, I never complained
Bush and Reagan couldn't stop me from doing
I wish I could dream of being a lawyer
But I had dealers in my hallway, death around the corner
Couldn't tell right from wrong, pimps will spoil you
I give you dollars to run errands when nobody was carin '
Gotta take my shit off, it sounded true every time
I heard it or every time someone was killed
We pour liquor on the sidewalk until the cement stain
I cried enough tears from my eyes to match the 3 inch rain
Motherfuckers, I deserve it when I'm in the Range
I copied them uncut stones that are freezing the chain
I've been through enough shit to make you pee in your pants
Man, I'm sorry if we're not seeing the same thing, I saw it rain
I gotta take my shit off (get down, get down)
Take off your ass and catch up on that money
I gotta take my shit off (get down, get down)
Gotta get the shit off (shit! Get off, get off!)
Get off my ass and get my money
Live every day as my last ...
That is why I give you my ups and downs, my pain, my passion, my pleasure.
My good and bad times, niggas, my whatever
My hopes and dreams, blood, tears and sweat.
My version of R. Kelly, this is the threat of a black
My life is an open book, black, I hope you have taken from it
Whatever works for you, I was put on this earth to move
But lately I've been smoking a lot, not counting my drinks
I have to take the shit off, I'm sure of that
Nigga, I'm clear, I've seen my closets bare
I heard money mentioned in my mother's prayer
I had nights my stomach was filled with nothing but air
We have 10 dollars to eat for 4 of us to share
That's why Hov 'acts like this, quick to break
Ready for MAC-11, I won't go back
Gotta get the shit off (shit! Get off, get off!)
Get off my ass and get my money
Gotta take my shit off (shit, shit, shit, shit!)
Sup ma? You want to shoot with us, you know what I'm saying?
It's good, it's love, everything is love
We have Belvedere cases, let's play the truth or the challenge
Let's really get to know each other
Knahmean? I'm here for you, me
Relax, let your conscience be free
Now you ride with them R-O-C thugs
Cross the Roc, get hot
The topic of discussion in all nail shops.
It's a secret society, all we ask for is trust
And in a week, watch your arm freeze
Right bra, A to D cup
Knit well, pedicure your feet up
From hoodrat to superstar, there is your life
Fuck Hova, he can get you out of your hell
Say goodbye to Reebok, say hi to Chanel
Say hi to Gucci, Prada too
Look in the mirror, be proud of yourself
Straighten your mind mommy, straighten your mind
You have to play your part when you're shooting with the R-O-C
Straighten your mind mommy, straighten your mind
Straighten your mind mommy, straighten your mind
I need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat
Straighten your mind mommy, straighten your mind
And I need gangsta girls, for my gangsta family
I'm young Memphis I used to be the apprentice
Now I'm like the teacher, come on, let me show you
How to play on benches, hold this job in your dentures
How to play well when the police come to pinch us
I'll teach you how to keep your nose out of my shit
When the alarm goes off, don't reach
As if you put a ring or spent cheese on Bleek
When I'm in the shower, * 69 crazy
Track my last call, contact my broad
With a bitch or two, I had physical contact at the mall
You have problems {* inhale *} problems that you need to solve
You have to play your part when you're shooting with the R-O-C
Come on little mom, come on
You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me
Straighten your mind mommy, straighten your mind
Come on little mom, come on
I need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat
Straighten your mind mommy, straighten your mind
Come on girl let's go
Straighten your mind mommy, straighten your mind
P-I-M-P-ology
I play you and you pay me
Believe me when I tell you girl, I know you a weirdo
Just be aware that you can go very far
I know times are tough on the boulevard
They say, pimpin 'is dead (what?), Man, pimpin' is not dead
These just scared and blind hoes try and die to be guided (Mm)
But who will lead them? Talk shit to them and hit them
Make them worry and feed them
Now I don't need them (Uh-uh), but I can do it there
I put on a three-piece suit and Shirley Temple combed my hair
So I can feel like a player when I walk the place
I got your bitch on my line, and now she's on my face
Is this your bitch? Is that your bitch? Because if it is not, she is mine
She's falling in love with a nigga and I haven't even dropped a line
Get out of my spotlight, bitch, and focus
Come on, little mom, come on (Come on, come on)
Straighten your mind bitch, straighten your mind
Come on baby, come on, come on (come on)
You have to play your part when you're shooting with the R-O-C
Straighten your mind mommy, straighten your mind
You gotta know what it takes to be down with a nigga like me
Straighten your mind ma, straighten your mind
I need a gangsta girl, who can ride in my passenger seat
Gotta have the right mind, baby, have the right mind
And I need gangsta girls for my gangsta family
Straighten your mind mommy, straighten your mind
Straighten your mind ma, straighten your mind huh?
Gotta have the right mind, baby, have the right mind
Jigga Man, Swizz Beatz
Lights off, ladies!
Come on baby, you drive me crazy (where are all my thugs baby?)
I don't want anyone but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Make me scream your name
Come on baby, you drive me crazy (where are all my thugs baby?)
I don't want anyone but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name
I took you out of Jacob in clusters
Busters wanted to rush us
I love the way you shine when the sun touches you
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is correct
You can light the whole room, changing the day of the night
With you around my neck we block the whole block (that's correct)
He took short sleeves and rest to understand
The reason they call you ice, they all freeze
There is no pendant in the sun that can shine like you
And that platinum in charm that can blind like you
The straight reason why niggas do crimes they do
I used to snatch the necklace from those reckless fools
I guess I was jealous that they were so close to you
So I spent half my time investing in you
The other half was spent protecting you
Because you belong to me, now sing your song for me
Come on
Come on baby, you drive me crazy (where are all my thugs baby?)
I don't want anyone but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Hold me tight and call me your lady (say it louder)
Make me scream your name
I don't want anyone but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name
I'm often with you, so they wonder about the juice I got
I took you out of the projects and an abusive pop
Bottom up
The skateboard until the fall
I have you as I have you
Since the first time I put you around my neck and locked you up
It was then that I knew where I was going that you would follow
I soon spent every dollar, you became my habit
The more checks I received, the more I tied my crew
Fooled a little bit, shit, I tie the boo
Damn, my lover, I tied her too
I copy my jewelry twice, as déjà vu
If they ever met at the mall, it all ended
Just like me, and you win anyway
I mean bullies love you when you're a girl's best friend
Come on baby, you drive me crazy (where are all my thugs baby?)
I don't want anyone but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Come on baby, you drive me crazy (where are all my thugs baby?)
I don't want anyone but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name
Yes Yes Yes
In the wedding band that you love, in the golden chain that you kill
And the tennis bracelet means they want relationships
You know they want to fuck, the only reason they leave you
In the hands of the gold diggers, it's never enough
Rings, things, are never enough
I mean thugs love you but your best friend
Come on here baby you drive me crazy
I don't want anyone but my baby
Come on baby, you drive me crazy (where are all my thugs baby?)
I don't want anyone but you my baby (and all my ladies sing)
Make me scream your name
Come on here baby you drive me crazy
I don't want anyone but my baby
Hold me tight and call me your lady
Make me scream your name

She gives me extra pillows and love on the back

I am not going to say that my nose cannot be open (it may never say never)
I love the girls, girls, girls, girls, girls that I adore
Put your number on this paper because I would love to go out with you
Hello to you when I go on tour
Who do you know, who do you want to be fucked with?
I have this smart art girl who I ask this question
I read a couple of books to add to the progression of his soul
To put this in the layman's term, I gave him a little knowledge
She gave me, brain in return, had to drop out of college
And she, call me "Professor", say that daddy come try it
I'm like, at this rate, ma, you never graduate
She said, I'm not stupid, I'll make it up in summer school
I love girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I adore
Hello to you when I go on tour
Now let the people sing
(I'm testing girls, I'm just trying girls)
Put your number on this paper because I would love to go out with you
Hello to you when I go on tour
Who do you love, who do you want to be fucked?
Got this model slash actress slash waitress part time
She spends all day, she hanging around with halftime enemies
All they do is wash the dirt and put a touch on my last
Itinerary, but as I tend to vary, see
I tend to carry more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
They tend to rush in ten places at once
Also, she can't cope, because look how I run the mines
Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
Our time apart is our time apart
So love Jay with your girl mind and not with your heart
Like the late Makaveli or Pirelli twenty inches
You tell the girls if they should know my business
(I'm testing girls, I'm just trying girls)
Put your number on this paper because I would love to go out with you
Hello to you when I go on tour
I'm trying girls, girls, girls, girls, girls, I adore
Put your number on this paper because I would love to go out with you
Hello to you when I go on tour
Big ghetto booty, scarf over her doobie
Chanel under Louie, Gucci over her booty
Pretty, witty, feminine, worldly
Who likes to party but get home early
Thin, a little thick, I swear I love you all
She can cook the coke and got hooked on the license
But she can get you first class seats at coach prices
Isn't that great My flight leaves at eight
(I'm testing girls, I'm just trying girls)
Hello to you when I go on tour
I'm trying girls, girls, girls, girls, girls that I adore
Put your number on this paper because I would love to go out with you
I'm not a girl's boy, and they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie and girls respect me for it
But right now there are too many fine ladies to choose one
I'm trying girls waiting patiently
I'm just trying girls, until I find one for myself
I'm not a girl's boy ... [real talk to you, peep game]
And the girls respect me for that [you have to respect that]
I'm not going to say that my nose can't be open [I may never say never]
But right now there are too many good ladies out there
To choose one of [too many ladies, ha]
I love girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls that I adore
Put your number on this paper because
I would love to go out with you
Hello to you when I go on tour
Whoo! Who do you love, who do you want to hug, heh
I have this smart art girl who I ask this question
I read a couple of books to add to the progression of his soul
To put this in simple terms, I gave you a little insight
She gave me, brain in return, had to drop out of college
Knowing that she does this task, I give her private lessons.
In and out I move through their student union and
Call her teacher, say daddy come try it
So she could purposely fail and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate, ma, you never graduate
She said, I'm not stupid, I make it up in summer school
Now let the people sing
I'm testing girls, [just treating girls] just treating girls
Put your number on this paper because I would love to go out with you
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quickly
I always had a P.H.D., a huge cock
Ladies tired of being scammed by guys like this
2 way or call me if you try to bone me
Your man has moe-nee, you still feel lonely
He claims he loves you, no doubt, it's Gwen Stef-phony
You are a fair-skinned girl, a dark-skinned Aaliyah
A black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto miss
You remind me of my Jeep, but not Kia
We can talk on my cell phone, but not on Nokia
Come in and out that's why I hardly hear you
I'm coming and going like a robbery
I am trying to take this money like Rob and G-dep
Then I'll take you to my house like Trick and Trina
And my penis is so big that it doesn't fit in my jeans
And a bitch so angry she can't get into my cream
And it gets so bad that she wants to break my things
But still, K-A-N-Y-E
She says she wants to go shopping
I bought him some cheap J.Lo jeans because the ass was free
I'm not a girl's boy, and they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie and girls respect me for it
I will not say my nose? can't finish
But right now there are too many fine ladies to choose one
I'm trying girls waiting patiently
I'm just trying girls, until I find one for myself
The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe the feeling, really
Baby I paint the blue sky
False alarms and false starts
All enhanced by the sound of your heart
All the pain from the last time
I prayed so much that it was the last time
Your mom said you danced for her
Did you shake your hands for her?
Glory! Glory!
Glory! I'm sorry
All i prayed for
God's gift, I wish I had prayed more
God doesn't make mistakes, I made some
Toboggan here and there, but I made it
I wreaked havoc on the world
Prepare for the second part
Younger, smarter, faster me
So a pinch of Hov, a whole glass of Bey
The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe the feeling, really
Baby I paint the blue sky
Your grandfather died of a black failure
Deep down he was a good man.
Damn, I can't deliver failure
Wicked lil b
Difficult not to spoil, rotten, looking like the little me
The most beautiful thing in the world
It's daddy's girl
And mom woke up the next day and shot her album package.
The last time abortion was so tragic
We were afraid you would disappear, but no, darling, you are magical (Voilà!)
So there you go, shit happens
Just make sure the plane you're traveling on is larger than your carry-on luggage
Life is a gift, love, open it
You are the son of my destiny
You're my son with Destiny's Child's son
That's a great recipe
Glory! Glory!
The most amazing feeling I feel
Words can't describe the feeling, really
Baby I paint the blue sky
* baby noises *
I've been crushing the building from Izod's socks
Maybe it won't stop
Police spots, seventy-six floors, you can call me the Doc |
Say when, say when
(When!)
Inspired by Basquiat, my car is on fire
They all took pictures, beat my body, I'm tired
Build me up, tear me down to build me up again
They like: "Hov, we need you back so we can kill your ass again."
How I'm perched to win, they got me fighting ghosts
The same sword with which they ride you will give you good night
Sh .. that's only half if they like you
That's not half of what they could do
Don't believe me, ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
You see Biggie, you see Pac, you see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas; see Caesar, see Brutus
Seeing success is like suicide
Suicide, it's suicide
If you are successful, prepare to be crucified
The media intrude, niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you of your ghetto
So it's hard to be Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you must be Bobby now
Now the question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having at all
Everybody wants to be the king, so the shots ring out
You lie on your balcony with holes in your sleep
Everybody take your hand off my jeans
Uhh! As if you worked hard to stay the same
Uhh! The game stays the same, the name changes
Most kings go so crazy
Who try to hit the same vein as Kurt Cobain
Safe, so cheeky
Invited to the inner sanctuary of their chambers.
Pull down the chains as the enemies get closer
And the spirit that I'm evoking
Wait
Everyone screaming they want old Hov
But the new hit Hov improved like Albert Pujols
Everyone wants to hear me talk about that money like Phil Rizzuto
But my mind is on Pluto.
Trying to find some loopholes in the IRS
Like where I used to have some hoes, I'm just
Concentrate on making a new Hov through sex
I woke up just in time for those fucking school
Trying to stay in my shoes with frozen jewelry
Better stick to this text before you go
Broke up, spending more than he has accumulated on silly baguettes
I know that fool begets fool, you will learn alone
At least my conscience is clear, I'm not mistaking you anymore
Bosses are courting me
Jimmy I's and Lyors-es - en
It has to be more than the choirs
They respect my mind now
It's only a matter of time now
Operation: corporate acquisition
Makeover offices-is-is and then take everything
Please let these words be recorded
To serve as a testimony that I saw it all before
It came to fruition, a kind of premonition
The scammer's uncontrollable ambition
Alias Superstition, as Stevie
The writing is on the wall like my lady, right baby?
Like a fox, I'm cautious, ah-ah
The more successful, the more stressful
The more and more I become Gordon Gekko
In the race to a billion my face to the ceiling
I have my knees on the floor please Lord forgive him
Have you lost your religion, will greed catch you?
You are having heaven on earth, will your wings still fit you?
I have the Forbes on the floor in my living room
And I keep talking to the poor, nigga, I want more
The most influential time, it was awesome
'Especially since I wasn't in the artists section
Had me with the builders and the titans
I had a good time with Rupert Murdoch
Billionaire boys and some guys you never heard of
The news on Madison Ave is that I'm a cash cow
Spread the word on Wall Street, buddy, get the money out
IPO Hov, no need for reverse merger
Boardroom I'm lifting your skirt
Smugglers, bombings, Bin Laden
I'm still crackin '
I will not lose, I just refuse
I show power
Dedicate hours
I live in the fight, I'm addicted to the hustle
America, this land of mine
It is full of prisoners, with the same plans as mine.
So I'm a walking contradiction
On the one hand, I love my position
But I could easily have been in that prison
And no, I'm not a Christian, although I believe in God
But I don't believe in the devil, my beliefs are strange.
How could I give people free will, without giving them E-vile?
We will keep it together, we believe in the Roc
Long after you leave the place
Long after my breathing stops
My spirit is still vibrant, I will lead the flock
And that's the tip of the iceberg.
Could you hear the words of Christ in my scriptures
But I only write it for my niggas
As soon as I grab it, I eat it like a savage
And nobody doesn't have it, I get it like a marriage
I see you know rappers, I'm on my Ps and Qs and carrots
They don't understand damn well, don't they know my state?
No need to explain, my name is the only thing that matters
When the fools that bite me find that I'm a little hard to swallow
You're thinking it's hollow, the rhythm is rough and hard to follow
Hit you like bam biggity bam bam biggity bam
Boy is a magician, I'm definitely meant to make 8 digits
I ran into G Rap on the road to wealth
As soon as I get up I will never remember
What I touch, what I touch you know I'm going to hurt
So move on, hey, you gotta dig that nigga Jay
I am the best MC, I am the best MC in the world
I'm thorough in every city, my name is ringing
With drugs pulling and doing my thing and fucking that
Hitting the boot so ma'am joke my money flips
I see you looking when I'm crazy, nigga stop ripping
6 digits before agreeing, cold son
Who is that? With a tip of the melodramatic, the crew returned
I [?] The way I do that
Don't even try that shit
I have skills until it's unreal
So what was said about a brother being as good as me
You know that shit is dead, right? That shit is dead
Here I come, ag-ga-ga-gain, I run from top to top
Niggas that don't duck, I'll pay and, damn, I'm wild

With the crown prince of the underground
Sweat now, Jay Z is on, go to the next town
The punks jump to hit each other, check it out, check it out, check it out
Ladies will come [?] Now
This boy has abilities
It's a shame the way I'm breaking the rough beat through town
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-di-di
J-A, baby, baby, please give me Ps
Baby baby, with crazy ease
While Jay Z gets crazy cheese
I take a break and then I kill, I never get in my way
(Hook)
I am the best MC, I am the best MC in the world
I am the best MC, I am the best MC in the world
(Verse 1)
As soon as I grab it
I eat it like a savage
I get it like a marriage
I'm looking for all the rappers
I'm on my p and q and carrots
I'm flowing the fattest (mmmm), that is (mmm), I am the baddest
For the suckas that bite me
They find I'm a little hard to swallow
You think it's hollow
My rhythm is too strong to follow
Hit you like bam, biggeda bam bam, biggeda bam ... okay?
Boy is a magician, I'm definitely meant to make eight digits
I ran into g rap on the way to wealth
Ugh, the black will kill
So move heyyy you gotta dig that nigga jayyyyy ...
(Hook)
I'm thorough, in every city
To throw drugs
And doing my thing and
But fuck that
Boot-knockin
Some lady got jockin ', my money got flippin'
Six digits before reaching an agreement son relax
For the brothers I give you some advice, like, don't even try that shit
I got skills until it's not real, it broke, I'm speeding up to one hundred eighty thousand trillion mills
So what is said, about a brother as kind as me
Why ask why when the shit sounds this fly?
(Hook)
(Verse 3)
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I come, agu-gu-gu-gain
Run, up-up-up on
Niggas is duh-du-duckin, boo-boo-boo-buck it, dammit, I'm wild
Bitta boo boo boo bam

I see you brought a small crew ... and?
I'm still coming fast, check it out
Jid-ay, id-ay, wid-iah, zid-ee, uhuhhh
Aren't there any of these clowns fucking around?
It is none of these clowns, who stand firm, with the prince crowned from underground
Jay z is on, go to the next city, punks
Jump and get beat up
Check it out, check it out, check it out, ladies
Get out to your seats now (wow!)
This boy has abilities
Tunini-nunini-nunini-nu-nu-ni-diddy
Hit them with a beat, me
Hit them and divide them. I made them. I get rid of them.
J-A, baby baby please give me fees
Baby baby, we're crazy, while Jay-Z goes crazy G's
I choose a prayer, then I kill, I never bring in my way
I'm cutting your shit, hey ... okay?
(Outro)
Aiight?
Jay z, 1994 and forever
Clark Kent made the tracks lovely ... okay?
So do you act like Bo Jackson and get fashionable?
Actually ... niggas can't fuck, all niggas can't see me
Than? Than? Than? I'm out...
(Scratches)
I am the best MC, I am the best MC, I am the best MC
I am the best MC, I am the best MC, I am the best MC
I am the best MC, I am the best MC in the world (the best MC in the world)
I thought this was people from the United States!
Uhh, yeah, guilty until proven innocent, huh?
This is how we work, huh? Okay
Before me there were many; after me there will be none
I am the
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we play
Yes, I get it, anxious, the public can't wait
Niggas had to have it long before its release date
Jigga gets mad, press, fuck him
It took me an eight point but I had to clarify it
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga gives food to the thinking dog, gets a plate
I get it, I break it when I get in the mood
I don't bend, break, bend, scratch, bass
Does my mental Rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggas bother my mom
Stopped, put in alignment, trying to put dents in my armor
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm a liver that most
I am not trying to collide with people
But I don't want people to take Jigga for a joke
I guess you niggas just woke up - good morning!
All of you cats can't touch me
You can't touch me, no, you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to accuse me but I'm not guilty
I have all my moms
tell me what do you want from me
Tell me ... what do you want from me?
I'm not guilty
I see how you come to me now, I'm great
I'm not the snitch, I'm not going to the police to get rich
.. I go to the block and throw
I go with the Glock and I click, I go with the pop I'm sick
Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils
If I'm your rival, why should I ask you?
Press try to throw dirt on my name, disturbing my game
I have a lot of money, great lawyers to fight
Like Cochran, motherfucker, you never see me locked up
Everyone knows, Jigga is a fighter
All of you cats can't touch me
You can't touch me, no, you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to accuse me but I'm not guilty
I have all my moms
I have all my moms
tell me what do you want from me
Tell me .. (uhh, I'm the one)
Uhh, okay, you're on my radar, I got you too bitch
Got lame bitches trying to fuck my case
The same lame bitch I look for in your face
Darling, just mad, I fucking replaced her
In addition to a birthday pass without my touching my safe
But I will not lie, the head was sick
But what we have to do is put that mouth on a better bitch
You heard the rhetoric: "Jigga hit me on the head
With a bottle of champagne at the bar, can you buy me a car? "
No, how do you equate your pain?
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I have one or two of those, nothing will change
For nothing else, you have to live with yourself
Try to lie in Hov because I walk on the highway
In what, most would describe it as a Rolls
NO, that's the Continental T
The only car I had left intercontinental, not guilty
All of you cats can't touch me
You can't touch me, no, you can't touch me
And you want to accuse me, when I'm not guilty
I have all my moms
tell me what do you want from me
Tell me what do you want from me?
Not guilty
Uhh, uhh, uhh, I'm the one
(All of you cats can't touch me)
So you can't touch me black, you can't touch me
Said Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I have all my moms
And I have all my moms
tell me what do you want from me
I don't know why, they can't see that
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I have all my moms
tell me what do you want from me
So tell me what you want from me
All of you cats can't touch me
You all niggas can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I have all my moms
And I have all my moms
So tell me what you want from me
All of you cats can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
I have all my moms
tell me what do you want from me
All of you cats can't touch me
If it's magic
Uhh, Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz
And it's a Heavy D production, you bastards
Ha (it's the rock) if I
Let's go
Let's go
Post Positano, Hov 'hanging with Bonus
U2 can live like Salvatore Ferragamo
And you too can cool off by the pool at the Delano
Because who knew the guy who loved McDonald's apple pies
Soon I would be the boss of the Big Apple, you know
And who knew the guy who played ball for the NBA
I would make a mistake in those who knew properties, throw it away
Who knew that would be his last shot, who made that move
They give and take life it's cruel like that
But even a broken watch is correct at least twice a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like twice today
Now here's something you should say to Jay twice
I have my shadows waiting for the sun to shine on my way
I have my boom box, tanning lotion waiting for action
They say that when you play with skills, good luck can happen
Let's go
(Come on) It's the Roc
(Come on) It's the Roc
Let's Rock
Things got too hot, so I jumped on this rap shit
Too many district attorneys concerned about actions
Of an individual, is criminally linked
Dating all the models and actresses
I'm learning all the bumps in every neighborhood
Through rap and whatever's going on
Rocawear, I'm the young black Ralph Lauren
The Michael Corleone from the microphone.
The Michelangelo of the flow, I paint pictures with poems
I don't pick up moss like a rolling stone
In case the Grim Reaper visits my house, nigga, I'm gone, come on
(Come on) It's the Roc
(Come on) let's rock (come on)
Life is about guns and roses
Bittersweet as friends and foes is
Some are left behind and others are chosen
Like life, guns and roses
Life is about guns and roses
Like life, guns and roses
Visibly shaken from the invisible bully (come on)
Flowers need water to grow, it has to rain
To experience joy you need pain
Every time a baby is born, someone dies
You know the saying, someone loses, it's someone else's gain
The sun rises when the water falls down the drain
Even a dumpster puts on a steak
But when your path turns before it drifts away
I have to turn that into something you have to learn from Jay
You will get a return on your investment if you pay attention, come on.
(Come on) It's the Roc
(Come on) It's the Roc
(Come on) It's the Roc
(Come on) that's right (come on)
Life is about guns and roses
Bittersweet as friends and foes is
Some are left behind and others are chosen
Like life, guns and roses
Life is about guns and roses
Bittersweet as friends and foes is
Some are left behind and others are chosen
Like life, guns and roses
Take out the bass line
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it hit though
Is life hard for us
Is life hard for us
Instead of being treated, they deceive us
Instead of kisses, they kick us
It's hard life!
From standing in the corners, boppin '
Drive some of the most popular cars New York has ever seen
Of dropping some of the most popular verses that rap has heard
From the drug scene, with the Glock smoke
Running away from the crime scene, you know me well
From the nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when all of you niggas know that I failed? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust bumps
And if you're with me, mom, rub your tits and what not
Let the strangers rape our blocks and my plot
Let's defend the world and divide it 50/50, uh-huh
And drink the Cris' and get mad
You know it's hell when I pass
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
All of you niggas get ready!
Is life hard for us
Is life hard for us
Instead of being treated, they deceive us
Instead of kisses, they kick us
It's hard life!
I flow for those 'expelled
All my niggas locked up at 10 by four, controlling the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn them and you can get them back
Daddy, I prefer that
I flow for girls who want, they do not have to undress to pay the tuition
All my ballers that were born to time
I know I'll be on top whether I act or not
Sleeping on futons and cribs for King Size
Green machines, 5 green
I've seen cakes, let the thing between my eyes analyze the ills of life
Then I put it down like Braille
I'm a tight grill with the fake
Rappers, all of you can feel that we are friends
I'm like, "Still, you guys don't know me."
Is life hard for us
Is life hard for us
Instead of being treated, they deceive us
Is life hard for us
Instead of being treated, they deceive us
Instead of kisses, they kick us
It's hard life!
I don't know how to sleep, I have to eat, be alert
I have a lot of beef, so logically, I take advantage of my enemies
Hustlin 'is still inside me, and when it comes to progress
It would be hard to find another rapper as hot as me
I gave you prophecy in my first joint, and you all left
I didn't really appreciate it until the second came out
So I extended the game, I recorded your name
Is life hard for us
Is life hard for us
Instead of kisses, they kick us
It's hard life!
Bounce
Left and right
Come on
Uh
Uh
Uhuh
Sing now!
Is life hard for us
It is hard life for us!
Instead of being treated, they deceive us
Instead of kisses, they kick us
It's hard life!
From standing in the corners boppin '
Drive some of the most popular cars New York has ever seen
For dropping some of the most popular verses that rap has heard
From the drug scene, with Glock smoke running away from the crime scene
You know me well ...
From the nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when do you all know that I failed? Nuh uh
Where all my brother with the rubber grips, bust bumps
And if you rub my hips with my mom, and what not
I'm from the school of hard knocks, we shouldn't
Let strangers rape our blocks, and my plot
Let's defend the world and divide it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and be really jiggy, uh-huh
And drink the Cris' and get mad
You know it's hell when I pass
Shawn Carter's life and times, you Volume 2, all of you niggas get ready
Sing!
It is hard life for us!
(I can't hear them all)
Instead of being treated, they deceive us
Instead of kisses, they kick us
It's hard life!
And I made myself so easy to love
How much do they hate it? very!
Kiss girls like Katy Perry
I was never born, but jump, Jerry
King as T.I., but in Chi, Larry ...
Both are American gang members
You choose who is colder
Rappers get nasty in the booth but I'm grosser
More real because I'm closer
I had girls in sashes that weighed more than they should
Poser, no sir
My hustle, so Russell
I stretch work, yoga
Al Roker used to take pounds off
It is nothing for me to remove nouns
In these MCs praying for my fall
They just hate
I greet you, I'm such a player
I'll never finish, I'm so ra-re
We're killing the game, it's not fair
You damn you stay there
Because we are high up in the air
We take off like a laser
Nigga, pee-une, pee-une, pee-une
Come back give me room room room
DB9 like vroom, vroom, vroom
Young Hov ', what do we do, do we do?
We're dancing bitches
Eating all the food, leaving dishes
Why are these niggas always talking Lear talk, 'Ye?
Why do I never see them in Clearport, Ye?
Why do they always listen to them at the airport?
While I fly daily like I'm in the Air Force?
So stop talking bad to me
Millionaire talk
You hate, you're mad at me because your newspaper
You need to put on your damn weight
Wait wait wait I'm not done
It hurts when you say it's not me
You hate, how do I get your favor?
I need to know why I care
I need you to love me, I swear, look here!
Look 'Ye is running Chi like Gale Sayers
I have the mayor on my pager
I need you, stay there, I breathe you like air
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
First the Fat Boys separate, now every day I get up
Does anyone have a problem with Hov
What happens? You niggas are fed up cause I got some cheddar cheese
And my record leaves the store?
Young guys fuck spitting on me, young rappers come up to me
My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly
"Mo 'Money, Mo' Problems" - I have to move carefully
‘Because fags hate when you get money as athletes
Youngins is roasting me, oh, aren't you feeling me?
Well it didn't cost you anything, don't listen to me
Sensitive thugs, you all need hugs
Damn, little man, I'm just trying to do it
If the record is two thousand, I'm just trying to move three
Get a couple of girls, make them try E
I hope they get married before I get to my garage
I don't want much, dammit, I drove all the cars
Some good cooked food, some good clean drawers
I know you wait on the wing, but I'm doing my thing
Where is the love?
There is no love in the heart of the city.
I said, where's the love?
There is no love in the heart of the city
And then the Fugees will break
Now every day I wake up, someone has something to say
Why is all that fucking uproar?
Why do I have more food and keep heat as if it were the oven door?
Niggas pray and pray for my fall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce like a round ball
Now I don't want to have to kill the soundboys
I don't want to have to lift the four pound barbell
Look, junk, I have nephews to take care of
I'm not looking at you friends, I'm looking at you beyond
I thought I told you characters, I'm not a rapper
I can live? I told you in '96 that I came to take this shit
And I ran my business, I fought like Randall with his
Cunningham, but the only thing that works is the numbers, fam
Jigga held you six summers, damn, where's the love?
There is no love in the heart of the city.
I said, where's the love?
Then Richard Pryor goes and burns
And Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up with more shit
Now that I'm successful, you'll get this shit out
Nigga, I will step on your porch, I will step on your boss
Let's finish the speculation, I'm talking to everyone
Men shouldn't be jealous, it's a feminine trait
They don't know my expenses, I have to buy bigger plates
Hehehe, and more bags, why are you all aggie?
Nigga, respect the game, that should be
There is no love in the heart of the city.
I said, where's the love?
There is no love in the heart of the city
First the Fat Boys separate, now every day I get up
Anyone have a problem with Hov '
And my records are moving?
My nigga Big predicted the shit exactly
"Mo 'Money, Mo' Problems" - I have to move carefully
See, I'm on my cousin, I don't have time to frontin
If the record is two million, I'm only trying to move three
Get a couple of girls, make them try E
I hope they do before I get to my garage
Bird ass niggas, I don't wanna ruin them
I know you wait on the wing but I'm doing my thing
Where is the love?
"There is no love, in the heart of the city ..."
I said where is the love?
Yes..
And then the Fugees are going to break, now every day I wake up
What's all that fucking fuss about? Because I'm more grubbin
Niggas pray and pray for my fall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce like a round ball
Now I don't want to have to kill the soundbar
I don't want to have to lift the four pound barbell
Look scrapper, I have nephews to take care of
I thought I told you characters, I'm not a rapper
I can live? I told you in ninety-six
That I came to take this shit and I did it, run my business
I rush like Randall with his
"There is no love, in the heart of the city ..."
Niggas, where's the love?
"There is no love, in the heart of the city ..."
Hello to me !!
"There is no love" (take them to church) "in the heart of the city ..."
Uh, uh, uh - my nigga where's the love?

Shit
Then Richard Pryor goes and gets burned, and Ike and Tina Turner part ways
Then I wake up with more shit
Now that I'm successful, you'll get this shit out
Let's finish the speculation, I'm talking to all of you
How crazy because you push dime and he sells weight?
You don't know my expenses, I have to buy a bigger place
Hehehe, and more bags, why are you all aggie?
Nigga respects the game, that should be
Where is the love?
"There is no love, in the heart of the city ..."
"There is no love, in the heart of the city ..."
"There is no love, in the heart of the city ..."
"There is no love, in the heart of the city ..."
First the Fat Boys separate, now every day I get up
Anyone have a problem with Hov '
What happens? All cats are fed up because I have some cheddar cheese

Young cats catch me, young rappers spit on me
My friend Big predicted exactly this
Because the cat hates when you get money as athletes
Young people are roasting me, ohh, aren't you feeling me?
Penalty fee; it doesn't cost you anything, don't listen to me

Sensitive thugs, everyone needs hugs
Damn little man, I'm just trying to make myself
If the record is two thousand, you know I'm trying to move three
Get a couple of girls, make them try E
I hope they get married before I get to my garage

Where is the love?
(There is no love, in the heart of the city)
I said where is the love?
(There is no love, in the heart of the city)
And then the Fugees will break, now every day I wake up
Why so much fuss? Because i'm ripping more
They pray and pray in my fall
But every time I hit the ground I bounce like a round ball
I don't want to have to give the four-pound boy his cock
Look scrapper, I have nephews to take care of
I'm not looking at you friends, I'm looking at you beyond
I thought I told you cats that I'm not a rapper
I can live? I told you in '96
That I came to take this shit and I did it, run my business
I rush like Randall with his
Cunningham but the only thing that runs are the fam numbers

Then Richard Pryor left and got burned and Ike and Tina
You met me before the records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful, you'll pull this shit

Men shouldn't be jealous, that's a feminine trait

Everyone surrenders for Jagwar Wright come on
That's all that baby, that's all that
That's it Jay
Ayo, react, biatch nigga
I think they mess with the rich black
Jigga, they can't touch you
Say you, we live (?)
Niggas fags, don't play with ours, my team will kill yours
No, say yours, I can't waste my time, let's put yours
With our hands in the air, I swear to God
Since money is respected, you know I had to get it
Pick it up as antiques and let it stack
Drrrrrrrrrrrr as well
I mastered this quick shit, now I'm moving on
And now you see me nervous, puzzled
He is not selling any records, is he? That nigga has to hurry
Huh, you can bet your weapons, either way, I have mine
You step in, anyway, I do
Your whole team has to show Jay love
Simply because my thing is tighter than O.J. gloves ha
I sink and fall like ditches
But when I rap I come out like that without fail
The black cat never crossed riches
I'm leaving Stevie saying it's no wonder you're superstitious
Beef, I'm with it, simple, everyone can get it
... not everyone understands
Because all that matters is this money, until it's not fun
Do you feel Me? When the beat screams kill me
Don't bother me, boy, I rip it silly!
I'll let you up, of course, but if you don't fall alone
MC I cut my knees like shorts
It gets worse if you don't care about my sick thoughts like a nurse
No known remedy
I will leave the boys and men on their knees until the end of the road
I, lock, load, fuck this record shit
With a sale, my bracelet certified gold with rocks
Check it out, uh, check it out, uh
It will take the feds to break us
I hope to speak for all when I say that there is no mass in this world that can escape from us
I hold him as a rapist for these papers
Once video touching my crime, monitoring my sleep
With every word I teach, through every word and speech
If all of you blacks aren't talking about big money, what's the point?
On the (Roc-A-Fella) had fallen (YES!)
One day when I was traveling on the train, I saw these two children talking
On the (Roc-A-Fella) had fallen (YES! Roc-A-Fella, everyone! OWWW!)
THIS NEW YORK!
Before Stack Bundles died he said I was the remake of Biggie
BIG. Tell Stacks he wasn't lying. I'm really busy (Did you hear Diddy ?!)
I'm listening to damn it, did I say that? !
Should I be a millionaire where the hell is the bread? ! (Where is the money?)
Come on niggas, come to me and say
You should have signed 50 instead of logging in with Jay (WORD!)
Man, I got six Jay figures, I'm straight
You little group niggas poking my face out! (UHHHHH!)
Chris Lighty told me to tell everyone to lower my cock
I'm connected, how do you know I'm not fucking with Fif? ! (G-G-G-G-G)
Scammers yell at me, how about Murd?
I heard you understood, but you overloaded the blacks for that work (I AM!)
You get it for a low price but your prices are WOOO!
(He's about to be taller!)
I am as if that is the mother's TRUTH! (But it's fire!)
Shit, you know where I have to go to get it
I feel like Frank Lucas before I started diving
She asked for it, her man saw it, so it doesn't mean anything to me.
Gone, and that's how it's supposed to be
Check it out now! (I get away with mur-mur-murda!)
She asked for it, her man saw it, so it doesn't mean anything to me.
Gone, and that's how it's supposed to be
Let's do it ...
I applaud the niggas for yappin out of follish
There is no way to stop this Roc-A-Fella movement
The name is Jay Guevara, friend, who are you and
Your unconventional DJ? If something plays, it sounds familiar
I'll wait until Pharrell says, ("Lame ...")
Now I gotta turn you down, Joe
You can get hit for that, in fact
The gats are flown, the natural like Roy Harve '
The tough boy, your Toy Squad will be crushed, BOY!
Yardee, you will be lost at the source
Partly because all of you bosses are not leaders
He's a follower, (NO!) No, I'm not copulating you
Album or your single, you are likely to become coppa
Coca cola, fast cooking K
She asked for it, her man saw it, so it doesn't mean anything to me.
Gone, and that's how it's supposed to be
Check it out now! (I get away with mur-mur-murda!)
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you ever seen the doors?
And do you know what heaven tastes like? Knock me out
Knowledge, wisdom, freedom, understanding, we just want our equality
Happiness for a gangsta, there is no love in these streets
Conspiracy theorist screaming Illuminati
They cannot believe that this ability is in the human body.
Aw fuck you got me
Question religion, question everything
Question existence until questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic, I will be in Marrakech
Morocco smoking hashish with my camaraderie
You dwell on the devil's shit, I'm on a devil
Cool in my Easter clothes feeling like Jesus and
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you bowed to your highness?
And do you know what heaven tastes like? Knock me out
That's me in the corner, that's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion, losing my religion
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on a 'ghini
I'm secular, tell the hecklers to buckle up
Every religion creates division like my Maybach partition
And God is my driver, boy, they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn, where I grew up
Live among the snakes, turn sands into churches
I'm like Michael, recycle, these are not 16
These are verses from the Bible.
Tell that preacher that he is a preacher, I am a damn prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a golden cup.
I had luggage, which means I had luggage
Only God could judge us, motherfuckers, huh
Have you ever been to heaven?
Have you bowed to your highness?
And do you know what heaven tastes like? Knock me out
Heaven or hell, the letters that have been dealt to us
It's the cards we play, we play, we play
When the shots spray, spray, spray
Hello!
Brooklyn!
Hi Brooklyn (Uh-huh), how are you? (Yes)
Where are you going? Can i come too (Uh huh)
And if I can (Woo!), I'll be your man
And drive my cars (Cars), and go crazy (So crazy)
Wherever you go (Where are you going?), Girl, just take me (Uh-huh)
Because I'm so surprised, if you take it (I'm so surprised)
I'm just saying (Woo!), Baby, I'm just saying
Like a mother, you give birth to me; Brooklyn, you took care of me
Educated me with hard knocks, better than Berkeley
They said you would kill me when I was 21
That shit bothered me, but you never hurt me
Guess what I will call her? Brooklyn Carter
When I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend you
Because you know I only went out to dinner
And I'm eating, so much, I bought extra
So much so that dinner turned into breakfast
I just roll Lexus to hug your way
I love your corners, I'm half your soul
Hi Brooklyn, how are you doing?
Where are you going? Can i come too
And if I can, I'll be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
Because I'm so surprised if you took it
Hi Brooklyn, what's your story?
She said she was eating on the run, but it's not Nore '
She said she had a man, but he was not concerned.
She said she loved B.I.G., and that she likes 2Pac.
And when I said Jay-Z, she said, "It's the Roc!"
And I'll leave it like this, like this, like this
Where is Brooklyn? Where is Brooklyn?
Have you seen her?
And when she tells you something, you better believe her
She said she likes my New Orleans behavior
And "Hello Brooklyn!" Buh-baby, you are
I said, "Hello, Brooklyn!" Buh-baby
I hope you never say goodbye
Very good to me
And I remember the time (Time), the place (Place)
And the weather (Y, woo!)
The day you said "Hello"
Brooklyn, you are crazy; look how you did to me
Razor blades in my mouth, spinning around, behaving ...
All insane; black hoodies and Timberland-ed
Always intriguing: "See the glitter on that black pendant?"
(Hello Brooklyn) You are a bad influence, look what you made me do
But I'm not mad at you (Haha), look at my attitude
Baby, I'm cold as ice, like I'm from Brownsville
But my bed is in the Stuy, although I will lie in your bush
Until we smoke a C.I., "What's wrong" with the boy, B.I.?
You know I drive B-I, I don't step on the caine
She likes hardcore, so I move slowly
Iller that Albee Square Mall back at 9-0
So in a couple of years, baby, I'll bring you some nets (Woo!)
Hi Brooklyn, how are you doing? (Yes)
And if I can, I'll be your man
You could be my lady and have my baby
And drive my cars (Errr!), And go crazy (Errr!)
Wherever you go baby, just take me
Because I'm so surprised if you took it
I'm just saying baby, I'm just saying (Yeah)
And hello Brooklyn, buh-buh-baby, you are
The sweetest thing the eyes could see
Hello brooklyn
Baby I hope you never say goodbye
I said, "Hello, Brooklyn."
Very good to me
But I remember the time, the place and the weather.
The day you said hello to me
And I said "Hi Brooklyn"
Oh, I have a resolution
This year I am playing well
No 6:15 this year, yeah you can spend the night
We can go bowling, it's not like before
Can't you see I'm growing? I was so immature
I was young and had money
Let the honeys come to the crib
Dig in your shit
Some bad girls didn't cross the bridge
I went to 1 Trump Plaza in their asses
No room service, just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil Debbies
And when you're done, get ready
The chicks he was ready to crush
I'll take you on long trips
Break them with a long cock
Strong relationships did not exist.
But I'm out of that gamer shit
Who can still buy weed
And can you give me a good head
And I will do it mommy
(Hello Daddy!)
(Hello Daddy!)
Promise you will never let me go
The only thing that Bleek turns is
Those chrome wheels spin them new tires
Home suspended from school again
I'm an adult, I'm still sick, ladies love the ve-hi-cle, like "Bleek
Can I feel your wood and grill? "
It's a hooded thing, wood grain, off the chain
I love the way I push my lingo
Calling my cat soon when they jump on my V
They contact, the grass smokes everything in the tissue
I bet your man can't do it like that, like this
Hoes, they all record as:
I had crazy niggas, really, like, "I wish I was gay."
Because they knew that sooner or later he was picking on Jay
It was only a matter of time: he was getting on with Jay
I'll have your girl in the summer tropics drinking zae
Spitting on the Pacifics, smoking joints in the shade
She used to love you, but today she feels different
You used to suffocate her. Watch your honey run away
Along with the scammers, niggas who are giving you space
She said she feels free when she's around me
She talks on the phone with her friends like, "How cool is he?"
Yes Yes Yes
Ayo, I have a resolution
No 6:15 and shit (but)
You can stay the night
Can't you see I'm growing?
I was so immature
I was young and had money
Have honies come to the crib
Some bad girls didn't cross the bridge
I went to One Trump Plaza up the ass'
No room service, just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil 'Debbies and when you're done get ready
Let them lean on the cash
Take them on long trips
Break them with a long cock
Strong relationships did not exist.
I need a girl who practices Tai Chi
And I can still buy weed
And can you give me a good head
I'll make him remind me, can you hear me?
(Hello Daddy)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies go
(Hello Daddy)
Promise you will never leave me
I promise we will grow, they say
(Hello Daddy)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies go
Promise you will never let me go
Promise you will never leave me
I promise we will grow, they say
I used to change chicks every day
I had real crazy niggas like, "I wish I was gay"
Because they knew, sooner or later he was messing with Jay
I'll have your girl in the tropics, somewhere drinking zae
Spitting in the Pacific, smoking joints in the shade
Along with the scammers, niggas who are giving you space
She said, she feels free when she's around me
I let her do it and in turn she is making me
She is on the phone with her friends like, "How cool is he?"
(Hello Daddy)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies go
(Hello Daddy)
Promise you will never let me go
Promise you will never leave me
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies go
(Hello Daddy)
Promise you will never let me go
Promise you will never leave me
I promise we will grow, they say
I was nice to the girls, but that was not the Shawn they felt
They said the coupe was fine, but they are not like the seat belt.
I look tight, they told me to relax, turn on a couple of lights
Spank them, pull their hair, just don't treat them so well
Good guys finished last, they were a special set of rules
And I exaggerated it (uh-huh), all chauvinists
I would treat them so viciously, caress them, but not kiss them
But now, I'm trying to flow differently
I'm trying to cool it down now
I'm trying to plant a seed, start a new edition
I'm sick of chasing chickens
Sick of any other city we go to, the same hoes
(Hello Daddy)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies go
(Hello Daddy)
Promise you will never let me go
Promise you will never leave me
(Hello Daddy)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies go
(Hello Daddy)
Promise you will never let me go
Promise you will never leave me
I promise we will grow, they say
(Hello Daddy)
Even if they don't understand the flow
They understand the dough
My ladies go
(Hello Daddy)
Promise you will never let me go
Promise you will never leave me
I promise we will grow, they say
(Hello Daddy)
My ladies go
(Hello Daddy)
Promise you will never let me go
Promise you will never leave me
I promise we will grow, they say
(Hello Daddy)
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory is finally ours (Lighters, lighters)
The story so loved, so long, so long, so long
In search of victory, she keeps eluding me
Why don't you visit me until she visits me?
She gives me agony, so much agony
She brings me so much pain, so much misery
How to miss your last shot and fall to your knees
I've practiced so much for now that victory doesn't go away
I know what this means, I'm caught up in this routine
A whole new day different, but the same things as always
All I have are dreams, but no one else could see
No one else believes, no one but me
Where are you victory I desperately need you
Not just for now, to make history
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
The story so loved, so long, so long, so long
Pushing like a G, while victory wasn't watching
As a teenager, before acne
Before being proactive, I couldn't face her
I put on my sweatshirt and headed for the streets.
I swear I knew success, we live together shortly
A success is like lust, she is good to touch
It is good at the moment, but it is never enough.
Everyone had her, she doesn't look anything like V
But I'm burning the block, going in and out of V
But something tells me that there is much more to see
Before they kill me, cause they can't steal from me
So before me, success and death ménage
We have to be together to make history
Now that all the smoke is gone (lighter)
And the battle finally won (give me a lighter)
Victory is finally ours (Lighters, lighters)
The story so loved, so long, so long, so long
Now the victory is mine, she tastes so sweet
She is my trophy wife, she comes with me
We'll have a baby who stutters repeatedly
We will call it history, he will repeat after me
He is my legacy, the son of my hard work.
Rank me among the greats, be it 1, 2 or 3
If I'm not number one, then I failed you the victory
I'm not in this for the fame, who dies in a few weeks
I'm not in this for the money, I can't take it when you go
I want to be remembered long after you grieve
I leave everything that I am, in the hands of history.
This is much more than a song, it's a baby shower
I've been waiting for this hour, story, you're ours
Ah ch-ch ah, ch-ah, ah uh-uh
Ah ch-ch ah, ch-ah, ah uh-uh
It's that jump I'm talking about here, Timbo!
I can't be stopped when he jumps like this family, hey!
And I won't deliver it with Timbaland rhythms
Shut your mouth my baby
All I wanna do is stroke all of you crazy
My cocksucking game is vicious, crazy for bitches
Mommy keeps coming back because mommy turned cruel
Catch Hov 'in the fall, nasty thang, lane change
"Bujando, bujando!" - the police are coming
I have that rap patrol behind me: start running
I'm unstoppable Hov ', unstoppable flows
I am the compadre, the Sinatra of my day.
Ol 'Blue Eyes my nigga, "I did it my way"
If you ain't rolling with Hov, then hit the road
"Hi hovito!" Yes, yes "Hello Hovito!"
Yeah that's what they say when the music plays
"Hi hovito!" Yes, yes "Hello Hovito!"
Put it down for my people
Yes Yes Yes Yes
No, I'm not fucking, I'm staying in my J.O.-
I've been on that dough since I was one day
Oh, push Parakeet if I need him for the Root of Evil
Born in the womb: that's how the streets raise you
So I could really experience this as my last movie
6 oohie, dripping jewelry, great tool
And with the third choice, I made the earth sick
Rhyme sicker than all those who spit out rhymes
Every criminal nigga who rhymes or plays a microphone
Because my mind is faster
I'm an '88er, '96 to reasonable doubt
Short temperament; don't take long to squeeze yourself
Yeah you're shining but the only thing you're leaving
You're a candle in the sun, that shit doesn't even go out
Yeah that's what they say when the music plays
Put it down for my people
"Hi hovito!" Yes, yes "Hello Hovito!"
Yeah that's what they say when the music plays
To hold; naw muh'fuckers - you muh'fuckers
You better run to the post office and get a job, muh'fuckers
Or starve, motherfuckers, because Jay has been the only one
Eating so far, motherfuckers below par
All in one, because none has more flow than Young
Also I have more flows to come
And if I'm not better than Big, I'm the closest
So move on - hoes, pick Hova
My food for thought is so hot that it gives you ulcers
Rovers, roasters, hoes is
Entering with me, living as they should
Watches, chain, first row in the game
Exhausted sand, everyone yelling my name, come on!
Yeah that's what they say when the music plays
Put it down for my people
Yeah that's what they say when the music plays
Put it down for my people
It is not for everyone! (Uhh)
Welcome to Hollywood baby (take a picture)
Uh-huh, are you coming with? (Let's not even talk about it)
Let's do it (come on) uh-huh
I see your jealousy as you look (I see you looking at me, baby)
You are watching (everything is fine)
You're looking (uh-huh, come on)
I see your face (I see your face)
You want to touch it (you want to touch it)
Come to my house (come to the crib)
And let's discuss it (let's cut it)
Tonight you will be a superstar, baby
Come on, let me sign you up (let's go in)
You're blinded by the (action!)
You need that (Hollywood!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh, it's the lights
You're blinded by (satisfaction!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Paparazzi sees me in the lobby of my skyscraper
I hide behind my shadows because fame is blinding my eyes
I had once felt it when it was as high as me
I have to make this stop
People often warn me that fame is not for the faint of heart
Strange, things have happened
Born in Brooklyn, I have a place in Manhattan
Returning to Brooklyn to escape the madness
When your friends are Chris and Gwyneth
When your girl is more famous than you, then she is
It's time to tint all your windows
Keep your eyes half closed, it's a flash anytime
The music business is like musical chairs
It's about where you stand when the music stops spinning
Ooh, it's the lights
You're blinded by the (action!)
You need that (Hollywood!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh, it's the lights
You're blinded by (satisfaction!)
You need that (Hollywood)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
You gotta get it (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
You want it? (Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
But you don't need it (oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
What do you do? Oh oh oh oh
Now that you have what you want
What do you do? Oh oh oh hey
Oh do you want more?
Hello sir, pay six-a, a list-a, it's in the mist of
The ride of your life but you gotta keep hitting them
I can't let my guard down, I have to keep my gloves on
Take a sip, sir, it's so intoxicating, isn't it?
Try not to get fed up, Hollywood has been good to you
Starting to feel like a buzz to you, don't lie
I'm going to fly, you're addicted to lights
Without fame how will you survive
It's like living on heroin, so high
And everyone warns you (I tried to tell you)
And once you try, you can't live without it (it's addictive)
Not because you choose not to live without it
Are you sure you want this, baby?
Now it's part of you, now it's part of you (it's part of you)
I see you changed, I see you blinded
And once you taste you can't live
You're blinded by the (action!)
You need that (Hollywood!)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
Ooh, it's the lights
You're blinded by (satisfaction!)
You need that (Hollywood)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, come on
I want to be seen, male groupies
Now you've become what you once despised
Blow your whole life trying to live in the lights
Heroines following Marilyn
Jumping to the limit as Janis Joplin
Phoenix River, Jimi Hendrix
Jimmy Morrison, they all ended up
Hollywood, are you sure you want this baby?
Hollywood
It is the most addicted drug in the world.
Do you want fame? Do you want the lights?
You would take my clothes off and I'd leave you
You would steal the food from my mouth
(Thanks for warning me, thanks for warning me)
You curse my name despite embarrassing me
I hang my clothes on the street, dirty or clean
Give up fame
But I still don't know why, why I love him so much
(Thanks for warning me, thanks for warning me)
And, darling, it's amazing, I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you scream, you love me strong
The next day you are so cold
One day you are here, one day you are there, one day you care
You are so unfair
Drinking from your cup until it spills
Holy Grail
uh uh uh
Blue told me to remind you niggas, huh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, huh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, huh
Damn I like it
Bright lights are attractive, but look what he did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty thousand for a fight
But as soon as all the money explodes, all the pigeons take flight
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice; that's my bad I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me want to murder
Mom please just get my bail
I don't know anyone to blame; Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, huh
And all just artists
And all just artists
And, darling, it's amazing, I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
You are so unfair
Drinking from your cup until it spills
Holy Grail
Now i have tattoos on my body
I have enemies in the newspaper, photoshoots with paparazzi
I can't even take my daughter for a walk
See them at the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered
Enough already, I'm canceling this
Who the hell am I kidding?
I'm getting high, sitting low
Slipping into that great body, all the curtains on my window
This fame hurts, but this chain gets worse
I think you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit doesn't work
This light work, camera shooting, my eyes hurt
Niggas dying again where I was born
Fuck your irises and the IRS
You got the shit blacks die for, dry yours
Why are you angry? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with the bath water
You're still alive, you're still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still get bigger
Nigga, living life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson thriller
And, darling, it's amazing, I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you scream, you love me strong
The next day you are so cold
One day you are here, one day you are there, one day you care
You are so unfair
Drinking from your cup until it spills
You take the air out of my lungs when you need it
And you draw the sword from my heart
Just so you can see me bleed
And I still don't know why, why I love you so much, yeah
And you play this game despite driving me crazy
I have it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess who name
But I still don't know why, why our love is so much, yeah
(Thanks for warning me, thanks for warning me)
And, darling, it's amazing, I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you scream, you love me strong
The next day you are so cold
One day you are here, one day you are there, one day you care
You are so unfair
Drinking from your cup until it spills
Holy Grail
Well I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump
I'm cancer for the Hamptons
Increase noise pollution as soon as you land on
Don't even trust the upper class whites
Keep the barrel tucked
Niggas trying to lean on Jay, the shots are gonna stop you
Glocks gon 'pop, you guys don't understand much
I rush through the duckets
The girls now say they like the way I threw it away
Since my album fell, my stock grows as if it were public
Ladies, I love you all
But I love my freedom more
I love my niggas, I love to see them dance
I love beans and bleek
They niggas like my Peter and Paul
My disciples, and it is true, we go by the title ...
Do you believe? It's hova the god
If you have girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I have 99 problems, but a bitch is not a
I've got the rap patrol on the gat patrol
Enemies who want to make sure my coffin is closed
Rap critics who say it's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm like, "Fuck critics, you can kiss all my asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press forward. "
I have beef with radio if I don't play, show
They don't touch my blows, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags tries to use my black ass
So advertisers can give them more cash for their ads
Motherfucker, I don't know how you take me
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I have 99 problems, but a bitch is not one, hit me!
The year is '94, it's raw in my trunk
In my rearview mirror is the damn law
I have two options, you: stop the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal on the floor
And I'm not trying to see any chase on the road with Jake
Also, I got a few bucks, I can fight the case
I heard, "Son, do you know why I'm stopping you?"
Porque Because I am young and black and my hat is very low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I do not know
Am I under arrest or should I guess a little more?
"Well, you were doing 55 in 54
License and registration and get out of the car
Do you carry a gun with you? I know many of you are. "
I'm not getting out of shit, all my role is legitimate
And I know my rights, so you will need an order for that.
"Aren't you strong as a tack?
Are you some kind of lawyer or something?
Someone important or something?
Well, I haven't passed the bar, but I know a little
Enough for you not to illegally search my shit
"Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 arrives!"
I have 99 problems, but a bitch is not one, hit me!
If you have girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I have 99 problems, but a bitch is not one, hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch is not a
If you have girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I have 99 problems, but a bitch is not a
Now once not long ago
A nigga like me had to build a fort
This is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy
But a damn nonsense pussy, try to push me
I try to ignore it, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools love to act
But it wouldn't pop a grape in a fruit fight
And the only thing that will happen is that I will applaud
And he and his children are going to be barking at the Captain.
And there I go, stuck in the Kit-Kat again
Demons on the floor, scratching again
Paparazzi with their cameras, snapping them
GIVES. try to give it a black shaft again
Half a mile of bail because I'm African
Trying to interpret the child as if it were saccharin
But it's not sweet how I hold my gun
99 problems, but a bitch is not a
If you have girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I have 99 problems, but a bitch is not one, hit me!
Are you crazy about this, Rick
It's your boy
Yes I know you just ripped the package from your CD
If you're like me, you're reading the credits right now
If you're in your car, I don't care if it's winter
I want you to roll down all your windows ... outside area ... buckle up ... come on ...
Hi, I'm hova
That's young, the wait is over
Before we get into this shit, let's clear things up
Rappers unrelated, that's 7 degrees apart
And i'm kevin bacon
This is the murderous version
Jigga the shit, even when it rhymes in the third person
Hova the god, I should be rapping with a turban
Haters can't bother you, waiters can't serve you
Rap Mike Jordan, out of j working
Now look how fast I drop 50
Niggas can't catch me, niggas can't catch me
Slimmie at the Rucker wants to go and spend with me
I always take them out of the park like Ken Griffey
Do you believe? It is Hova the god ...
Well I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump
I'm cancer for the Hamptons
Increase noise pollution as soon as you land on
Glocks gon 'pop, you guys don't understand much
I hurried through the duchies, well now I hurry through the rush
How the fuck darling I love it
Chicks now, they say they like the way I threw it away
Since my album fell, my stock went up ... like it was public
Ladies, I love you all, but I love my freedom more
I love my niggas, I love to see them dance
I love beans and bleek
They niggas like my Peter and Paul
My disciples
And so it is, we come for the title
Do you believe? It is Hova the god ...
I used to rap to the raindrops on my window
Duckin 'the plain cops, pushing indo and' baton
On the kitchen table, late at night, no pen, just my brain
First album, black people loved me because they thought I was poor
I guess I'm successful, the industry doesn't want me anymore
But I'm the same nigga in your corner, bubbly
Skully bowed, pants down, almost touching the ground
And I come with rags to your so-called awards
T-shirt with my chain outside, like all of you
In hindsight, it hasn't been the same since I lost my dad
He's still alive, but still, fuck you, don't cross my path
A&R made me feel like Moss in the draft
So I closed the league with reasonable doubt
Take out your CDs
Let's go song by song
I'm the most deluded nigga I do it until they prove me wrong
Do you believe?
It is Hova the god ...
Yes I know you just ripped the package from your CD
If you liked it, you are reading the credits right now
If you're in your car, I don't care if it's winter
Outside area, fasten your seat belt, come on
Hello, it's hova; that's young, the wait is over
The new millennium is upon us, the album is here.
Before we get into shit, let's clear things up
Unrelated rappers:
There is "Seven Degrees of Separation" and I am Kevin Bacon
Jigga the shit, even when it rhymes in the third person
Hova the God, I should be rapping with a turban
Haters can't bother you, waiters can't serve you
Rap Mike Jordan, off Jay working
Now look how fast I drop 50
I don't like to play, niggas can't hit me
Niggas can't catch me, niggas can't catch me
Slimmy at the Rucker wants to go and spend with me
I always take them out of the park like Ken Griffey
Do you believe? It's hova the god
Makes you think of the people in your life
Then I think BIG; What would you say if you were here?
If you don't pass like a man, a man "
He said, "Hang in there, take the fall, make the time
That's what makes you who you are, makes you what you are "
How many years have you been around this thing of ours?
Commission, 125 years
What is it about?
It's about rules, parameters
You don't betray who you are, what you are
You have to remember guys like Taj, Chill, Ran, Emory
They don't roar, they don't rap
You know why? Those are the rules, don't break them
You were born to be something you weren't even supposed to be ... humble
Okay, now you humiliate me, what have you got?
You have a global criminal union
There are no rules, there are no parameters, there are no feelings
There are no feelings for this game
You're going to wish there was an American Commission
Five ten years from now ...
They'll miss Jay-Z
Okay, I'm recharged!
Who thought young Shawn Carter would change the game?
Duckin 'the simple polis, pushin' endo and 'caine
On the kitchen table, late at night, no pen, just my brain
First album, blacks love me because they thought I was poor
I guess I am successful; the industry no longer loves me
Well I'm the same nigga in your corner, bubbly
Skully bowed, pants down, almost touching the ground
T-shirt with my chain like shit, all of you
The hindsight has not been the same since I lost my dad
A&R made me feel like Moss in the draft
So I closed the league with reasonable doubt
I'm the most deluded nigga I do it until everyone proves me wrong
Do you believe?
It's Hova the God, uhh, uhh, uhh ...
Yes Yes!
Welcome to Jay-Z's quirkiness.
I would like to present my band right now.
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe
Right now I want you to hit the drummer
Not really, give the drummer a little
Uhh
Touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unwavering (it's Hovi baby)
Yeah, ch-chi-uh, uh-ch-ch-uh, unbreakable
Rock the unbreakable (it's Hovi baby)
Follow the flow, look
They say that a dwarf standing on the giant's shoulder can see a lot
Beyond the giant ... (the giant ...)
So I have the whole world of rap on my shoulder trying to see
Beyond what I am ... (what I am ...)
And I've been trying to be patient with your concern
With David and Goliath .. (Goliath ..)
But sooner or later, that patience will take its course
And I am forced to be a tyrant ... (to be a tyrant ...)
But me and Tyran, coming through their surroundings
Iron mask, nigga, iron gats, nigga I'm back
With "The team", no, me at that
R.O.C., you guys are not looking at that
You don't see, clearly because the rain is not gone
"The dynasty", no, not Ming but Shawn
Lady Kareem nigga is the gangsta team
Stop running, one of the reasons they call us gangrene
The other reason, we have a green band
If there's anything better about getting cheddar cheese that remains to be seen, nigga
I can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
I can't see the invisible, reach the unattainable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Jeah, look
Back to the future, I have to stop for the present
I'm fast, niggas can't pass my past
How do you propose to deal with my perfect gift?
When I unwrap The Gift & The Curse in one session
Only two that remain in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
Seven summers in a row, critics might not admit it
But no one in rap did it, like I did
If you did it, I did it before, you understand, I had it
I got mad at that and I don't want it anymore
Turning whores, turning vocal chords, don't twist it
I did the impossible and then I did it twice (do it right)
I can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
I can't see the invisible, reach the unattainable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Yep! Hovi's house, the global phone
The world is back in order, the number one rap recorder is back
You cats felt too much
You couldn't help it, now witness the real for real
In my absence cats are distracted
Why am I in the position that I am?
Well after I'm gone they'll honor
History in the making, Pete Gun
Leave the competition shaking without missing a beat (woo!)
Chasing the hi-hat all over the track
The trap is afraid of the air here, BOOM!
And I also get a paper dog, don't let me forget
The watch face as blue as if it were holding its breath
I can't see myself skill by skill or check by verification
It's the dog in the bow tie, I wear it around your neck
Rapper Executive bar, Kordell Stewart
Your flow all you use is mine, you are useless
You are all fags, you take us back (you do it back)
I'm trying to make progress with this rap shit
Nigga, nigga, your whole career is an accident
I can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unwavering (it's Hovi baby)
I can't see the invisible, reach the unattainable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
He fucks me with hova
want you to know
It's something about you
(He fucks me with Hova)
XO Trackmasters
Let's go!
Untouchable, unbreakable, unbreakable (it's Hovi baby)
I can't see the invisible, reach the unattainable
I have another!
Yes ... (Remix!) Yes ... Yes ... Baby (it's Hova)
First I had streets, then I had the letters
First I had his ears, now I have his heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I see them put them together, see them take them apart
Watch the rovers roll up with the ribbons
I see them repo, resold and re-driven, so when I recharge
And when your feet are cold, the mines sizzle
It's easy to see, niggas can't fuck with me
Cause I'm gonna be that black for life
This is God given, this is hard to live
Mixed with Cristal drinking
This is the most consistent (Hov!)
Give me as many hits as you can fit inside a double disc
Homie, I'm home on these lists, you niggas visit
This tradition Hov ', Jeff Gordon's rap
I'm about to claim pole position
Hello to you boy!
Shake the unwavering (it's Hovi baby)
I can't see the invisible, reach the unattainable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
You cannot move the immobile, stop the unstoppable
Up with the unstoppable (it's Hovi baby)
Yes ... (Remix) Yes ... Yes ... baby (it's Hovi)
I'm way ahead of my time
Look behind you, I'm about to pass you twice
Back to the future, I've got it slow for the present
When I unwrap "The Gift and the Curse" with a different verse
And I'm so far ahead of my time
My grandfather just met my grandmother at a prom
These rhymes are waiting
Until four years later, they left on time
I will probably take them, copy your four copies
You realize that every clue needed an autopsy
Like NYPD, LAPD, NYDA, OJ's Jury (yeah!)
I can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Up with the unstoppable (it's Hovi baby)
Yes ... (Remix) Yes ... Yes ... baby (it's Hovi)
Crush your clothes, what you're winning
If it's not him in person, keep guessing
I'm about to remove my shirt, fuck with Mitchell and Ness
I'm kicking old school kicks at the vet
Sixty-nine, yes, the same year I was born
Ninety-six, yes, it used to rhyme with the Don
Here's something the haters can't understand
Half a milli the first week, man, they still went out
Look, I even sell CD's in the crowd
The toughest guy since reasonable doubt
Hovi Baby, love me or blow me baby
They are in denial
Look at the lists, I'm wearing you down
I'm about to release The Black Album in a year
I can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
I can't see the invisible, reach the unattainable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Up with the unstoppable (it's Hovi baby)
Yes ... (Remix) Yes ... Yes ... baby (it's Hovi)
I rush into any hustle you throw
Skinny Nigga Stick
But I lift weights like I'm using roids
Rolls Royce keeps my movements smooth as I maneuver
Please don't compare me to other rappers
Compare me to the trappers
I'm more Frank Lucas than Ludacris
And Luda is my friend
I am not trying to reject
I will follow the rules no matter how long I have
I live and die with the decisions I choose
So to hell with caving, that's why we don't talk
Men are not supposed to make statements
At the end of the story I followed the code, deciphered the safe
Hurry up hurry up
Hurry up in any hustle you throw
Money to be made better create a niggas gloating
I run it myself as a quarterback option
He bought some clothes and brought me the helicopter.
See niggas try to kick but no I don't play soccer
A pack on the way you know my whip game proper
And of 1 ki I see 70 thousand dollars
I bet that with your gawdy we reached 5 points in a row
You rap about money and a nigga could sign you
You rap on me and a nigga could find you
Banana in the ass with the head just behind you
Dope game bitch his momma woulda bought em
If you yell at me, a fee
Bitches come a dime a dozen
Pussy goes, pussy comes
And when they come to you, they return me with money
I tell him to put on his shoes and keep my newspaper running
I left my mack like a G was supposed to
And if she doesn't come home with that, then she's sleeping
Got them crawling, we do it then a soda
They niggas below us, darling, we above and over
I'm trying to get into that thing between your shoulders
I'm talking about grand totals
I'm talking about big engines
I'm talking about burning rubber and then melting the Pirelli scent
I'm jumping a lotus, you're looking at my bitch
But when the event is over, you should send it back
I'm an enemy of scripts
If you are among my words, I will see you later
Because I'm an enemy of scripts
You are silent when I speak but I can see you on paper
You are taller than an underscore
But no more
To me you are as dead as Latin
I can't even hear you when I'm chatting
So why did you have to get involved? Like a great man who
Was there something wrong with my grammar? Well now it doesn't matter
My name is four letters divided by the button that is fatter
You're only good for the break, but when I got my flow
No one will stop me until I bring the applause
My alphabet goes from Jay to Z, you are not a suitable letter
So I have decided that a space is much better
This shouldn't come as a surprise to you, your type of character was ready to be fired.
So now that you're free, go vibrate with the brother asterisk
Forward slash, backslash, hash tag, comma, no thanks
Only the alphabet will work, I keep it simple with the two syllable
After zero is where you belong
At the end of all those numbers is where you're strong
Share with underlined cousin
More and the same sitting next to
All is not lost, you have established a legacy
On websites, tickets, registrations and CDs
This is not the end
You were more than a connector, you were my friend
There's a new journey on the horizon
I can't understand that
I have to keep it thick, never fail, so I hit them like this
Straight to the track, my handwriting is fantastic, I rip it
So many brothers bite their tongues to detect who I am
Look at the J, look at the A, look at the Y ... Z
Original rap, I'm slapping, I'm bending it like this
I'm that nigga with a gat boom-clack
Better than ever, never better, you better, whatever
I suggest some Ex-Lax and that will help you
I give you a runny nose from body bumps
No one is safe at a party, even Gotti says goodbye
I have-I have-I have Flav-flav-flav-flavor so save yours
A verse and it's a hearse I played and killed yours
Get it, got it, ready to flip, I doubt it
There's no need to drag on, Jigga the man, he's gone!
I'm out
The next nigga never rest, you're living with stress
Because around the corner, be the best nigga
You're dreading my influence if the grass has your mouth running
You better blow up that shit
The Jigga is back, you niggas are flat
I'll be amazed at how Jay raps now, how the hell did he say that?
You dig me the epitome of ripping it raw
Although you niggas are wetting my style, I'm still thirsty
And we all have to fall, but you first G
I will be the last, it will be a cold day in hell
We break shit and harmony like Take 6
While you niggas double pumped the fake shit
Our Roc-A-Fella never sells
Listens
I don't kick it, I kick it, I'm so evil you want it.
My tongue is tired of licking my fingers and counting hundreds
So I bought a money machine and it comes out
A tat-tit-trrrrrrr-at-tit-trrrrrt-at-tit-tit-Git-Dough
How many styles do I have to kick to prove I'm def?
I can even kick myself, rip that shit and breathe
This nigga is nothing but the truth
Many see Jay-Z as a threat to loot ... fuck them
My shit is tight, I can't slip, I have to hold on
Like a hole in a dogfight, my shit is aight
I'm not checking for you, except you, my people
And in case you didn't know, look at the steel
A penny goes through your mind
And two bone crushers for your spine
Because none of your games is harder than mine
So I face (I'm the man in the hood) the final curtain
(No, the REAL hood, the hood, not the RAP hood)
My friends, I will say it clearly (pair of slippers)
(My moms are fucking her ass) State my case
(Nigga, tomorrow I'm going to Japan!) What I'm sure of
(Do you understand what I'm saying? Can you believe that?)
I lived a full life (they have people waiting)
At the airport like five days like I'm a Beatle or something like that)
(That's really something!) And I walked each one, and each highway
(Seen the best of the best, the worst of the worst) and more
Much more than this (still here) I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
(Let's try this one, yeah!)
Nigga gangsta
Leave my hustle, broke the game, nigga
Jigga knocked down the doors of the Hall of Fame
I did it my way (and more ... much more than this)
That's right, it's a beautiful thing man!
(I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy) I did it my way - Hovi baby!
Younger and stronger summers and mom survivors like saunas
Dominate a corner like Deion in his uniform
Pop hurts assertive, flirted with death
Grandma's favorite she couldn't understand
How are there people in the world who don't want me as a neighbor
As a reminder that I do superior paper?
Black businessman, no one did us favors
The Rap Pack, I'm Sinatra, Sam Davis de Dame
Biggs the Smart Down as Dean Martin
Demanding all of you respect, hand over a check
And while they do, hand over the jet
They knew that every year I was launching a new product
The stock was increasing while I was building the Roc up
When the time came for us to go back up, make us billionaires
He-he-hee!
And more, much more than this; I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
I captured smaller cases, but I had capital
Hypocritical system, let me answer you
You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
Not even that scratches you, especially if you're black
They don't give a shit unless the defendant just raps
And they can look good by thinking of it as bad news
Because in my past, I saw guys who got half their views
Exposed to the sidewalk and no one said a word
When I saw how great my fight scene was at the club
Let me explain exactly what this shit was like
But it's great because we stand behind friends, it happened and it's over
It's in the past and I'm glad now I'm back to be Hova
Maybach with the driver, relaxed
Helicopter seat, feet tilted, shit like a sofa
Find me helicopter, Teterboro take me
So the next time page six approaches
Here's a quote from Jay, nigga. I did it my way.
And more, much more than this; I did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy
Nigga, I can make four more albums from memory!
You will never be better than me
I'm going to do this until I'm 80
Everyone wants to rhyme like Hov '
Because I rhyme like I'm rhyming on the Rov
Climbing on them hoes
Mind like a diamond, I'll blind you on the shows
I don't shine, shine, I remind you of that mass, right?
I did? Push the game with just the thought
Give me a boner, the trainer treats a coma
You can't rush a scammer, you can't beat a player
This rap shit is a trap
In my old business, motherfuckers sprayed you
In the music business, motherfuckers just say things
Spit on you and spray, yeah niggas, just play hard
When the cameras turn on, when the cameras go
Niggas wanna organize meetings
Because they most likely know when I see them. I'm ready for a beating.
Tinted windows, rimless cars
I haven't touched a wheel since I drove the Bent
So it was a coupe, no, I'm not puffed
You can't handle it, handle it nigga is what I do
I tried to be modest in Blueprint 2
You have to believe that I think like an artist
But my sky high bills can't do numbers like the Roots
Without disrespecting, I'm trying to disconnect
But the niggas keep on drawing me, I'm caught
My whole life is messy, and I just tidied up her living room
And you wonder why the chip on my shoulder is more like a brick or a rock
Maybe you will understand when you are older
Or what have you, niggas is back stabbing you
The press wants to know about Matthew's daughter
Now it's back to the hood again, all the black hood back
Go back to the old ladies saying what could have been.
Back to the gats: you forgot that I'm very good with them
They're gonna put a nigga in jail, oh well
If I can't do it, friend, it can't be done
I'm the only one, I'm not both, not all three, not all four, all five
I take the pain of my life, I spill it all
I used them to break down the door, I put my people inside
To entertain you, because that's not what I came to do
I'll hit you, I'll act like the orangutans do
I give you hot wings, turn niggas into angels
Understand my angle, first I'm safe
Don't make me act like security doesn't work
I'm giving the motherfuckers earth comforters
Night black night, take a land nap ...
I know you hear the steps ...
Here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers (this is not music)
I'm about to show you how a life of scammers (this is the man of life)
And the life of a soldier, parallel
And the only thing they have in common is a mother's pain
(Forget about me for a second)
Split screen image (forget about the musicians)
On the one hand we have a scammer preparing for the block (human beings)
On the other side you have the soldier (people) preparing for training camp (it's life)
The two are at war
Stay with us
You lost it mom, the war is calling
He is a soldier
He rose in rank as the head of his household
Now is the time to provide a bank, how it's supposed to
Now just remember why he left until November
His shirts absorb your tears as he hugs you
Your heart beats so fast that it accelerates its pulse
Yeah I know it sucks, life ain't all rosebuds
At training camp, worlds face terror
Bin Laden has been happening in Manhattan
The police were Al'Qaeda for black men
While I was out, fighting, sinning without religion
So don't worry, from what you see, it will pass
The years become "How the hell do we do it here?"
My headquarters fights average couple per day
Locking you in a hole won't see the light of day
And I feel like I'm just writing my life
For my team or my brothers, what is my reason for living?
I love my niggas more than anything else
This war is on my family, I need wealth
Until you become a 5-star general
P.O.W. he's still really at war, really
So don't worry, from what you see, it will pass
Your baby is growing
So your baby keep going
I have to chase him
And I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it
Yes your baby is growing
So your baby keep going
I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it
Even if I have to chase him
These wars cost you like Uncle Sam
It is death before dishonor
And if he's gone you should honor his memory
They're all winners for me, what's up Emory?
Come on ... life ... death ...
Here ... gone ... me
And when I'm gone don't cry, my niggas
Come on my niggas
When it's real, tell Shawn, my niggas
Don't cry my niggas it's been an incredible journey my niggas
I made unions with Mary J. Blige, my niggas
I've eluded the coppers, they ripped me off with Big Poppa
In high school, lockers took their heads
He gassed the meanest girl in class to show me his knockers
I never sit in the cell for a second, so they'll pay me bail
Sit in the county for summers if I'm depressed
All those around us become one for that day
To live life, do your shit right and play
Don't twist it like braids, if you miss me it's fine
But life is short, don't miss a day, uhh
If I died, don't cry, my niggas
Just travel, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
And when I'm gone don't cry, my niggas
Come on my niggas
When it's real, tell Shawn, my niggas
If I died ...
It has been a tremendous journey, my niggas
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't cry, my niggas
Just keep putting it on, my niggas
Say the word is a link, my niggas
Getting short like a stage actor
I had an episode with two lesbians, I got a fetish for it
Drunk ginseng with Japanese girls and plucked the root
Squeeze my entire clip to survive the shootings
Been on both coasts, shot all kinds of heat
I'm probably a little glad to leave these bad streets
I have demands to meet and questions to meet
How is that mystery real God?
And how was Kennedy assassinated?
I'm not mad i must have smoked a lot of pea coat
He drank Crowns with Latifah, broke the Geneva code
I know when I get to the other side, I will see the
Cat with beef with blood on my slipper
So it's on again, if I could be born again
I live my life through my son
Never shed tears, I cry liquor, my nigga
If I die don't cry, my niggas
It has been a tremendous journey, my niggas
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't cry, my niggas
Just keep hitting these songs, my niggas
Say the word is a link, my niggas
If I die...
Just stand tall, my niggas
Don't ask me why, my niggas
When I'm leaving alive, my niggas
Just go my way, my niggas
Say word in half, my nigga
Born to live forever through life's struggles.
Niggas seen expire right in front of me
Time could never repair what these cold streets
Mentally done to me, too often I close my eyes
And see my own coffin feeling haunted
Ready to leave this world I'm lost in
My only chance to see the seeds I lost from abortion
When I'm gone, all the niggas better not cry, keep flossing
As long as my name lives in what is most important
I will be in hell, scandalously preparing for life
The afterlife still haunts and draws attention to these microphones
It would rain for 40 days and 40 nights.
And I would return 3 as Christ
(Without my physical part)
My spirit is a safe poltergeist
I will return through the Heights tomorrow
Blood on all of you fake door niggas
What you thought, huh?
What did you think, nigga?
Just stand tall, my niggas
Don't ask me why, my niggas
Just go my way, my niggas
Say word in half, my nigga
When I die...
Say word to Wais, my niggas
When I'm gone don't cry, my niggas
Just keep putting it on, my niggas
Say the word is a link, my niggas
If I die...
... don't cry, my niggas
Just travel, my niggas, bust bullets in the sky, my niggas
And when I'm gone don't cry, my niggas
Come on my niggas
When it's real, tell Shawn, my niggas
If I died ...
I would tell Big that they are still listening to his songs
Is everything invisible gone?
I need to know, will I still be in pain or will it be ironic?
Will I relax in the flames from all the ills in my brain?
Can I re-sell the game to all scammers?
Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place?
Can I blow cigars and drink Cristal?
If this is heaven to me, is it considered heavenly?
Can I still touch lives, answer their "what and why"
Make sure everyone in my fam 'clutch five?
If I died ... don't cry, my niggas
Oh yeah
Tone hooker you
It's a beautiful thing you know
If you want it
We did it
If you want it
We got it (baby)
Now we have mystical visions of the street of making multiple Deniro
The mule makes the gods fly but we don't need another hero
As long as the gun brokers stand firm
I'm on a seven-day cruise stretched out, constantly flowing, rocking the boat
And the champaign made me feel haunting
My style made me spill liquor for niggas locked up on the island
Little brother could be the man soon
Live enchanting, lie down on a luxury sailing to Cancun
Mehico, you know the math boy we have cabbage
Let me go, let's take a break from all these wild wild streets
I burst the flow in places ????, I return in another day
So we can manage these limits in a better way and
This was how it had to be and the ladies are mad at me when
Word on the street the men who call me there majesty and
It must be true, I heard it from the Caribbean
Well i'm in love with the latest sexy black mohican
Remind me if it's not the bubbly, the Hennessy and
Recognize my wisdom then understand my street culture and
Redefine this powerful life from Europeans
Without strangling, I'm smoking potent paraphenelia
Ghetto Celeb save love, love
If you want it (baby)
We got it (baby)
We got it (baby)
We got it (baby)
If you want it (every night)
We got it (baby)
(Jay-Z: What the Fuck)
Roc-A-Fella gang, Suit Up
Until you die, get them looted
Do what you want, it's still in me.
When assets become liabilities
Try again with G
But feeling these
Bombard like Lebanese
Cheese forever
Great game, live my life like a movie
Until the last rain, dripping until I'm dizzy
Fat at $ 12.99 per CD
Jay-Z and Tone Hooker are ???
Blasting in the car
However, the glass made me think of more
Look out girl if I need it
I can't be stopped, I won't be defeated
I come to take your shit, you have to leave it
If I want it, I have the weapons for the player to execute
Birds no less than six digits from my mouth (uh-huh)
If I'm not platinum soon then you're back to the south (say what)
I'll build whatever it is they're back on set
I came to claim what I left because my name still represents
Except on screen (uh), Tryna exploits my flow
It's all, there's no time for the front
We make it happen, yeah we shut it down
Fuck you all want
To all of you guys laughing
Trying to play this money music
Trying to have it like the havers have
You know
I don't want it the way supporters want it
Get this cake and what not
But i will tell you what
Whatever he heads, you know, fighting
And I'm not trying to get money
Uhh, uhh, yes sir!
Only the sound of his voice is a success, hehe
You all niggas got me really confused
I make Big Pimpin 'or Give It 2 one of those
Everyone praises me as the best writer of the 21st century.
I do a little provocative thinking
Wondering if it's falling?
When the cups go down, the chicks go down
Like when the shots go off, get the cops to come
When the blocks come out, I can wake up a little town
I finish the block and then I do my shopping mall rounds
The looks are exchanged and then the fifth comes out
The tough guy disappears, then the bitch comes out
"That's him!", I'm usually what they whisper
Which girl are you with or the amount of chips?
Packing at the Ramada, table full of dust
A / C broke, about to take another shower in my 25th hour
Spike Lees everywhere, the game or the fight
You can see me anywhere, one day in life
Only thing changed the queue number on the flight
I can land and take off the same night
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't take the shit out of me
I'm so nervous, there aren't 6 in Sprees
Relaxed Maybachs, don't even talk to me
This is that ignorant shit that you like
Nigga fuck shit ass perch trick plus ice, come on
I have that ignorant shit that you love
Nigga fuck shit fagot bitch and drugs come on
I have that ignorant shit that you need
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like no front!
They are all actors, looking in the mirror upside down
They are all rare, De Niros in practice.
So don't believe everything that captures your earlobe
It's mainly the other way around, unless it's as accurate as I am
And everything said in the song you see
Nothing you hear even if it's spit on me
And with that said, I'll kill the dead niggas
Cut the niggas, give her leg wheels
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, I see you in hell
Shoot the niggas straight through the emergency room, wow!
This is not B.R., no, it is S.C., CEO
The next Lyor, no, the next leader of the whole free world.
And the first thing I will do is free Sigel, go ...
It's that ignorant nigga you love to hate
The '07 Ice Cube, B. Sig so rude
Tell a trick, get these nuts, eat cock for food
Now see if I care if this verse is transmitted
I'm so obscene, bitch, get off me
Keep my flea collar on, little ticks get out of me
I missed the part when it stopped being about Imus
What do my lyrics have to do with this shit?
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still, that's not to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
It's worse than these celebrations showing your kitty, you're kidding!
'Till we all sinless leave the pulpit'
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still, that's not to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Let's stop the shit
'Till we all sinless leave the pulpit' come on
This is that ignorant shit that you like
Nigga fuck shit ass perch trick plus ice, come on
I have that ignorant shit that you love

Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick more grass, come on
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like no front!
It's just entertainment! Hehehe
Uhh, uhh, yes sir!
You all niggas got me really confused
I do Big Pimpin 'or Give it 2 I get one of those
They greet me as the best writer of the 21st century.
I do a little provocative thinking
I will really confuse you all in this ... go on!
When the cups go down, the chicks go down
Like when the shots go off, get the cops to come
When the blocks come out, I can wake up a little town
The looks are exchanged and then the fifth comes out
The tough guy disappears, then the bitch comes out
"That's him!", I'm usually what they whisper
What girl has, or the amount of chips?
Because I've been doing this since CHiP came out
Looking at Erik Estrada
Packing at the Ramada, table full of dust
A / C broke, about to take another shower in my 25th hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game or flight
You can see me anywhere, one day in life
I can land and take off the same night
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't take the shit out of me
I'm so nervous, there aren't 6 in Sprees
This is that ignorant shit that you like
Nigga fuck shit ass perch trick plus ice, come on
I have that ignorant shit that you love
Nigga fuck shit fagot bitch and drugs come on
I have that ignorant shit that you need
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick more grass, come on
I'm just trying to give you what you want
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like no front!
They are all actors, looking in the mirror upside down
They can't even face themselves, don't fear the rappers
They are all rare, De Niros in practice.
So don't believe everything that captures your earlobe
It's mainly the other way around, unless it's as accurate as I am
And everything said in the song you see
So actually, believe half of what you see
Nothing you hear even if it's spit on me
And with that said, I'll kill the dead niggas
Cut the niggas, give her leg wheels
Shoot the niggas straight through the emergency room, wow!
This is not B.R., no, it is the CEO of S.C.
The next Lyor, no, the next leader of the whole free world.
And the first thing I will do is free Sigel, go ...
I got that ignorant shit you like, nigga
I got that gangsta shit you love
Nigga, bang out, brain, money and drugs
I got that ignorant shit you need, nigga
Hydro, Blueberry, Herb Bomb, Nigga
Nigga, OD drug demons, you love it don't face it!
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't take the shit out of me
I'm so nervous, there aren't 6 in Sprees
Relaxed Maybachs, don't even talk to me
When you're done, can you get out of my sight?
I built an ark, mommy, cry me a river
Blacken my heart by putting light liquor on the liver
Young Goldie, The Mack Forever
Said a G doesn't give a bitch no keys or security codes
I agree, my lady is not a bitch, she gets whatever I own
So when you see her, I understand it's me, nigga
I know the difference between a bitch and a B, black
... trick, get me out of me, you can't get shit out of me
This is that ignorant shit that you like
Nigga fuck shit ass perch trick plus ice, come on
Nigga fuck shit fagot bitch and drugs come on

I'm so nervous, there aren't 6 in Sprees
Relaxed Maybachs, don't even talk to me

Unstoppable (dynasty)
Young hova
I just want you to know (Hov ', I want to let you know)
It's not where I've been (It's not where I've been, Hov ')
But where am I going (top of the world! Young Hova, holla)
Now I just want to love you! (I just want to love you, Hov ')

But don't fuck with me
Come on, give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, those effusive things
Yeah uhh yeah
When the Remy is in the system, it is not known
Will I catch them? Will I reject them? That's what they're screaming
I'm a pimp of blood, no relationship
You are all chasing, I replace you, huh?
Drunk on Cris', mommy on E
I can't keep your little model hands away from me
Both in the club, tall, singing out of tune
"And I wish I had never met her!"
It is, about, go, down
I got six model girls, six bottles of Cris
Four Belvederes, they have grass everywhere
What do you say, me, you and your glasses Chloe (uh-huh)
Go to a private place where we can talk about fashion?
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra (ok)
Filth Mart jeans, take that off

Yes, save the narrative, save it for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you save it for carats
You wanna see how far i go
How much will I spend but you already know
Zip, scratch, stingy with money
I could buy you Cris', but that's it
I could light up your wrist, but that's it
Fuck it, I could handcuff you and buy you good whips
Ma, but you really have to ride a good cock
Make you shine like the sound of Neptune
Ok, hot Hov ', too hot to hold on
The ladies love me for a long time as the soul of 2Pac
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two-way paging me (come on)
Give it to me

But don't fuck with me
Come on, give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, those effusive things

Ro-mancin 'girls who dance with girls

You will be hunters, I will replace you, huh?
Drunk on Crist 'mommy in E

No, no, I just wanted to have a little fun
I love you too honey
I was being a bastard, sorry
My fault is my fault
Right now we are going to take a break from Armi, I hope you have some Armadale there for me.
Uh, I want to let my Questlove man introduce the entire gang, the Roots gang makes a very quick noise
I'll be right back

Give up once on Jay Z)

'I have to do one more, I can't just leave you like this
I may have to do this whole show, feel it? We are having a good time, I hope you are having a good time, you know what I am saying.
I love you too, you're embarrassing me for stopping that
Before i go...

(Baby you love ... HOV '!)
uh uh uh
She likes me
She leans on me
This is about lust
Cold sweats happen when I'm not with her
My presence is a must-must-must-
Pretty Applebum, I have to put you
If it didn't when we cut, the feeling will be too strong
Either way, I'm giving you sweet dreams
That Sugar Hill, she calls me sweet
Just for one night baby take me in vein
Now that feeling has you stumbling
You don't want to feel different
Open nose and it's leaking (huh, huh, huh, huh)
I know what you like, I am your recipe
I am your doctor, I am your addiction
(HOV '!)

I'm so dumb (uhh)
Like Louboutins with the red bottoms
You have to have them, you're glad you have them
Like all Giuseppe's colors, your guilty pleasure is me
It's so much fun, you avoid therapy
Although it never is, the feeling is fleeting.
Shopping is like attacking, you need it constantly
I'm never around, you're constantly looking for him
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12 steps
I keep trying to remind you to keep telling yourself
But when that medicine is felt
Never let them tell you that you'll never need me
My China White, until D.O.A
Montega forever, darling, let's escape ...
And I know and I know
And I know and I know

All you love, damn it!
(Baby you love ... HOV '!)
How could you leave me
I thought you needed me!
When the world got too much and you begged me
Who helped you immediately? How quick of me!
How could you deny me so vehemently?
And your soul is in control, trying to get it out of me
And your heart no longer promises me loyalty
Damn, I'm missing the days when you needed the D!
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
(Uhh, I know what you like)
And I know and I know
And I know and I know
(I know what you love)

He jumped like "ME! Who the hell are you with?"
Sparkle the jewels because that's the rule
Damn I like a girl who spends a little money for her shoes
Natural face: can I reach you?
I saw a stain on the body that looks good with a tattoo
With my name, but I didn't want to jump the gun
I didn't know how many niggas was humping baby
I said I've never seen a face like yours
And I've been around some pretty bitches before
That I or my children broke it before
So I hope you are different, I let you press 6 and
Give you a different life and a baby if that's right
Jump on it in the morning and ride until night
I want to buy you real jewelry when it comes to light
Bitches will momentarily lose their sight
She said
I know what they want
I know what the boys like
I know what they want
I know what kids like, kids like me
You want a girl with a booty like POW!
Deeper than a MILE! Earrings shine like TADOW!
But I'm a real bitch, so you know I do real things
Only real bitches live like queens, understand?
Security deposit in the dressing room
Marble taps and matching Rolls Royces
On the way in from Monday to Friday
I'm the richest, shitting on these bitches
As the chickens walk giving up their butts
I play the cut with Daddy Warbucks
You can call me a whore, who cares
That's good, black shit, I'm good with mine
I can tell by your shoes that you know what I want
Fuck a pre-nup, give me half in advance
My sex is the best, so we divide these costs
And start saying ours
I know what girls like, I'm a flying girl
I know what they want
They want me sex
I know what girls like, girls like me
I know what they want
They want me sex
I know what kids like, kids like me
Got the bomb place, John Blaze fireplace
Victoria Secret lingerie, ice like Don King
The price was like eight digits far away, shit
I have the oceanfront view, V1 too
Grab one, copy me one too
On-site, lakeside jet ski park
Invite your friends
Let them make their way between the Benzes and the Rovers
Get away for a week or more
First class here and there, going crazy
I have to have things closed, the champagne exploded
I can't complain, we're dancing, right or not mom?
I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like, girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like, girls like me
I know what the boys like
I know what they want
I know what kids like, kids like
I know what the boys like
I know what kids like, kids like me
I told you Mrs. Carter ... Here we are
(Mom, I did it)
You know how I do it, like DOC does, I fly it
This is how I operate (Mom, I did it)
Hurrah! Is the helpless now my feet
At the desk I am the presidential favorite
I can't believe I got away with it
My first stages to be on stage
I'm getting closer to the world, congratulations!
Your baby is a man made, I am a family hold like three generations
Remembering the basis you gave them
For repairing my relationship with my friends before I passed away
Toast to the most beautiful girl in the world
My inspiration thanks for the information.
Mom I did ... Mom I did
Outside in BK where
Not every day you make it
Be on top of the yachts waving
Now our dark cradle like basement
I had to lock the phone when you were not at home
We communicate as if the money you earned was not basic
Our cable was basic with no HBO, WHT, only Ralph McDaniels at the station
I bothered you by Atari and ColecoVision pinstripe Lee's
When the first day of school came
While on Saturdays you had the Commodores playing
The expression on your face is priceless
Even with me to this day, baby, I won't erase it
I go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made
You deserve a big ovation
Mom I did ... Mom I did
Now your little misfit, make sure it's Christmas every day, write your wish list
6's, the doll is shining, you don't even like jewelry
But you could lose yourself wherever you want
Where the waters are light blue, everything you ask for
Sign in your nice room, leave an extra tip, ma
Be extra nice to them
Carter Foundation CEO, wow!
I know Colleek somewhere in the clouds like
Go get 'em, Grandma, make me proud
I didn't have a man in the house, so you made one
So I act like your husband and I'm just your son
I told you that one day I would get you a home
I didn't know I could be in Rome.
He told me not to wait for anyone, get yours
So with me and my microphone, I made it
Mom I did ... Mom I did
Yes i mean like
I was busting that Crystal
Wearing that platinum shit
When all the girls thought it was silver and shit
(Imaginary playmates)
Bottom line (imaginary playmates)
I'll show you how to do it, check it out
I spit that other shit
That's a good motherfucker shit
That Fed time follows me, Deep Cover shit, nigga
Your beer money, I'm money all year
I'm "Daddy, you don't have to count it, it's all there" money
I never change money because blacks have strange money
NARC'd, dialed, fucked up in the game money
I spit the hottest shit, you need it I got it shit
I have blood money, thugs money
You have dough to display, little or no dough
Sell a bunch of records and you still owe mass
I have 900 and 96 plus 4 months of dough
You're crazy, fleeting, I'm crazy with papo dough
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
And now you have these young cats acting like caps
All in silly raps, talking about how they stack the funds
When I see them on the street, I don't see any of that.
Damn playboy, where the hell is the Hummer?
Where's all the ice with all the platinum underneath that?
Those are not Rolex diamonds, what the fuck did you do with that?
You all niggas rappers, you guys are funny to me
You're selling records being you, but you still want to be me
I guess for every dollar you make it's like a hundred to me
And you keep running thinking you have something on me
But I did it
And everyone wants to take my flow and run with it
That's great i was the first one with that
Sit down, I don't want you to get confused
I break it, like I have nothing to lose
(Do you understand now?)
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Groupies I leave them all screwed up; Niggas, amazement hit
Your single was 99 cents, mines were $ 4
Last year when niggas thought everything was ready
Nigga stop complaining, Jigga, keep shining
Niggas kept complaining so I picked up more diamonds
I still throw t'ree in your body, running away from the party
They can't go with me, no, they flow with me
Bet 50, not dollars either, I brought some dough with me
I flow like Series 5, in several areas.
And make holes in your weak theories of niggas
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
Imaginary playmates
I mean, be honest, man: how do you think you will feel, right?
You arrive in your 4.0 with your bitch
I stop at 4.6 with my bitch with the back of the seat
Hit some other shit, you know, some OTHER shit
Ask me some stupid shit like
"Me, me dog, what's the difference between a 4.0 and a 4.6?"
Like 30 to 40 billion, motherfucker, hit it! Haha
Me, those shits even have hides?
Guru turn this shit on (OW!)
I know a million people have already done this
Let's do it a billion
OG I'm going in! (bounce)
Big Bizzle, happy birthday my nigga!
Geah, a billi, a billi, a billi, a billionaire
Call me Philli Collins, I feel like a billion are in the air
And John Meneilly-onaire is my consigliere
When I wear Billionaire Boys Club, it's more than clothes
I don't use it because Pharrell, I use it because I'm real
(I see dead people)
I'm a born swindler, son of a bitch from Marcy Projects
He became a professional journalist reporting, live from the gutter
Where the girls carry box cutters
Brothers shoot in underwear
Screaming "Fuck the world!" Why? Because nobody loves us
Shawn Carter, Sean Bell, what's the difference? You say
50 shots or 50 mill ', no difference go to hell
So, BRRRAK, lick a shot for, BRRRACK Obama, change gon 'come or
I'm going to buy all the flame from the hood
Whatever it is, at three
Declaring, I'm free, bumping into Pac and the outlaw
I'm flying that everything outdoors, I come out strong
I buy, champagne companies, I don't buy bars anymore
But I flew, back and forth like Aaliyah (Rest in peace for you)
Take a nation of millions to stop us
But when your kid hits a billion it's a wrap (out of RAP?) YES!
Roc Nation it takes a nation to stop
I am closing the session, it is Barack, BRRRACK.
Son of a bitch, I'm sick!
What's up baby (oooh!)
I thought I had to talk to you again, missing you (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Tim misses you, Missy misses you
Your pop misses you, give me misses you
Damn, we miss you ... WOO !!!
4-page lyrics, plus
Have you ever loved someone who used to blow up the party?
We were The Breakfast Club, you were part of the ROC
We used to make up special names for the food we ate
Well, Dame told me to tell you that it's okay
But I don't have to tell you that you're watching us
Our little angel, but you know what
Brooklyn misses you, Detroit misses you
New Orleans misses you, Philly misses you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Your fans miss you, Valerie misses you
Damn, we miss you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Now Star is mad, I won't give her an interview.
Now it's bothering me, because it has bothered you
Can you believe this guy's nerve?
Because from your memory I will not bring it to the pistols
(Wondering if you are the same and who has been with you)
But I know that God protects you
You used to read Seat Of The Soul, I know God is perfecting you (I miss you)
All the extra shade, the darkest texture you are
The more intellectual you are
Too good for the land that you are (me, miss, you)
Houston misses you, Los Angeles misses you
DC misses you, Chicago misses you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Kidada misses you, Chak 'misses you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
We feel your presence just not physically
Around the world, blocks are miserable
But they are not original or identical.
I swear on hip hop if it's not ten of you
Then it must be more, you left your legs
Traces in the game, the hood has not been the same
Feeling that it has not been in the music, the hooks have not been the same
But I'm doing what I can, man
Trying to follow all of you down the path of memory, man
And it shows how much niggas really miss you
Left eye, we miss you, Jay, we miss you
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah, Scott La Rock, the list goes on
The world misses you, the hood misses you
(Wondering if you are the same and who has been with you)
No, I mean, I miss you all (I miss you)
Soldiers and vendors, all over the world (I miss you)
We will hold them down, living in our memories forever
We will never let them go
No, I can't think, no, more (although we don't remember death!)
Since you left (we are celebrating your life, no!)
I really don't feel like talking, I don't want to hear that you love me
Baby (yeah!) Do you understand me (yeah, yeah, yeah!)
I can't do anything without you (damn it, we miss you)
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you, I miss you
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you, I miss you
This song here is dedicated to Danny Dan, may he rest in peace
Who at his funeral left us with the words that
While niggas are stupid I'm carefully plotting
Ways to make it rotten, well-planned punches until you forget about it for a long time
You all niggas who use my style don't hurt me
Cause in the low half of these nigga rappin 'ass they wanna work for me
Now imagine me standing on someone blocking trying to rock
While you're looking at my black cock, give me yours
I don't bother with the capsules, because that will make the herb grow
If I risk a pat down, wrapping my wrists in steel
I'm here trying to make a mill ', my shit is real for real
While others love guns, I adore tons of money
Lots of fun, laughing at things that aren't even fun
So I'm not pressured to make a CD, I took it easy
In my life I need to see a lot of mass
I need a lot of dough
In my life, I need to see a lot of hiding
In my life I need to see a lot of mass
I need a lot of dough
In my life, I need to see a lot of hiding
I need a lot of cash
More ice than winter '94
I toured all 50 states with a log of crude
Recruiting, I'm hitting the shorties on consignment but don't play with me
I'm reclining on the five thousand-seat Italian leather recliner
Beneath a little vagina, discussing the finer things
Letting shorties slip from time to time and dream
They think I've mastered the game, because the ladies scream my name
I passionately tell them to stop blinking and start hiding
And we will all leave the corner, the only heat you will feel
And fucks that weed, keeps you bankrupt, invests in
Pounds of herbs and gains if niggas want to smoke dope
But stay crazy, because this is a man's game
And we will all make champagne until it's too bad
In my life, I need to see a lot of hiding
I need a lot of cash
In my life I need to see a lot of mass
I need a lot of dough
In my life, I need to see a lot of hiding
I need a lot of cash
I'm shooting Las Vegas, playing the green at the casino
Teaching the Dice as Vinny Barberino
Welcome back, the '95 version of The Mack
As soon as these ladies see me they don't know how to act
Because like that, nigga, never twist the lid on the malt liquor
Just explode and drop Cristal down my throat, take a drink
You're shooting with a professional with money to fly boy
Unfold a bundle of bills, grab my balls and then bet
On the block you are lucky if you see my silhouette
I'm a ghost, envied by most
So I keep a team of crazy tenants that are toast, you bastard
In my life I need to see a lot of mass
I need a lot of dough
In my life, I need to see a lot of hiding
I need a lot of cash
In my life I need to see a lot of mass
I need a lot of dough
In my life, I need to see a lot of hiding
I need a lot of cash
Skiing, Roc-a-Blok Productions, uh-huh, uh-huh
Give me Dash, ha ha, Roc-a-fella Records, uh huh
Salsa Dinero, Grand Sergeant, B Alta
DJ Clark Kent, everyone Uptown
Best Out, my V-A clique is getting thick
D'Shawn definitely in the house
Roughness, that's how we do it
"In my life"
"In my life"
It is the idea of a trip that opens my eyes, I am trapped
I'm trying to make all my dreams come true, so
I found a new route, you're about to see my life change
I make the means justify the ends
I make the cream, I materialize the keys of a Benz
And then I'm rolling
For now, holding the fort, who is controlling?
Earth has to blow them up, yeah everyone should have told them
Uhh, my first crime is coming
I bought a black MAC, I'm out of control
Losing bankrolls in blackjack, you have to know
I always cross my mind
Let the feds touch the lines like Gregory Hines
Still my blood is flowing ice, it's just my life, huh
"In my life"
"In my life"
I'm like the bass with the ass, splashing cash
Is it just a mirage that all these girls thank God for?
Is this world my world? Am I the star of the stars?
Baby excited I'm getting too big and smoking cigarettes
All the girls are screaming about Jig-ga, the whole city is buzzing
I wasn't checking in a dozen or so months ago
Now I'm all they know, I'm a person (yeah)
Let the crystals breathe in the Barnacle Bar
Under my sleeve, vernacular, 50 G's
Uhh, hurry up like you don't believe
My head is about to explode, speeding up what drives me
I hope I don't have to die to see, see, I can't lie
I know the price, I know the risk, I know the errors and the rights.
Still my blood is flowing ice, it's just my life
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
"In my life"
"In my life"
Uhh, from the beginning, look, we never saw the end
Running on all the women, all the clothes, all the jewelry, huh?
We sported Pelé, gold diamonds and Pirelli.
But that's great, while I'm at Al Capone, look at me
Because the head of the Medusa in Versace turned me to stone
Bones are disconnected like phones.
Like the garden, all my pen pals control the warden's life.
I could do it in real time, I am a prisoner of my crimes.
Know the price, know the risk, know the errors and the rights.
Now I am imprisoned for my life
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
"In my life"
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
"In my life"
"In my life"
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
"In my life"
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
"In my life"
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
What is the meaning, what is the meaning of life?
"In my life"
"In my life"
The other night, when I was researching what was going to be discussed today, I came across a written passage, I think it really exemplifies what the little brother next to me was talking about and learned that everything must end.
It is an inevitable part of the cycle of existence, all things must end
That came before
That came before
That came before
"Man, I worked for one of the largest companies in New York City
He did not own his own company.
(Your gangster is undefined)
Your gangster is not defined by how low your jeans fall around your waist, but rather how your genes resist his expectations.
"Never forgetting where we come from."
(Your gangster, your gangster)
Your gangster is undefined by how many rocks are on your watch
Labor conservators
The seller, the buyer, the product, the producer.
"You see that you are what you are in this world."
The gangster is absorbed and adored by those who do not understand the laws that govern the gangster.
(Gangsterment, gangsterment)
Gangsterment allows you to invent your own laws
And create new words, gangster mentality
Dominated by black and absorbed by demons.
Taxed by governmentality, governmentality (governmentality)
Plotted by Forbes, if you believe in Jay-Z
So you can also be a gangster), then you can also be a gangster
By whatever means necessary, possessing that dream
I mean it's a long way to freedom
But, while deep, deep, deep inside the bush
(The war on terror screams, damn, it feels good)
Damn it feels good to be a gangster haha
(To be a gangster, arrogance is not an obligation, it is a responsibility
A cliche, a bad suit, cut the shit
You know, if it wasn't for this, there wouldn't be that)
What we call, the American gangster
Someone is pulling me closer to the ground
I'm not panicking, I've been here before
It seems like yesterday when I woke up on that stage
In front of that crowd
And showed them who was who and what was what
Man look at these fools
I'm not a rapper, I'm a scammer
I happen to know how to rap
One million
Fucking, right? Ha, I know
I know what you niggas wonder
Are you ever going to fall?
... a lot of speculation
About the money I've made, the honors I've killed
What is he really like? Is that black really paid?
Is it true that you stayed in the meat and slept with a TEC?
What is the position you have?
Can you really match a platinum artist triple dollar for dollar?
If Roc-A-Fella bends, and you stay out in the cold
Is it going to charge motherfuckers 11 for an O?
For the millionth time, asking me questions
Like Wendy Williams, harassing me
While I'm watching my ice Rol 'spinning on my sleeve
Ugh, good watch, do you really have a place?
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so what block?
What are you doing in Los Angeles, with Filipinos and Eses?
Latinos and Chevys, down by Pico con Frederico
I will answer all your questions, but then you must go
Now the question I ask you is: "How much do you want to know?"
BLAOW!
One million
Roc-A-Fella you guys, uhh, uh
Know my style
Motherfuckers can't rhyme anymore, about crime no more
Until I'm gone, because I'm so raw
My flow exposes the holes they find in yours
It wasn't for me, niggas still dying for whores
But I hate when a nigga sits, admiring yours
Blacks don't want to just ride the iron horse
It used to be OT, applying force
Shoot the whole block, then the iron I throw
He returns with the clique that plays Diana Ross
I'm the boss and that's how it's going to be
I have mouths to feed until they put flowers on me
And he kisses my cold cheek, the girls cry like I'm Cochise
Tombstone said: "There was no leakage"
On MTV, telling them how I sold D
And I used to pack work outside the 4-B apartment
Me and my friend, we started co-d's
I chose the mailbox lock because I don't have a key
I had the cable with the anchor when Jaz did 'Sophie'
Then I was discreet, but now I'm back, it's on
Motherfuckers!
Jigga, uh-huh, yeah
Roc-A-Fella you guys, uuuh
Uhh feel this
Sorry guys
But all the money in the world couldn't bring me back again
Lie down lie down
I'm going to stretch my microphone at the Ponce Funeral Home in Marcy
But much later than a whole gang thought
The last of the real scammers, well, maybe not the last
Bleek is going to be a good rapper
New and improved Jay-Z: I quit
Sorry big i tried honest
However, I cannot accompany myself on this journey, I am making the decisions
The bar is closing, where are we going to have breakfast?
Roc-A-Fella you guys - OK, I'm recharged!
"Bringing the drama"
"Add a couple of dollar signs to my name" "Roc-A-Fella you"
"One of the best!"
"Waiting for my day to come"
No, this is not Jigga, it's your little nigga Bleek
Reporting to these motherfuckers they live from the street
At nine o'clock I used geese hoes for Easter clothes
Peep the steez, I represent for all those
At 28 grams, in an appearance trying to drag the keys
Big niggas told me to park the car, keep the keys
Find a hood and drag Mickey D's
Shoot two bullets first, niggas know I throw it
Niggas trying to kill me dog, who wouldn't?
I turned on the EJ, splitted Dutch with my ring finger
You find a bitch who owes me cream, bring her
Last seen with Bing, he dropped between us
Johnson and Johnson for nonsense, who wants it?
I'm going to sleep with a photo of a Porsche on my wall
Man I'm trying to reach everyone, get one for you all
That is why I rush into these streets from sunset to sunrise in all of you
Mama said keep lying, they'll kill you dead
A week of this hustle brought a parlor game
I went to Tom D's, crazy niggas, veins
He copped the Jordan, two weeks before they left
Curious bitch on the third floor like "Why little nigger?"
Bitch please twist the trees
It took a long jerk like a bitch to breathe
That's my answer, life is like cancer
"Waiting for my day to come"
"Just give me the word"
Jay-Z, Marcy, Brooklyn
Representing the, what, what
Roc-A-Fella you for life
Stretch Armstrong
Bring the noise haha
You know how we get depressed
Uh, the Roc-A-Fella boss, unflappable
Test my weight on the apple
It's never about if, but when you're gonna die like cattle
Beef, I'm going so hard, you swear, I love it
Is that so difficult to learn?
My burner gives niggas permanent heart murmurs
My crew endangers
Distant diverse niggas
Left in troubled waters like Greg Louganis
Or wherever your cats fuck rest, dead that
Last time you saw us, niggas appeared on Beamers
Or is it Soulshocker, Jigga Niggademus
Killer writing, not a word of it to your liking
Since we make you hate loving him like Prince
Until a nigga sits up straight like Bill Gates
Or feel a thousand and eight, let's pour out hate, in the filtering
To die! It's your destiny, realize how great
Get your helmets, professionals rockin ', nigga, hold on
Time is everything, everything that shines is not gold
There are diamonds on each ring, what the fuck!
Boggsy Bogues style, now a bigger black than Shaq
Cradle in the cat, skills, living life
Chickens that used to act bad
A bitter black so when a black hits you believe (Ugh)
I'm trying to hurt your stomach like ten thousand abs (Yes)
Jigs, baby, what is it! Just as casual
Yeah uh-huh yeah
Every time, you (Roc-A-Fella, you)
What, what, Jay-Z, uh (what, yeah, yeah)
Yes, yes, Roc-A-Fella you (Marcy)
Yeah yeah uh-huh
(Let these niggas know)
West coast niggas, man
Getting off the line, man
Watch your step haha
Fuck
I, react, biatch nigga
I think they can fuck with the rich black
Niggas fags, don't play with yours, my team will kill yours
Naysayers, I can't screw, we put yours
With our hands up, shit, I swear to God
Since money is respected, you know I had to get it
Because too many bastards tried to keep going
He is not selling any records, is he? That nigga has to hurry
Shit, you can bet your guns, either way, I got mine
You step in, anyway, I do
For real
Uh, don't be mad at me
I don't love them, I fuck them
I don't chase them, I dodge them
I replace them with another
You had to see that she kept calling me B.I.G
And my name is Jay-Z
She will be all on my cock
Little by little I'm taking care of your bitch
Coming on your shit
You come home to wash dishes and soda cans
I got your bitch on my man Rover
I never kiss her, I never take her hand
I'm a pimp, man over
(Man is over, man is over ...)
Is that your bitch? Why is she all in her six?
With his hand on his cock he continues to lick her lips
Is that your bitch? Why did she do everything on her walk?
With his hand on his thighs he continues to look him in the eye
While you guys are on your grill, don't you know that man kills?
Is that your bitch? Why is she looking for him?
Keep praising him? Because it's Jay and them, bitch!
Room 112, hotel balcony
How does Jay say you can call the house for me?
There is no respect at all
You should check his daughter
She keeps begging me to hit him raw
So she can have my kids and say it was yours
Shit, I put the rubber tighter
He sent her home when she entered
You hugged her
What the hell is going on
She flogged you, your children
I have your house, but that's not your bitch
You share that girl, don't let them hear that she'll throw
It will make them sick that their favorite girl
I'm not saving you, cheating bitch
Is that your bitch? Why is she all in her six?
With his hand on his cock he continues to lick her lips
With his hand on his thighs he continues to look him in the eye
Is that your bitch? You better tell her the cold
While you guys are on your grill, don't you know that man kills?
Is that your bitch? Why is she looking for him?
Keep praising him? Because it's Jay and them, bitch!
Cool off friend
You must keep her away from my clique
Keep her out of the nightclubs, all in the mix
Going out with girls who swallow cocks
Hot boy like Jigga Man singe your bitch
Play all four points, Jigga Man goes first
So we all rock until we're all hot
You know that the Roc boy has the whores locked up
I got the bitches on success
Make drawers fall fast
Why do we get more cash than the average black?
All of them hoes like "Damn, I have to have this nigger"
Because I'm black, how the hell can you stop that?
You would fuck mine
I'm only playing the chosen cards
Is that your bitch? Why is she all in her six?
With his hand on his cock he continues to lick her lips
Is that your bitch? Why did she do everything on her walk?
With his hand on his thighs he continues to look him in the eye
Is that your bitch? You better tell her the cold
While you guys are on your grill, don't you know that man kills?
Is that your bitch? Why is she looking for him?
Keep praising him? Because it's Jay and them, bitch!
Jigga and Twista made them scream
Like a devilish devil by the semen
Shimmering Chrome as the Keenan Dome
Gone while I'm smoking
Your bitch on the passenger side of me showing your money
You know he's been flirting while you work
Behind the curtain knuckles shaking safely
Poppin 'that pussy
Sweating until there is no liquid
When I walk into the party with Jay, we gon 'do it to death
You're going to ruin your reputation
Trippin 'while you pimp these heifers
The Beach Conferences made me shine like a new Gator stepper
Must have been angry
When you put my things on the board
To reach the climax a blow occurs to me
Legitimate ballers folding the block
Niggas running, coming at us for their status and accessories
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put the cock inside her
Is that your bitch? Why is she all in her six?
With his hand on his cock he continues to lick her lips
Is that your bitch? Why did she do everything on her walk?
With his hand on his thighs he continues to look him in the eye
Is that your bitch? You better tell her the cold

Keep praising him? Because it's Jay and them, bitch!

1-900-Hustler, Sigel, holla your boy
What is the shorty problem?
Yes man
I'm the only Brooklyn nigga here, man
I'm trying to close the place, holla to me
Good; wait - Hova, line one
Here are a couple of suggestions on how I could perfect it.
You find a guy in town, send him a short message
But I got a soft white that will surely turn brown again
I get that butter all night
Because most blacks don't know a brick from a bite
They keep buying hard white
And if you break free tomorrow night, we can meet and discuss the price.
Or - you find a girl, shit, you lock yourself in her crib and
Shake hands, make friends like it's all innocent
So before you look, you sell to cook in the city
Or, cool gorilla, come with that murderous shit
Take a black brick, hit it and then you sell it
Yeah yeah that's gangsta i think i'm going to shoot with that
Write a check for eight hundred dollars
Niggas take too long with that cash advance and that shit
Let me holla someone real
Bleek line two
Listen little, you want to roll just give me the word
I don't have time for a prayer, all that shit is absurd
First you find a strip, if you don't cook, first find a bitch
If you don't rush, find a nigger who casts first
You're new in town, not red and blue in town, that's gang
The strong movement is silent, the weak begin riots
We know you have a brick, but sell them twenty until they get tired
No credit, you know you're sick of it, you gotta eat a fetish
And other niggas that get it - DEAD
Make them an offer they can't refuse
It resists, encases it, until it can't be moved
Here are the rules: chop it, pack it, save it, stack it
Come in, come out, that's an O.G classic.
900-Hustler, you pass it
{* click *, * dial tone *}
I have two bricks
It was on hold for about two hours, nigga
{* click *, * plays classical music *}
This shitty elevator music
First things first, see what you say through your mouth
Never play house, think about drought, keep warm on the sofa
When you sit in the presence of customers
If a nigga ever thinks he's touching you
Lie down, get cake, whip the whole state
Save the dough, beat yay with the correct amount of baking (ho!)
Nigga too close went home (me!)
You stop the dough when we catch the gas
I know you heard "Friend or Foe", this is no different from that
Make sure you have your four and four and he can slip if he wants
Young, Jon Benet missing daughter tonight and I
Until you stay away from the dice and the whores
Three smuts, two straights and a dyke
Because kids want three packages, two stripes, and pipes for sure
And if it's tight then I could come back for more
Nine-four, every day round trip
Winter to Summer, 1-900-Hustler
I'll tell you how to weigh the wet shit and pack more
Two E, will be two G
And forget my money, I'm going for all your kis, nigga
{* click *, * dial tone *}
You talk all reckless on the phone
Get-Indicted-Hotline or something motherfucker?
I know I used to speak recklessly about two chickens before
You get it, you know, two chickens? But listen
I'm just pushing half a wing back, nigga, Holla
{* click *, * dial tone *}
My first brick did it
I knew I was addicted when I changed it to four
Then I spanked him more
And it's what the streets call you:
"How could you leave me after all I did for you?
Who else would employ you? I made you feel real
All it took was a little oil, a little water
My first taste of power, I'm numb to feeling
I'm done niggas I can't stop trying
Shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot
Aren't you afraid of going to jail? God
Well, use your brain, are you sane?
But like Dale Earnhardt, the game runs through my veins
And I crash every time, but like I never hit the wall
I need the K's like Pedro, so I'm back throwing crude
And when the bases are loaded and the police try to tighten the game
The game is not cold enough to freeze Jay
And I, I need green as hell I need yay '
And they say it's not right, but it's the game of life
I'm addicted to gambling
Now I rap, as well
I smoke well, I drink well
Billionaire but I still think about the hood
I guess it's just the need to be heard
I need niggas to say, "I can't believe your words"
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Thoughts are sporadic, I have to confuse it
Something like a Rubik's cube is
Each album is a color, but I shit on the other, color
Ha, I guess I'm more like
A bitch with a belly but her butt is right haha
Still don't understand me
I will never enjoy my success, but my family will
So rap Jerry Rice is back
To satisfy the need, even though I lead the league
I pray every day, I travel at the speed of God
Not a minute slower because the minute Hova
Everyone prays that your spinach slows down
Holding my breath because the force that controls my step
Until I'm one with the music
Till I'm dead and gone, searching for the perfect song, mon mon
I'm addicted to gambling
Shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot
Uh, letter to my dad that I never wrote
Words on a paper that I never read
The prose never written, stayed in my head
Annotated in dotted lines, "I'm going to fight you, black"
From the stories I heard, I'm just like you, nigga
Should it be the energy that passed through
Must have been a pastor, many problems
Started a good man, you married my mom
It was in her belly, you rushed that summer
She had two children from a previous lord
A family, I don't believe in stepsisters
I remembered the many lessons when we went out
Did you see the runt as the favorite?
What ancestors did you summon to the summit?
To give me what I needed, what you need to take away
The tsunamis I swam to become
I had the cable with the anchor for the places where I sank
Unc in a better place but you couldn't work
You want to make God laugh, just tell him your plans
Who would have thought that it would be the father that I never had
Be the husband I've become, usually nothing comes
I forgive you while I live the beautiful present of the past
What were you preparing for us?
By?
All was a dream
I felt so real to myself, this is what was said
"I had a dream," I told him; "About who?" he said
"About B.I.G." I said; "That is great," he said.
"Dig what he said"; "Proceed," he said
"Actually," I said, so breathe, I did.
"Don't repeat what I say", I said, he said nothing
What I think is a yes, I repeated what was said
"It came to me like a whisper last night" I said
"What's the deal, playboy?" was the greeting he said
The first thing he wanted to know was the reason why he was dead.
"Mo 'Money Mo' Problems," "Better believe it," he said.
"Be careful what you wish for, you could receive it," he said.
"I see", I said, "jealousy" I said
"I have the whole industry mad at me," I said.
So B.I. said: "Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed it yourself! "
Getting high every day like Jesus did
"What he said," I said, "has been said before."
"Just keep doing your thing," he said; "Do not say more"
Was it all a dream? tell me
Was it all a dream? It was a dream?
I have to know (it was all a dream)
Was it all a dream? It was a dream?
Was it all a dream, a dream?
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D in the limo
Every Saturday Rap Attack Mr. Magic Marley Marl
I let my tape swing until my tape exploded
Smoking marijuana and bamboo, drinking private stocks
A long time ago when I had the red and black lumberjack
With matching hat
Remember to rap duke, "duh-ha, duh-ha"
You never thought hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the spotlight because I rhyme loudly
Time to collect, exploit like the (World Trade)
Born a sinner, the opposite of a winner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky
I'm exploding like you thought I would
Call the crib, the same number, the same hood, everything is fine
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Was it all a dream? tell me
Was it all a dream? It was a dream?
I have to know (it was all a dream)
Was it all a dream? It was a dream?
Was it all a dream, a dream?
Was it all a dre-eeee-eeeee-eeam
"I see", I said, "jealousy" I said
So B.I. said: "Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed it yourself! "
"I agree", I said, "my only me"
Getting high every day like Jesus did
"What he said," I said, "has been said before."
"Just keep doing your thing," he said; "Do not say more"
It's not me
I'm a ... I'm a ... I'm a
I'm a scammer scammer
The gangster of a gangster
I'm the rapper of a rapper
Your favorite isn't me
It's not me, it's not me, it's not me
I'm still winning and I'm not even close to finishing
It's just the first entry
They all hate me, all atheists
All security is at risk
One and only Hov
So when the story is told, let's say I refuse to double
I defended the best, I had no debts
I stand for the hood to my last breath
I took a pay cut to become an executive
And even though these niggas talk greasy about me
Ask these niggas how they gonna eat without me
Ask these niggas if they want stats involved
And even if they don't like me, they respect God
I'm the Hustler poster, I'm supposed to be combing
I have nothing to prove, I'm supposed to smile
I'm not insecure, I'm invested in a piece of Carol's daughter
I'm in sephora
Bricks are insignificant to him.
Take your baby's money and burn it, T-Ha
I have Warhols on my living room wall
I am such a sophisticated hood, premium cashmere S. Carter products
A thousand dollars for the sneaks
G4 back and forth to my seats on the floor
Everything you aspire to, I have to acquire
Whatever weapon you say you fired
I'll shoot any kind of paraphernalia, I'm the seller
I guess you're saying this is how I started Roc-A-Fella
Federals all fed up
DEA can't tell dirty money from a Rocawear sweater
Oh never that, oh never that
I'm in the twelve step program
I haven't touched drugs in a long time, I'm a sober man
I'm clean as a whistle, officer
I have a way, I am the King of all kings, it is official
I'm a scammer scammer
The gangster of a gangster
Your favorite isn't me
It's not me, it's not me, it's not me
Oh
I keep you cooler than the next girl
You don't need to ever sweat the next girl
With speed, I make the best girl see the exit indeed
You get the keys to the Lexus, driverless
You have your own 2001 to travel
And keep your butt tight at Versace, that's why
You have to look at your friends, you have to look at me
They test me, all they get is 50 cents franc
And papayas, from town to TV.
It's time to kill him in your belly without a doubt
I have more chicks between my sheets than Essence
Laughing, my thing is tight
Let me hear you all
There's no nigga like the one I got

(Keeps you in diamonds and fur)
Hahaha
Tell the monsters to find a man of their own
Own man, own man
Fox Brown ..
Yes, Jay-Z, what?
I keep it cooler than the next one, bitch
You don't ever need to sweat the next bitch
You should know that you are completely respected by me
You got your own '96 something to ride
And keep your butt tight at Versace, that's why
Shit, the first chance to break the bank, they test me
All they get is 50 cents franca and papayas
From town to TV
Still hitting on my other life
Laughing, my shit is tight, who are you asking, right?
There's no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
Sleep but it gives me a lot
(Keeps you in diamonds and fur)
(Tell the monsters to find a man of their own
Own man, own man)
Yes Yes Yes
Cool to death in Mo-schi-no, coach bag
I got you a pager to feel important
Surrounding your feet in Joan & David and Charles Jourdan
I keep you dove, but love
Everyone knows how it goes, B, so I crawl
I've been sinning since you've been playing with Barbie and Ken and
You cannot change a player's game in the ninth inning
So I run to shit on them
And wrinkles face like linen
It keeps it real, Jigga stays tough. "
Lord don't even stumble shit I never slip
There's no nigga like the one I got
(No one can fuck you better)
(Keeps you in diamonds and fur)
(Tell the monsters to find a man of their own
Ha ha right right
I promise to stay monogamous, I try
But, love, you know these hoes are making me weak
Everyone knows how it goes, B, so I stay deep
How are you, boo? Just keep me entwined with the smallest snakes
Mackin 'this bitch, nigga wife
So when you turn that coke around
But now your style and I raised you, basically I made you
In a gift, turning weight, her-on and shit
You know that pussy is all of that
That is why I get baguettes, 5 carats and all that.
From Dolce Gabbana to H Bendel, I'm ringing bells
Especially when I'm drinking Baileys
You don't care how you move with them other moms
I push the Z, eating garlic prawns with rocks bigger than life
Fuck them, Reebok, you let them know who your wife was.
I have you in front of Armani sweaters
And classes E with Mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali with all the flavor of ante Bally's
High message, I swear you're killing me, playing inside my pubic hairs
I never care about them other girls
Because you proved who your magician was
When you were spending that bitch
How do you live big on the island?
Everything he collects bothers me, but when you come home
I knew I was going to get half of those checks
Now we're on the rise
Your diamond mommy with slanted eyes
Keeping this grip, I tilted the En Glee-Kay and that shit
I made you a star, pushing hundred-thousand-dollar cars
Sleep but it gives me a lot
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Own man, own man)
I keep it cooler than the next bitch
It's not necessary ... so you never sweat the next bitch
... with speed I make the best bitch see the way out ... actually
You have to know that you are respected by me
You get the keys to the driverless Lexus
You got your own '96 suh on ... the ride
And keep your butt tighter than Versace, that's why
They conspire shit
The first opportunity to break the bank
They test me, all they get is 50 cents franc
And papayas, from town to TV.
It's time to kill him in your belly without a doubt
I have more black girls between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Still pounding in my life after ...
Laugin my shit is tight
You who ask well ...
Chorus
There's no nigga like the one I got
Sleep but it gives me a lot
Keeps you in diamonds and fur
Friends will tell me that I should leave you alone
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
(Man they own, man they own)
Cool to def on my skeeno
Black and filipino fakin no jacks medium lookin coach bag
I got you a pager to feel important
Surrounding your feet at Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan
I keep you dove but love
You know these are making me weak
Yall knows how it goes, so I crawl
I've been sinning since you played with Barbie and Ken in
Twist chrome trim keeps them smiling
So I run to shit on them
And wrinkle your face like linnin
I play hard until God say ...
Lawd doesn't even stumble
I never slip, nigga, what you don't see is what you get
Hidden weapons what everyone feels
-What is the deal-
I, there is nothing to stop this, there is no lie
I promise to stay monogamous, I try
But love, you know these are making me weak
Yall knows how it goes so I stay deep
What's up, just keep me intertwined with the illa snakes
Bank rolls and shit, massages in the French tubs
Makin 'this bitch nigga wife
So when you turn that coke around
Remember those days that you were dead broken
But now your style and I raised you
I basically made you a gift
Flippin weight ... heroin and shit
You know my pussy is all of that
So they give me 5-carat bagets and all that.

Shows in Cali with all the flavor of ante Bally's
Now all your men in your benz
High message, I swear you will kill me

How you live big on the island
Everything he collects bothers me

Now we're on the rise
Your diamond mommy with slanted eyes
Holding this grip he cocked the green and shit

When a nigga plays sick, we can all get sick

But love, you know these are making me weak
Bank rolls and shit, massages in the French tubs
Mackin 'this bitch, nigga wife
So when you turn that coke around
Remember those days that you were dead broken
But now your style and I raised you
I basically made you a gift
You know my pussy is all of that
So they give me 5-carat bagets and all that.
From Dolce Gabana to H Vendell I'm ringing bells
So who the beach? I still keep you on the smallest crocodiles
Custom made so we can lie down in the shade remembering
On how I fuck shit
Especially when I'm flipping Baileys
You don't care how you move with them other moms
Fuck them, Reebok, you let them know who your wife was.
I have you in front with Armani sweaters

I swear to God I just landed
All around the world .. (same song)
A-T-L (same song)
Real-adelphia ... friend, it's all over the world
London, England, South of France
I am a Tokyo giant like Ichiro, I am
Piss poor black hood but I blew
Look at the hotel, the Cap 'or Capri
Bathrobe, slippers in the lobby like "Oui"
Your man will bear manta ray, handling a steak
Five and nine, good wine, good dinner, or so
Or am I mixing in Switzerland, trying to buy time
Dancing in Bali when it's beautiful in Cali
Brunchin 'on all 4 seasons, out of the ordinary
Nigga go back to the books to the rhymes that took me
All around the world .. (same song)
Brooklyn Bomber (same song)
Detroit Players (same song)
Chi-Town .. around the world
Said everything is love, Shore Club, M-I-A
Party in bungalow eight, when I stay
The pool looks like a hundred Beyonce
Come talk to me, mommy at the Yves Saint
Laurent, I hope, she's not too young
Only twenty-one and older let another black man shape her
I'm just trying to show you how a ballerina and a roller
Sleep somewhere, tell the pilot to keep the engine
Running, then I wake up at Martha's Vineyard
Saint Bart this year, I think I'm going to spend Christmas
Remembering the time my mother couldn't spend Christmas
Now I'm going to send it to your little wish list
Anywhere in the world, anywhere for my girl
Forever my lady, blind, crippled and crazy
Worldwide
Said it's not where you are from, it's where you are
Real niggas in Brooklyn, some niggas don't clap
They are real murderers in Cali, some blacks just act
Hollywood as if they were out of the neighborhood, everything is good
Real players in D-Twa, some of them thrown
Slackin 'on mackin', the resting paradise for hoes
Disciplined gangsters, come on Charlie, I know
Shit, it's not about your city or municipality
It's about whether you're really that thorough
And if so, holla your boy
I put my hand over my heart, that means I feel you
Real recognizes real and you look familiar
I'm a nigga from Bed-Stuy but I do it to death
I promise I'm at St. Thomas Homie eating at Chef's
One-twelve, A-T-L, is the sun up yet?
We'll take you all over the world ... it's the same song (same song)
Everywhere (same song)
It's the same song (same song)
We'll take you all over the world ... same song (same song)
Same song (same song)
Same song (same song)
Worldwide..
Nike Airs is right (consult)
My bucket is low (consult)
My Rocawear is incredible
Fuck it, I guess I got my arrogance back
Mom, they said I killed a man.
Well, I guess I got the dagger back.
It's the Roc, you bastards, we're BACK!
In the heezy
Jigga Man, B. Sige to M-Easy (what's up, fam?)
Oschino and Sparks and Freeweezy (holla!)
Mickey, Mallory, Chris and Neef, hello!
All I need is the love of my crew.
And all I need is a girl who has a jammy
Like Meth and Mary, like Marvin and Tammi, uhh
Now understand that we cannot be stopped
Like us underground kings, riding dirty
A nigga has been focused since I said hi at 30 (what's up?)
Young niggas, you can't hurt me
Better look at me and watch me
I set your empire on fire
Yes, ah, Jay, ah ...
Double G-A, livewire nigga, holla back!
All I need...
Rocawear ... (consult)
Nike Airs ... (consult)
Half spoon ... (uh huh)
Armadale in the club, a pair of duckets (yeah)
A couple of girls next to me, let's ride
All I need...
That new coupe (got it)
A rag and a pocket full of loot (I have them)
And I'm on my way
Everything I need in this world of sin.
It's me and my girlfriend! (haha)
When I'm at the club, she fits my shoe well (wow!)
I have to change it to my waist, just in case (uh huh)
A clown wants to turn, I have to catch my bitch
I wanna play a movie, I could give you a clip (buck!)
But don't ad-libbin ', nigga, stick with the script
Now all I need is an expensive lawyer
And they came to court too, I thought you knew
I can't even steal from a nigga, muh'fuckas will sue
When I'm surrounded by screaming muh'fuckas like you?
But the real niggas don't worry about the number one crew
All I need...
Rocawear ... (consult)
Nike Airs ... (consult)
Half spoon ... (uh huh)
All I need...
That new coupe (got it)
A rag and a pocket full of loot (I have them)
On a sunny day some girls want to play
And I'm on my way
Listen, the cream is too long, my team is too strong
Bleek is too hot, Beans is gone
You all niggas in sight, the beams are on (see everyone)
You all block desert, all your demons are gone (bye!)
Any Sunday gun game is optional
However, niggas want it like Soul II Soul (how do you want it?)
Whoever has the hops blocked, go to the hole
The left hand will support them like a little more than six
Now he runs with small ass blows
Read my background sheet, nigga: three classics!
Shut your mouth, I have A-Rod numbers
All of you muddaskunks are buried in the trunk
When the bomb exploded
I leave you relaxed in the hospital, looking at M * A * S * H for months
Then I dump the dough into the D.A. desk
And I run free of Scottish and piss on the steps
We have no respect, no law or government
Why are you fucking with him?
Made of matter, why are you fucking with them?
All you need is the R-O-C, baby
All I need...
Rocawear ... (consult)
Nike Airs ... (consult)
Armadale in the club, a pair of duckets (yeah)

Listens

Roc-A-Fella Records
Highway, Oschino and Sparks, Chris and Neef
(All I need)
Mickey and Mallory
M-Extra money, ha
Track! Rell
Oh yeah
You play with known assassins, known to explode Known for carrying plastic pistols, attached with chrome
And known for raising more
I'm depressed for whatever
Jigga man, you heard
Jay Z, you heard
Hova, you heard
Roc-A-Fella, you heard
Sigel-Sigel, you already heard
Now everyone wants to rhyme like Hov
Because I rhyme like I'm rhyming on the Rov
My mind likes diamonds, I'll blind you to the shows
No shine shine
I do not? Kill niggas, right?
My person, swindler turned rapper, smells a crack aroma
Send shots as you take! in any language
Leave the niggas in a coma when I'm hitting that Fifth
Light the chicks from Crowns and bamboos
And have the camcorder record your hand movements
And for what? You'll act like you're better than Hov
Cats Should Open On Letterman's Show Now
Cats is funny
All I do is get money and it will seem like funny shit to me
Everyone talks like they're better than Hov
But that shit is so funny to me
Jigga man, you heard
GIVES. act like I have a hunger for Jay
If they lock me up in a cage, you go partying
I still have millions buried in the sock drawer
Still holdin 'mine in the nigga corner
What can't kill me can only make me stronger, nigga
And when I come home
Get your butt off the throne
Everything went back to how shit was
I could drop a mess, I'm gonna stay awake
Niggas trying to break my will
You know that's not my steel
You are dealing with a higher power
Make them like Dwight Eisenhower
My life can move a thousand miles an hour
Ponder me friends
As my world spins like the wheels of a bicycle spoke
It is much deeper than soap, it is a constant dramatic series
All they see is money, they want me to blind the jury.
All this shit can make the mind get tired
The sun will shine clearly
Do you know what i do
Flow sicker on every record, watch it shine
Glock nine nigga, heavy necklace
Look at mine, I'm about to make niggas so jealous
Ice in every letter
With this CEO of Coca-Cola on Broadway
I never heard so many joints from one man
I bounce the chickens, make the gun jam
Of raw cocaine, rip out your whole brain
Make it really easy to lift your chain
BK style, do you see Jay? How?
We don't play fair, we play dirty
Go ahead stand there we spray crowds
Jigga, huh
Jigga, what
Jigga-Jigga, huh?
Jigga, what
Jigga-Jigga, huh?
Jigga, huh
Jigga, what
Jigga-Jigga, huh?
Jigga, what
I am a monster, I sleep whole winters; wake up and spit summers
Ghetto nigga, putting Will Smith numbers
I have money for 6's and Hummers, chickens between us
We just try not to let this shit become us
(Once again it's life, yeah)
I don't know why, I get so high, oh
(He is an intoxicating man, they don't know why they do what they do)
The allure of breaking the law
It was always too much for me to ignore
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man I'm out of life, fuck it, I'm lost
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet doll
My friends get tennis bracelets
Travel to Venice, replace your winters with
The sun ... is no longer fun, I'm tired
Man it's just a game, just game to play it
Without saying a word, the ghetto has a mental telepathy.
Man, my brother naturally rushed
The next one was me, but what puzzles me
Shit, I know how this movie ends, I still play
The starring role in "Hovito's Way"
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my focus, stop shaving
Because I'm doing more (OH NO!)
But every time I felt "That was it", he would call me back
Called me back
Man, he called me back (OH NO!)
I'm like a Russian gangster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top as a toupée, mix the water with the soda
You can all get it as a group page on your 2-way
I am living proof that crime pays
Putting cars in his name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their mornings on the train:
On the house to recover everything they claimed
Or even the worst pain is anguish
Learn that you are the lover only after that love is killed
And mixed anger and sadness lead to mistrust
Now it becomes hard to love again
But the charm of the game keeps calling your name
To all Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
All scammers in love with the same thing
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my focus, stop shaving
Stay away from hoes, lower the toast
Because I'm doing more (OH NO!)
But every time I felt "That was it", he would call me back
Man, he called me back (OH NO!)
I never felt more alive than riding a shotgun
In Klein Green 5, until the police pulled weapons
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the solution I need.
What the game did to my pulse, with no results
The game is a light bulb with eleven million volts.
And I'm just a floss addicted moth
By whatever means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if that means lost lives
And I can't explain why I love to get high
Baby, "life!" smoke blueberry heaven, blink twice
I'm on the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean, even James Dean couldn't escape the charm
Die young, leaving a good-looking corpse
Of course...
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my focus, stop shaving
Stay away from hoes, lower the toast
Because I'm doing more (OH NO!)
But every time I felt "That was it", he would call me back
Called me back
Man, he called me back (OH NO!)
Once again is life
Once again, it is life.
(OH NO! I don't know why, I ...
Get so high oh
Get so high oh
Get so high, high of life)
The allure of breaking the law
It was always too much for me to ignore
I have a thing for the great Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet doll
My friends get tennis bracelets
Travel to Venice, replace your winters with
The sun ... is no longer fun, I'm tired
I put my feet on the footprints they left me
Without saying a word, the ghetto has a mental telepathy.
My brother rushed naturally.
Then it was me ... but what puzzles me
Shit, I know how this movie ends! I'm still playing
The starring role in "Hovito's Way"
"In the valley of my world
You will be my only girl "
Once again it is life, oh no!
"In the valley of my world
You will be my only girl "
Once again it is life, oh no!
I'm like a Russian gangster, drinking distilled vodka
Peel off the top like a toupée
Light the pot, make a souffle
You can all get it as a group page on your 2-way
I am living proof that crime pays
Say "hurray" to the bad boy, and all the boys
Putting cars in his name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their mornings on the train:
Just to see that love locked up and the family came
On the house to recover everything they claimed
Or even the worst pain is anguish
And mixed anger and sadness lead to mistrust
But the charm of the game keeps calling your name
To all Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
All scammers in love with the same thing
I'm like Pookie in New Jack, cleaned with the roof back
Across the tracks I produce crack
I'm still a devil, no less, for green alone
Bring out my worst, just the gift and the curse
No one said it would be easy, nigga livin 'is work
It's hard not to comb your hair in the Arnage or fuck the Arnage
When the Benz doors are raised off the floor
And every night false hairs want to match your ball
That's life
Yeezy, Hova, Yeezy
Yeezy Yeezy, Hova, wait
Either you love me or you leave me alone
Oh they want me to fall (fall)
They want me to fall (fall)
They want me to stop (stop)
They want me to go
I'm gone (already)
I'm home
Hey i'm home
Hey i'm home
Oh (oh), they want me to fall (fall)
Fall from above (above)
They want me to fall (fall)
I already left (I left)
The shit I'm in (already)
I'm home
Hey i'm home
Hey i'm home
These niggas want me to go, don't they know I'm gone?
They know I'm a space shuttle level, they need oxyg-g-g-gen
Don't you know they are boring? Don't you know that I yawn?
The only exciting moment is when they mention Shawn
Have you seen a single white woman when she dyed her hair blonde?
Sometimes I look at these rappers, the movie reminds me of them
Somebody turn off these guys, don't they know I'm on
Can't you see how silly trying to kill me with songs?
What the hell are they, Lauryn, they are gently killing me
You speak to me to death, all you do is speak
I open the door for them, what else can I do?
These niggas want me to walk on them
Someone talk to them before I go
Oh they want me to fall (fall)
Fall from above (above)
They want me to fall (fall)
They want me to go
I'm gone (already)
The shit I'm in (hey)
I'm home
Hey i'm home
Hey i'm home
I taught them about fish scales, they want me to fish for them
They want me to stay clean and then I prepare a plate for them
All this just for them or they have a slight for him
They want it to disappear like it's a change for them
They say I'm on the road, they want me to feel for them
But what they admit is that they have nothing for him.
And really the fact is that we are not on the same support
Don't pay the same taxes, stick with the same bitches
So how am I on the road, what am I missing?
Nigga, I've been missing, nigga, I'm gone
The shit you just witnessed I've been
And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it
Everyone can tell you how to do it, they never did it
Now these niggas are crazy, oh they call me camel
But I mastered the drought, what the hell am I an animal
Fall from above (above)
They want me to fall (fall)
They want me to stop (stop)
They want me to go
I'm gone (already)
I'm home
Hey i'm home
Hey i'm home
I'm already in the hall, on the wall
On another level, on another plane already
Niggas compares me to Biggie and Pac ya (ya)
As if I'm already gone
If you can't see
I'm not worried about you because it's already me (already)
Yeah you know enough with the complaints
Boo-hoo now, eat food now
There is nothing given that you already have to claim your shoes
Yes, so in short, I don't know who you're running with
I'm already at the finish line with the flag waving
Come on
Oh they want me to fall (fall)
Fall from above (above)
They want me to fall (fall)
They want me to stop (stop)
They want me to go
I'm gone (already)
The shit I'm in (hey)
I'm home
Hey i'm home
Hey i'm home
Hey i'm home
Oh (oh), they want me to fall (fall)
Fall from above (above)
They want me to stop (no)
They want me to go (no)
The shit I'm in (already)
Hey i'm home
What, tssh, you, what
Whoever, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi
Cutie, who smells like Miyake, half Filipina
For now, let's call her Suki, she got me, this booty hitting
Firm tits like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ
Real reason to disturb the tool and keep tied with jewelry, look at me
Girlie tried to lure me in and lock me up, you gotta get up early
Because the one who is playing is not me
Out for the dollars you would have resisted stuck and dropped me "
I said with maturity: "You are right
But prevention is better than cure, before the lovebirds
I can move to the suburbs, I need to check your story
To make sure you're unique
And you deserve to be my sunshine "
I can't go a day without my sun (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? Uhh)
Touch me with a golden smile (yeah)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, my sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)
A year has passed, and she saw things only for most of the girls
Listen in songs (uh-huh), stay in the gear phenomenon
Lots of ice in the air, around the neck the charm (that's right)
I risked a four bet for life to keep that shit on his arm
Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to crawl (uh-huh)
Just to say they crawled with mine, they slept with mine, he said
I'm not deaf or blind, niggas stressful
Hating because they are less than mine, they want sex with me
We choose ourselves, you act like you have chosen me
They oppose you then, they oppose me
We could crawl at low speed, the gat in the hosiery
Double crossed they got to triple me
(I'm thinking this is how it's supposed to be) Uh-huh
(One more thing:
If I ever screw up, will you hit me on the block?) Fo 'sho'
(She replied with her eyes wide open) Uhhhh
(Put that on everything?) I put it in my life
(Right)
Touch me with a heart of gold (uh-huh)
I can't go a day without my sun (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? Uhh)
Touch me with a golden smile (uhh)
I can't go a day without my sunshine, my sunshine (uhh, uhh, uhh)
If I needed it, will you give me your kidneys? (Uhh, uhh, fo 'sho')
Catch a case, do you catch it with me? (Mmm, fo 'sho')
Pawn your jewelry to come find me? (You know better)
Catch me with a girl, forgive me? (Uhh, now that, I don't know)
They spread rumors, will you defend me tooth and nail? (Uh huh)
They try to frame me, will you be there until the truth prevails? (uhh)
(But would you be the same guy, when you blow up the sales ceiling?
That you were throwing rocks on the ceiling at 12, black?
This is the truth, until the loot becomes brittle
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
You and me dancing, from heaven or hell
I won't let you hit the ground if I'm falling
Now imagine that I leave you in this cold world, rolling for the dolphin
It's you and me in this old woman, we take the belt
It's just still my sun, uhh
I can't go a day without my sun (uh-huh) ahh-haaa (say what? Uhh)
Touch me with a golden smile (yeah)
I can't go a day without my sun, ahh-haaa
London bridges are falling
Not bridges but breeches when Jigga is in town
Lady show me your panties
Run away from the night or we end up in The Sun
I just pee, unless you do
Oh Nelly is gone, so Makaveli
Bring two packages of condoms when you come on TV
If diamonds are girls' best friends, my crew
We would like to invite you to
Our family -
Jewels, I mean, because my jewels are currently protected by the queen
Then came the dawn, and
I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much I love you
That's all that's all baby
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
I never felt that before
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
I never felt that before
But there always is; that's it, that's it baby
Uhh, uhh!
This is the shit you dream of with friends hanging out
Back to back, receding
It looks like our plans to get a grant
Then go to college, you didn't move or go out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to launch, we need a mound
Big dreams in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, I've been playing this Marvin
But that's too far, niggas starve
I have dreams of bagging snidd-ow, the size of pillows
I see cakes every time my eyes close
I see walks, sixes, I have to get those
I never felt that before
(American dream)
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
I never felt that before
I never felt that before
(American dream)
Uh, uhhhh!
Now see life right there, and it seems to be there
It's not quite close, and it's not like we're
Professionals moving decimals
Do you know where police? Nah! Do you have a connection? Not!
Who in F knows how to be successful?
I need a personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche mode
They say it's heavenly, it's all in the stars
Because you guys aren't fucking with me! The ironies are
At all costs better avoid these bars
Get ready, let's go, get out of the car
Going in circles is a vicious circle
Wake up Muttley, you're dreaming again
Your own reality show, the season begins
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
I never felt that before
(American dream)
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
(I'm just an American dream)
(American dream)
But there always is, that's it, that's it baby
Step one in this process: scramble your projects
And head to the heights where the great coca is processed
You have to convince them that you are not from the enclosure
Please speak slowly because you do not speak English
If you like it after a couple of trips
And your money is direct, he will send you
Now you're in a game where only time can tell
Survive droughts, I wish you well, wait
Survive droughts? I wish you the best
How sick am I wish you health
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth
I wish you an idea so you can see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackers are up
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time
I am an american dream
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
I never felt that before
(American dream)
Oh no, oh, I never gave up in any way
I never felt that before
(I'm just an American dream)
I never felt that before
(American dream)
But there always is, that's it, that's it baby
American dream
And you say New York
Uh huh
Put your hands together
Young!
Uh huh
Yeah uh-huh
Yes! (Yes!)
It was from scammers, huh
The world is my custies
New rich goalkeeper
The way I flip rooms
In front of all these other rap artists, but I
Mum wore mink, dad ran numbers
My way of shining is like a million dollar bill
I'm still grinding, military jacket lining
40 below Timbs, putting my M's on
My best friend is gone
I saw bad days, I still find songs where I listen to it
Get my Mary J. Blige Reminisce on
So I got on that shit shit I've been on
Spin corners in Enzo with wheels
But for information, puffing at Endo-Nesia
Give me amnesia
I relax, it's true, I'm a big nigga
I want heaven
The world when it ends
Let them live, divide it, change it, uh
Sixes equip it, man, I did it, ready
A hit list along with all my names.
I came
(Woo!) Uh-huh (geah)
I want heaven baby
I want heaven baby
And auction all my cars
Don't cry for my Argentina, the Beamer harassed me
He made trips abroad, they attended me in Sardinia
Billie Jean, the damn boy is not mine
And the Roc broke, it made people lose hope
Now I'm back in go mode, back in go-go's
Rose gold, flow Rosé, although I'm fine
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger than before
Here we go and I'm not Domino
When everything falls, I'm like Kanye's jaw
I could break but not bend, until I hold the sky in my hand
Yes that's my goal
And then I tell you Freddy Adu
Prodigal child, you are not ready for the future, ture
Then I disappear into the Bermuda Triangle
My name will be seen such
I want heaven baby
Fucking, right? Ha, I know
I know what you niggas wonder
Are you ever going to fall?
No...
Much speculation
About the money I've made, the honors I've killed
What is he really like? Is that black really paid?
Hustlers that I have met or dealt with directly
Is it true that you stayed in the meat and slept with a TEC?
What is the position you have?
Can you really match a platinum artist triple dollar for dollar?
But only your gold goes alone?
If Roc-A-Fella bends, and you stay out in the cold
Is it going to charge motherfuckers 11 for an O?
For the umpteenth time asking me questions like Wendy Williams
Harassing me, then I get angry when I feel feelings
Can I have a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
As I watch my role, the ice spins on my sleeve
Latinos at Chevys, down by Pico con Frederico
I answer all your questions but then you have to go
Now the question I ask you is: "How much do you want to know?"
(One million) Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh
(One million) How do we do it, what?
(One million) Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh
(One million) How do we do it? Ugh!
'98, remix of Preemo, and there is nothing different
I don't know what the hell, niggas have been smelling
Jigga is still dipping, chrome in the whips and
Still in the game, nigga, hooked like glue
I'm a scammer like you
What I can do? Knowing that I'm supposed to comb
I'm the poster boy for the swindler, the rock lizards and the crocodile
Live ironic and what not
Put all that ice on a watch face just to heat it up
Now you see me on your stages, rocks in the air.
MAC double one, black, I'm troublesome
Everything I have for girls, hard cock and gum
Flip bricks like Fred, Barney Rubble and them
It's the Roc-A-Fella clique, what's wrong with them?
He's not a damn nigga, we're doing our thing
BLAOW !!!
(One million) Uh-huh uh uh uh uh-huh uh-huh
(One million) How we do it, come on
(One million)
It sounds so beautiful, don't you agree, ladies and gentlemen?
Say ah! Well they call me Jay-Hova because the flow is religious
And since I was 16, I had digits
I'm seeing this industry clearer
Like I have cocaine in the trunk and cops in the rearview mirror
I flow slowly until I die
The flow be Ay, blessed
For the moms I speak Spanish, little
Oh this one, I have time like a segue
Now holla back, baby!
Uh-huh-huh, Jay-Z, you're fucking okay
On the darkest nights, drop my gun by the light
To guide you, show you how it's done
I am the question and the answer as Iverson
Jets be private, there's no door to lift
Hit with this, wake up with one in your brain
And the flow of cocaine numbs your pain
This is not your speed, young Mayne, run in your lane
So I can go through a hundred and change
I put one on your frame, imagine that
Who is running the game? Let's do that
I guess we are one and the same
One million and one ... one more time
Novacane flow, ho, you don't know
Like a ballet player in an Impala, Jigga remains low
Until next time, nigga
What the hell ... what the hell ...
Verify verify verify
What the hell ... what the hell ...
People know me on these streets player, I'm not new
Surprise, what I do is already legalized
Analyze what I throw, there is no love lost
Flow, you have to pay a little more now
It is platinum, now a few days we put the gold
We step it up, they'll never want a showdown
These days I calmed down, I see that success makes a boy happy
Uh-huh, you know, this rap star, Papi Chulo
Jay-Z, Hugo, of course player you lost player
I know you rappers want to see me fail
But quick to see a 600SEL V-12
Live with it, you have dough to get it
I got mine, your little bit of money couldn't stop mine
Your blocking time, too hot, too many hands on your cake
Seventy-thirty, the nigga you work with works for me
Bottom line
People know me on these streets and in the towns I've been through
Looking at me, stay focused, I'm giving you a poker surprise
Analyze how I floss, of course there is no lost love
We'll be the Bronx for BK'lyn, together, about a ton or better
Along the way we entered into rhyme, very underrated
This is why I am winning in this world of sins
Steady grinnin, money boss spending
Distant from dirty women, sir, I'm quite influential
Preach my words and I don't know what you should
Show you want to be me, but won't show it
I had a ten year career, hey, I can't complain
He took the next step, see, from Coca-Cola to Pepsi
From the grass bx, riding the south beach on a jet ski
Play to survive, you're not living just living
You breathe well, but where I'm from, it's forbidden
Come, bad decision, you prefer to be in prison
There is no duck, what I am delivering will not be forgiven
You have to walk towards the light, everything is fine
I make sure that everything you bear is kept tight
Big (* boom *) Lord Tariq, Jay-Z, out of sight
I spend nights in the corners, I see the crack, I copy my first Mac
I am no longer afraid to pump what you pump, now I explode again
That hurts, it doesn't seem like C.R.E.A.M can fatten my bag
Without the benefits of a doubt, I hit the nigga more
But damn it, trying to see Nas was your worst game
Am I greedy? Like Amin Idi, look at me
In a Salinii fly give me pictures and the hat
I flip my loot twice a week on the trifest streets
You have no right to eat according to the laws of life that you maintain
There is no love lost, none taken, none giving
Highlighting how I'm living it, thinking when my loot arrived
Look what I did with it, I bought my click glaciers
I copied a live crocodile, cut it, hit my block
I still get the taste of the street
But look at that boy right there, a lump in his sleepwear
Woke me up like it used to be in my heist years
Bubble eye small fry loaded four five
Just thirst for a person with glitter to just walk around
Now that I can see 360, now that it's me, that's jiggy
Those cold heads want to hit me, whoa
Uh huh yeah yeah
Lasted!
Uh, uh, uh like dat yeah
Come on, bring the choir
I'd risk everything
For a kiss, everything
Yes, I would do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
Make an offer, lose a rib, break a cap, trust that
Run to the gates of heaven, trade my life for yours
Leave a steak by the door, my house, your house
Just remember to turn off the lights in the hallway
My brother from another pop, less a shot
We are Nino and Gee Money, man, we all have
From the porch to the big guys, stopping us from playing hoops
And we getting mad, throwing stones from the ceiling
Straight man, I thought we would never progress
But look at us now man, we are young executives
My nigga Give me, my nigga Biggs, my nigga Ty
My nigga High, my nigga Gotti
We embody all that is right with the world
No matter how pretty she is, you'll never like my girl
This is how we run, when you're not around
I'll spank you son, keep it in line
God forbid, keep this in mind, my nigga
I'd risk everything
For a kiss, everything
Yes, I would do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
For a kiss, everything
Yes, I would do anything (Anything?)
But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thank you for letting me flourish, for your wisdom, for your womb
Through the ceiling over my head, through my shoes, through my bed
Because the most important lesson in life was when you said
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was panting
Thanks for the look of love just when I was leaving
At night you thought I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
As a man I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, he would rush like a pimp would
You're a queen, you deserve the cream, all that glittered
Everything that shines, everything that is mine.
I'd risk everything
For a kiss, everything
Yes, I would do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For a kiss, everything
Check it out, uh, uh
Dear nephews, I am writing 'this without a pen or notebook
And I'm signing it, uncle, best friend and dad
Don't look back if you fall and you feel bad
I'm there from your cut to when you peel the scab
If there comes a time when you don't feel your real father
Don't follow no nigga, that's shit
The world is yours, some girls are good, some girls are prostitutes
Walking away from situations gives you the perfect view
Bite your tongue for nobody and whatever is said
Take it however you like, a closed mouth won't feed
You know my number when it's red code
You're my nephew, fuck it, we got it on my little nigga
I'd risk everything
For a kiss, everything
Yes, I would do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For a kiss, everything
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For a kiss, everything
Yes, I would do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
I'd risk everything
For a kiss, everything
Yes, I would do anything (Anything?)
Anything for you
Uh huh, uh huh
Turn on my headphones
Hip-hop you
Turn on my headphones
Be high all of you
Turn up the headphones
Jigga man huh
Jigga man huh
You know what i do
I remove your roof, friend, let the sun shine
Really thirty-six without the gun I'm skinny
Ignorant bats, I will take you from day one
Well here is the surprise of your life, the Glock, not the microphone
How are you going to talk about MCs on my heel?
I just got that thing, dude, the chrome wheels
Both arms are thick, sleeves cold
Any time is a hundred g on your grill
Okay, but it's not real.
Love for war, hug, squeeze that steel
You have to flow, that's great with me
You have a little dough that is great with me
You have a little car, little jewels
You know the wrist frostbit minus two degrees
Almost as blue as the sea the way I maneuver the beat
I can't see his eyes, who could it be?
Then I skated to four, before I went on tour
He came back and it's clear
Rappers don't rap the same
Their flow they are lifting my slang
I saw the same shit happen to Kane
Three cuts on your eyebrows trying to freak out
The game is mine, I'll never kick it out
I better hope I retire gracefully
You know I'm heavy on your mind
You know the fact is annoying
This bracelet on my forearm, the Jordan of rap
Twenty-three MCs, what he's recording is shit
Yeah yeah man jigga huh
Yes, yes, I've been getting money, sitting in the twenties
Hot shell all those niggas can get from me
Cocktails thrown into your living room, boom
I'm so confrontational
I should never have been paroled
I took a step back I saw myself
Look where my head was
Is where that mass is, I have to get that
Some died but left batteries
I did well, and on top of that I am a nice dog
Jigga has been cold as shit before the ice
You know me you know me
Yes, exploding Chrissy
Buck sixty through the gothic city
Who do you trust (mermaids) to get it?
From my CDs, 'Pac and Biggie
'Cara and Juvie, looking at her face, she is cute
Perfectly, this perfect booty
She wants to listen to Ma $ e
I stop at the store in front of Sam Goody
I jump, I put on my sweatshirt
I don't hate, girl took me job from state to state
It is the least I can do
Order LL too
I started the car, baby, let's go
Is a little party cheating on me off guard? not just full clip
This makes the black barbie, my car is
In the robbery, p-o-r-t
I'm a heartbeat away from deep thinking
Close your eyes, can you see me think?
Can you see the girl panic when she sees how we drink?
Mind intoxicating my shadow boxing thoughts
Demons fighting, trying to understand the meaning of life
Am I really here or am I somewhere in between?
I mean I have my niggas, I have my girl who shoots shoots with me
I'm coming to terms with the night Biggie was killed
And I sold 5 million records, damn it, I'm pretty
Now one has to wonder if he has lost his hunger
But niggas can be sure that I'm even more rude than before
I bet you've never seen him like this
Just stay on that floor girl
And I will grant you all your wishes
You know, you know, you know (you're hot)

They had to retire about 50 thousand before they found you, girl
I brought backpacks from that bankroll, I'm a D boy, baby, you know
I'm an original D-boy, they go bankrupt if they try to keep up
There is no roof in my car but I have mirrors on the roof
I'll spread bread in bed, have you ever had sex in a million?

How's that for love of the computer? She rolled her eyes.
I'm like, "Ooh, you're so nasty"
I don't have to go go-go
You have a private show that is like Magic City
I have lots of fifty, I have lots of hundreds
Let's make a role play, let's act as you like
You throw that body, I will throw dollars
But not 1 and not 5
Have you ever seen a Grover Cleveland?
That's a thousand dollar bill, baby
Whatever you want girl

Nicole Richie, roll with me, they're on a baby diet

Very often I think of you and the Beatles, not because the music sounds the same, but because they were true envelope throwers, you know, they were always about what follows, telling the audience. They weren't afraid to get ahead of their audience, and I feel like that's what you're trying to do. I mean, this album is a lot about arts and things that kids wouldn't necessarily be interested in.
The truth is, as for hip-hop and the arts, we were like cousins, you know. If you think about those days with Fab Five, Freddy was with Madonna and Basquiat and everything. You know, we all went to those clubs, that was when hip hop was more underground. The arts and hip-hop really celebrated together, but when the arts became part of the gallery, it was this separation. But we almost got together.
You have a song on your album called "Tom Ford". I'm sure some people think, why is he on a gay designer white cock? What is happening there?
Pause.
Let me clarify that: I am not ... [Laughter]
I said it metaphorically. But the line that I think says a lot, you say, "I don't pop molly, I'm moving Tom Ford." You know, everyone else is talking about ecstasy and you say, "I don't do that; I do shit. I'm in business."
Man I'll just take you with me
To explain your shit?
I could help you with Harry Belafonte. You had a fight. Show the photo. I mean, this is very bad what happened to you and Harry because, I mean, look look at this. Is he 86 years old and you 43? So he's literally twice your age and it's a tie.
He got into his case because he, I remember when they did this to Michael Jordan, remember that, when they said to Michael Jordan, “You are the king of blacks; get more involved, do more. "And, you know, that bothered you, and I don't blame you for being upset.
Yes, I just didn't think it was the right place. If it was something, really as a real problem, you know, I'm not too hard to find, especially for someone of that stature. He can communicate with me and we can have a conversation, we will do something good together. But, you know, I just thought it was kind of great for me, and I didn't particularly appreciate that dragging my wife was a little hard ...
I really like Bruce Springsteen.
Harry was on our show once. It was iconic, as it is, and I don't know if you ever saw this clip, but I wanted to get it for you. This is from a 1968 television special that she did with Petula Clark, and this was a giant controversy in 1968 because she touched it. Show the clip to show you what I'm talking about. This is what bothers people.
It's kind of weird having a conversation with three people, like you're ignoring them. I have to make eye contact.
And they are all gay, by the way.
Think of us as your waiting support group.
We will bring them in a few minutes. You're the first guest we've ever had who said that. Everyone else says, "Fuck it." They don't even think about it.
Well, I was doing a little math and depending on when your first album came out, you will be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in seven years.
Is it based on your first album?
Twenty-five years since your first album. So in seven years, you will be eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I am sure you will get the first vote unless there are some steroids.
I'm not going!
You do not go?
Nah, I'm just ...
You're going to go. Who would you like to induce?
I cheated.
Let's say you're busy ...
Everything will be OK. You owe me, you owe me a partner.
You owe me a partner.
I realized that one of the Conservatives' talking points after the Trayvon Martin trial was: Why are we talking about this tragedy when hundreds of black children are being shot in Chicago? But over the weekend, the Congressional Black Caucus held a two-day summit there, and they spoke on this same issue that conservatives say they are never talking about. It was covered by NPR, MSNBC, Chicago media, C-SPAN, not Fox News. It seems that Fox News does not want to allow this fact in the sense that they are actually talking ...
Than?
Trolling concern. It's, you know, saying, well, you know I shouldn't, don't worry about this, worry about the other, but you really don't care about the other, you just want to change the subject.
But I think that excessive vigilance is part of the problem. I mean, look at New York City and see stop and search. I mean, watch over communities of color ... I mean, I don't know, I can't talk about this better than you, but I'm curious or your opinion, Jay Z--
I really don't want to scare the United States, but the real problem is that there is no middle class, right? So the gap between having and not having becomes ever wider.
Well, more jobs would be better than the police. We won't need police ...
You need them both. I think, again, that it is a mistake. More jobs will help, but in the short term people want police stations. We are very unfair to people who live in public housing. It was poorly built, and they were placed there, but they deserve much more protection. The overwhelming majority of perfectly innocent and honest people ...
I grew up in Marcy Projects; public housing was a temporary stop until they got together and moved on.
But even if you're there for a couple of years, you don't want to be a non-cop. I'm in favor of that, affordable low-income rental housing was my number one goal; It is something else that Republicans, through the Tea Party, have cut entirely, unfortunately.
But I don't think Stop-and-Frisk are some bad apples. That is an institutionalized racism that the NYPD has been carrying out for years. They detained more black youths than there are black youths in New York last year. They don't seem to stop and search the Wall Street bankers - they have tons of cocaine.
You are fighting a straw man. Of course, Stop-and-Frisk, the way they do it, is wrong, but the answer is no less police. You hear people in the African American community in New York complain about Stop-and-Frisk, not getting the police out of here. They want the police to be there and to behave better.
The murder rate is at a minimum of one hundred years.
Yes, so I think you know that inequality is a big problem in several ways, but a lot of people were afraid when we went into the recession in 2008 that the progress we had made in crime is reversing, and this is actually a question Social. indicator that continues to improve.
And black people are also the main victims of crime disproportionately, and that's why they don't want to see how the police are taken. They want them to improve, but the answer is not to eliminate them.
If the murder rate is at least a hundred years old, why do we need to stop and search so much? Why do we need drones with the police department? Why we are building a wall in Mexico. Makes too many questions. Why are we such a police state now?
Don't punish all New York cities for Mike Bloomberg's tics. The fact is--
And Ray Kelly, let's not forget Ray Kelly.
Obama wants him as the national security tsar.
It is not true across the country that police departments are doing that. The Los Angeles police have greatly improved since the days of ...
But you are from Massachusetts. We saw, when the Douchebag brothers blew up the parade, Boston somehow had an army.
It was really weird: They closed the entire city for one day.
And they had half tracks and what looked like tanks. It didn't look like a police department that I ever saw.
We are an increasingly militarized society, and because these budgets are getting bigger, they need to justify those budgets. So sometimes you need to find the crime ...
But we didn't want the police on Occupy Wall Street, I'll tell you.
But you were not a victim of the crime.
We were victims of brutality. There is a 125-page report by NYU law professors, documenting all First Amendment violations by the New York Police.
(We are the ones with the flame) Yes
(We are controlling the game from now on) Huh
Yes! It is the world recognized, internationally connected
Roc-A-Fella Records, locally accepted

B. Sig., Rell, Peedi Crakk
Free, Young H-O, Bleek (You understand)
And presenting
It's Young C (Young C!), Philly's Home, young and hungry.
All the girls want to lust with me
I hit it once, then I give it to Neef
All those who hate mean they fuck with us
It's not a game, black people know that they are Toys R Us
They can't fuck with us (AAAWWWWWW)
I'm the only one, man, I'm money, hoes, clothes and shows
To do with your ho all wrapped in one, I'm not done!
Man I'm the shit after all is said and done
Whoever copies one returns for another
Fast fast, like fast refund
I'm the grrrrrrr, I mean money machine green
I have not finished! I am Omillio
And you like it
All those shit-talking enemies we don't like
We love that black mask, that black glove shit
Roll up on him don't give in, bitch
With my MAC, my TEC and my vest, just like that
For them, blacks who think that Mack Milli is not really from the streets
Those who are here will take you forever
And we won't leave you, never
And our voices will ring (rrrring!) Together
As one (AAAWWWWW)
It's free young! Move, work the wheel, move your hand with the V
But I'm like Chris when the cousin opened
Call me P.C.! The spirits spill, I take off, look how I'm killing the wheel
Tilt adjusted to the left, the shirt mixes with sweats
Take a picture, nigga, packing up the bills
I'm the one! Young H-O, a game of nothing
What do you think it would do to the brain of that lady you brought?
Listen darling! Turn one, this is Armi, drink a little
It's only 40 tests, it feels like 151
Rock Air Force 1's, swing a bun, hide shit in your hair
It's Hov 'the Hustler, I'm having an amazing career!
And you like it
All those shit-talking enemies we don't like
No, we love it, I have a full-bodied mommy

And we won't leave you, never
And our voices will ring (rrrring!) Together

Every day a star is born (and you say New York!)
Clap for them! Clap for them! Clap for them! Hears
Every day a star is born (and you say New York!)
Clap for them! Clap for them! Clap for them! Hears
I saw Mase do it, I saw you do it
X came in, caught lighter fluid
Still I got over it; clap for him!
But I am the plane, I am like the map for them
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it
No one could touch Puff when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin ', I'll applaud him
If he keeps going, pass him the torch
50 came like hurricanes
The shit was so advanced, I thought we were all dead
Wayne made "A Milli", 50 made a milli
You too, but what Em did was nonsense
His flow in "Renegade", fucking incredible
Applaud it!
Snoop chased him, Nelly got off
The Face Mob kept it as a ghetto for city H
Luda moved digits after she moved bitches
Drake is next, see what he does with him
Rule had a career, a couple of parts from movies
YOU. I literally wanted to go up the charts
How are you, Jeezy? What does
You all remind me of the early '92
Outkast landed, 3-you were sick
As a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A little too far, I can't fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang attacked him, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the purple ribbon
He switched to Ason and then to Ghostface
They had a hellish run, standing ovay, ayyy
Every day a star is born
Clap for them! Clap for them! Clap for them! Hears
Clap for them! Clap for them! Clap for them! Hears
And I'm one of one
Can't you see how long my career lasts?
My reign, the shine of Lulu's son
I've been a star ever since I ducked once
Once give up on him
For this corner office, it's so huge
Hello, Prez Carter.
Watch them play Monica all day
Hey i have so many different nicknames but only one Jay
Some friends, some hoes
But no, I'm not going anywhere, this Hov '
Every day a star is born (and you say New York!)
Clap for them! Clap for them! Clap for them! Hears
Every day a star is born
(And you say New York!)
Clap for them! Clap for them! Clap for them! Hears
And could it be a star?
Just to do it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the daylight, imagine
A slow transition from a little broken black de la Ville
I have a deal, a real life preserver
Dream about being behind the wheel like Jada
I relax now, I copy some ice later
It flows so sick, I thought he wrote the rap for him, no sir!
Cold flow like shoulders.
Of gold digging hoes when a bankrupt nigga approaches
I told you I'm focused, man
I'll let the bastards wet it and clap their hands for them!
Every day a star is born (and you say New York!)
Yes, hey, and clap your hands!
Hey, and clap your hands!
Clap for them! Clap for them!
Uh huh
Everything was fine just a week ago
Uh-huh-uh, everything was fine just a week ago
Last week i had everything
Uh, uh-huh-uh, I had all this good just a week ago.
I had the money ... I had the cars, the bitches
Uh-huh, yeah, everything was fine just a week ago
And the jewels ...
And then my damn niggas started snitching
Uh-huh, uh uh, me, me
Beatch!
Problems; I called him, he called me
We weren't partners, I hit him with my P
Let him open the doors of my keys
Yes, we talk, much more than cordially
Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread quickly
It wasn't fast enough to jump over the hedges with me
We got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
He used to call me from the place until he ran out of change
And when he called to collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I got on the phone
He's talking recklessly, I can feel the deception in his tone
I said, "Damn it, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?"
He said, "Main man, you think shit is sweet because you're home."
I just sat down, didn't spit any more speeches on the phone
I said to him: "The world does not stop, I have to continue ... continue".
From there I felt that the meat was on fire
I ran to the spy shop to add some more features on my phone
It can't be too safe, because niggas have two faces
And they show the other side, when they catch a new case
And you bought a new house where you could keep people
I don't see how this side of you could be triggered
Uh-huh, uh-huh, everything was fine just a week ago
A nigga standing up, now you sit down to aim
I used to have a firm grip, now you drop names
Everything was fine just a week ago
As if I put the toast on your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, I had more customers
Seventeen and I'm holding on around a mill
You could rescue me, make a judgment and file an appeal
I had niggas thinking I was uptown for real
He was very busy, he was also sick
Like a nigga from Brooklyn, straight from Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight until round 30
Freezing in the corners, still holding my crack
Looking up and down the block, what the fuck is the dough?
It came from the flat break to let the dough stack up
You tell the feds that I said, "I will never come back."
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy doesn't breed rats
You know the consequences of your actions, you cannot be serious
It was great when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new house where you could keep people
I don't see how this side of you could be triggered
It's funny how seven days can change
Everything was fine just a week ago
The lawyer I held you said you were leaking some things
All this after a week in the bing
I'm mad at myself because I didn't see the weakling
Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or it broke
We even pricked our finger, everything that came between us
Instead, you faced a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same makes you laugh, makes you cry (it's true)
And your son has to grow up, like, "Is this my dad?"
It was great when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new house where you could keep people
I don't see how this side of you could be triggered
It's funny how seven days can change
A nigga standing up, now you sit down to aim
Everything was fine just a week ago
Shit is a crazy man
All these niggas out here snorting
We were one step away from taking this crack money
And recycle it through the ghettos
And building our own hoods again
Now all of you niggas start laughing at each other
I have partners doing 15-20
I wouldn't have been FUCKING
If it didn't blow, beatch!
Just watch the game
And don't snitch
Sure we would go much further
Think you drink
Jay-Z, Short Dawg's in the mane of the house
You know i got it
I have it running
We have the money
I have nothing to do with crime baby
But I am recognizing
Rat bastard!
A word from hov
Last night I performed at the University of Arizona, I had a great time! Despite all the excitement and jokes (as well as technical difficulties) I missed an opportunity to say something important.
I think concerts like this should happen more often. (Outside the one or 2 festivals a year or "Zootopia") I'm going to put that in the universe ... next, Taylor Swift and Uncle Murda!
Sorry, not "Tweet" (do I?) So this will have to do ...
Love
When you think of Jay-Z, what comes to mind?
(Laughing)
It's Baby Thug!
Make my money, nigga!
Fuck what everyone says
Niggas can't stop me with rumors, I'm too strong
All day long, socks that explode in sweatpants pockets are bulky
My place is rolling, lower the price of coca and
He drove out the competition and let the doe flow
The police are approaching, I can make the time
But what I really have in mind is that there is nobody in the corral
I play low and try to make it hard to find myself
The feds are still trying to build a case since '93
Hey, you make moves, you pay niggas, that's how it is
When my time is up I'll be away but I'll try to live
I'm eating day by day, there's nothing sweet about it
Act like you don't know what I'm saying and they'll read it
Built for war as an armadillo
Chokes your butt with 2 through the pillow
And here take these four hot things, I have things
That make niggas spin, put niggas in the wind
Where you never see niggas again
I bless a dotted nigga, the skinny guy
My day begins and I'm running and I miss my gun
I am often blessed, but not these days because it is no longer fun
I am much worse than a puncher with 8 bullets in the chamber
I can't imagine the danger, when you finished these angry bow ties
When strangers pissed me off I took drugs to control it
Outside of opposition, I have stress on my mind
But I got into opposition, coming from my own kind and they are blind
We walk in peace but don't provoke us, we won't run
Because if it wasn't for that man, there would be no control of us
Her body put on red rum, twisted in broken poses
Pool of blood soaked in his clothes and looks like roses
Smelling Folgers and Moses couldn't save him
We go the way we came, As-salamu alaykum
Now greetings to the world
Gangsta nuh lives in a residential courtyard
Rude nuh boy lives in a neighborhood backyard
Too watchful, watchful, watchful
Too much his, his, his, his, his
They talkative, talkative, talkative
They their, their, their, their, their
Fuck all this cute black shit from Shawn Carter, HOV
Shawn was in that gospel shit
I was in the total fucking opposite
Shit, put a million dollars in the sock drawer
That's a war chest in case you need your chest removed.
You are all talking crazy under the IG photos
I can't accept threats, I have a pair of cufflinks (ah!)
Those were just a few words you'll never hear again (uh huh!)
For the last time don't believe these fools
I have never seen a worker have so many jewels (never!)
I have never seen the racer with so many cars (never!)
You all couldn't stop me, they're not as tough as they say they are
My advice is don't be too nice to black people
Just set the price for the niggas to live your life, my nigga
Once upon a time in the projects
Shawn was in flight mode, I bought a Pyrex
I was in fight mode and now it's "fuck me, millet"
I was moving those kilos, I help you move your villages
Sometimes you need your ego, you have to remind these fools
Who they are falling in love with, and we also have FN's
Before we had A&R, we also had AR
We still move like you niggas say they did
Ty Ty jumped on niggas and he's like 5'6 "
I have the heart of a giant, never forget it
Don't you ever forget, Jigga has this shit exploding
I pulled out the pot when we had no options
Gangsta nuh lives in a residential courtyard
Rude nuh boy lives in a neighborhood backyard
Too watchful, watchful, watchful
Too chatty, chatty, chatty
And they their, their, their, their, their
Fuck all this cute black shit from Shawn Carter, HOV
Put that drum in your ear, don't Srem'd
I'll Bobby Shmurda anyone who's heard of
Uh, you guys make me upload all this talking
Uh, niggas skip leg day just to run their mouth
I'm going to skip leg day, I still run the world
I went ahead with your team with a curved finger
Make niggas knit, niggas is out here fake
Tied front to back, not front
They'll make me a wig, I'll give them what they want, huh
Dreadlocks nuh lives in a backyard
Too watchful, watchful, watchful
Too chatty, chatty, chatty
Fuck all this cute black shit from Shawn Carter, HOV
Can't you see what my ambition is?
What a bam bam yes, Lord
And my seh, what a bam bam (Do it, Jay!)
What bam bam, what bam bam
I don't give a damn, I don't give a damn
When my dance comes and my joint and Guinness
Yow, crowd of people, go and think about your affairs
This is a hunting season, mek I tell you hunting season
Well I tell you something season, this is a hunting season
Voice of the bank pon gully
Look behind you; I'm about to pass you twice
Niggas can't pass my past
How do you propose a deal with the perfect gift?
There is no living person who can prove it
Only two who rest in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him
7 consecutive summers; critics might not admit it
But nobody in rap did it like me;
If you did it, I did it before
You get it, I had it;
I got mad at that, I don't want it no more
And that comes from everything, from turning that crude
Flippin 'whores, flippin' vocal chords
Young!
Young H.O., newly arrived from Italy
Trip financed by my best ability
He himself helped me in extra goods
For my mother, for my nephews, a lot of little ones
Versace flip flops, hip-hop brought me here
Music made me a millionaire, yeah
Multi for what's inside here
Inside my heart, besides that, I'm smart
He took the best of both worlds minus the madness
Although controversy follows me everywhere I dock
I block everything I hear
Outside like jealous clouds make the sun
Then I sit and lie down because my shine has shone
And then, sure, discover something strange with the doors open
Maybe the purple Porsche
Lavender Retriever
In Capri, a foreign place that needs your visa
Yes, Hovi's house; but it's like I never left, I had the global phone
Yeah yeah i kept in touch
I heard them complain at home, they complain too much
So hateful, bunch of guys I put out there acting so ungrateful
But dad is home, and he brought the forty auto chrome
For all the talkative talkative they've been doing
While they were running their mouths complaining about Summer Jam
I was in flip flops in the south of France
See how flip-flops with station number one for hip-hop and r & b?
Even in my absence, my presence is felt
That has to tell you that I'm the king, dog, if nothing else
I'm in another continent, you're still not happy
I am in the Mediterranean, you are still not relieved
Explain to me why I want to be you again
However, you can do a trick like that when you own the whole place
This is Rich Porter, part two
You can do a trick like that when you're rich before your debut
Money and murder, rapper or trapper
Either way I will serve you
Shooters on my team ... No, really, I have shooters on my team
Juan or Deron
As niggas want it, take an arm
They call me Lucky Lefty ...

자기 돈 좀 많나 봐
자기 스타일 진짜 멋있다
Geah yeah
Life is just a dream for me, I don't want to wake up
Thirty odd years without having my cake up
So I'm on the verge of my job 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we are here
Since we have to be here, life is nothing more than a beach chair
He went from having threadbare clothes, crossing over Abbey Road
I just hope to hear well; karma makes me fear life
Look, I have demons in my past, so I have daughters on the way
If the prophecy is correct, then the child should pay
For the sins of a father
And when you're no longer here to protect your face from the glare
I'll give you my share of Carol's daughter and a new beach chair.
I hear my angels sing ...
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to go
The shots sing to these other guys
But lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying
Every day hits every wave like it's Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no, I've never been on MySpace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving my space in this world of flies
Twists and ropes cut with diamonds I twists
Benzes around corners where the sun doesn't shine
I let the wheels take a look at the hope of the routine
Some said, "Hov ', how do you get to fly?"
I said, "For not being afraid of falling from the sky"
My physical exam is a shell, so when I say goodbye
My soul will find an even higher plane to inhabit
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to go
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to go
Life is nothing but a dream
Life is nothing but a dream
Intercut, the winner's cup
With winters hard enough to interrupt life
So I am holy and sinful, pleasant.
So to map it you have to look inside
Sure books can guide you but your heart defines you girl
In great shape as Heidi Klum, Maricón, I'm in
Permanent vacation, life is nothing more than a beach chair
This song is like a stamp card until you get here
So until she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A plan to print
A map for you to return
I'll make a bad smell for you to think
I ink these prose-filled verses
So they don't fool you with two cents
My last will and testament I leave to my heir
I hear my angels sing ...
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to go
Life is nothing but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to go
Life is nothing but a dream
I hear my angels sing ...
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to wake up, wake up
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to go
Life is nothing but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't want to go
I hear my angels sing
I hear my angels sing
I hit you in the celly, because I don't have time
Argue with your butt, if you're not really ready
You better look like Halle Berry ... or Beyoncé
Shit, so we're getting married
I brought sand to the beach because my beach is better
He left the house with 100,000, he ended up almost bankrupt
Don't be mad at me, I'm buying cube after cube
When he leaves, I say "Fuck it"
I can't carry this money with you
Burn this shit like it's Richard
Niggas asking "Is the oven on?"
It is the Roc in the building.
Neeveen akh kuch chir paake rakh le

Make me want to put the snake on you
I'm in my eighth summer, it's still hot - Young is the eighth wonder
All I do is get bread, yeah, I take Wonder

Ma, I don't have to tell you, but it's your boy Hov
From the USA USA, you just lie down slowly
Catch ya boy mingle in England, meddling in the Netherlands
We are rebels, we return home
Screaming: "Leave Iraq alone!"
But all my soldiers in the field, I wish you a safe return
But only love kills war, when will they learn?
It's International Hov, been having a flow
Before Bin Laden blew up Manhattan
We had it raw all day, Daddy in the hall
Cop one in shipping to give you more yay
Yeah but that's another story
But for now, mommy, turn it around and let the boy play (Jay)
Nahi teri jehi Sohni koi naar

Mundeya de bula ute teriya kahaniya
Channi ne ta khanne diyan galiyan vi shaaniya
Janjua ta hoya tera roop da diwana
Janjua ta hoya tera roop da diwana
Shawl sakiya na husan da vaar
Mundeya a bach ke rahi
Neither you hune hune today muteyaar
Mundeya a bach ke rahi
Neither you hune hune today muteyaar
Uh uh uh uh
It's big, pimpin 'baby (That's right)
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah
‘Because I don't need them fucking
Get them off the hood, keep 'em good
But I didn't screw them up
The first time you care, I'm kidding
Speaking of "What are the reasons?"
I'm a pimp in every way
Bitch, better trust and believe them
In the court where I keep them
Until I need a nut, until I need to beat the guts
So it's "beep beep" and I'm picking them up
Let them play with the dick in the truck
Many girls want to put their fists on Jigga
Just because you have a good head
I'm going to break the bread, so can you be living?
Shit, I'm parting with nothing, you guys will be up front
Do I give my heart to a woman?
Cold heart like murderers, I have no passion
I have no patience and I hate waiting
Ho, put your butt in and let's ride!
We're pimpin 'big, we spend cheese
We are making great efforts in New York
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
Nigga, he's the big businessman of southern rap
Coming straight to the black quarter
Makes a mill of a pardon ho
So sit back and look at my sce-nahr-i-o
No i can't catch a fear ho
Now every time, every place, wherever we go
Now these motherfuckers know we carry more
Heat that a little
We don't take it out for little shit
Go read a book, you illiterate motherfucker!
And improve your vocabulary!
Don't be surprised if you stab me
And you see us come down on your 'SLAB
Living in the fabulous ghetto, so angry, you just can't bear it
But black if you hate me
So you wait while I undress your bitch
Just break it; you have to pay as if you weighed
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now bring your butt to the back as I fly to the runway
Timbaland, let me spit out my prose
Pump in the pro zone
That's the track we're breaking these hoes on
It's not the track that we flow on
We keep crispy hoes like Trigger-man
It really doesn't get any bigger, man
Don't stumble, let's turn around, get thrown
We'll be big pimpin ', wasting cheese
We'll be big pimpin 'down at P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
Smoking, pouring
Keeping me leaning on my glass
All my car has leather and wood
In my neighborhood we call it "dollar"
Holla on broads in the mall
If he gets up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with all of you
If I wasn't rapping, baby
I'd still be riding Mercedes
Going down and drinking daily
No registration until Whitey pays me
Uhh, now what do you know about the boys from Texas?
Coming in candied toys
Smoking grass and talking noise
We'll be big pimpin ', wasting cheese
We'll be big pimpin 'down at P.A.T
In the canopy, my resistance be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
I made my money fast, then I went back to the streets
Standing in the corner of my block, rushing
Still getting that caine
Half of what I paid slipping through customs
It will be sold at night, its eggshell is white
I have so many grams, if the man finds out
Will take me to jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin ', wasting cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C and Timothy
We have bitches in the back of the truck
Laughing, Jigga Man: that's what happens!
We'll be big pimpin ', wasting cheese
We're big pimpin 'on B-L-A-D
We'll be big pimpin 'down at P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
Everyone here just bounces
It just bounces
It just bounces
It just bounces
Uh uh uh uh
I like it ok come on
Uh uh
Yes Yes Yes Yes
uh uh uh
Yes Yes Yes Yes
uh uh uh
You know I throw them, I hug them, I love them, I leave them
But I don't trust or need them
The first time you worry, I'm breezing
Speaking, what are the reasons?
I'm a pimp in every way of the word mom
Better to trust and believe in them
In the court where I keep them
So it's "beep beep" and I'm picking them up
Let them play with the crick in the truck
Many girls want to put their fists on Jigga
Divorce it and divide your dollars
Then you can be living
Part with nothing, I'll be out front
Not for nothing, it never happens
Cold heart like assassins, I have no passion, I have no patience
And I hate waiting, why stick your ass in and ride?
Let's ride
Ch ch ch ch
Let's ride
Let's ride
Ch ch ch ch
Ch ch ch ch
What are we doing?
We are doing
Spending cheese we make
Big pimpin 'on LEAVES
We are doing
Big Pimpin 'up in New York
Great pimp
Big pimpin 'on LEAVES
Big Pimpin 'up in New York
It's just that Jigga Man Roots band on MTV
In the canopy, my stamina will be enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
I made my money too long to play with me but I'm
Sitting in the corner of my busy block
Going down from K's, double what I paid
Get it right through customs
Sell your egg shell white at night
I have so many grams if the man finds out
Will take me to jail for life
But I'm still a great pimp, spending cheese
With B.U.N. B, Pimp C and Timothy
We have chickens in the back of the truck, laughing
Jigga Man: that's what happens
Big Pimpin 'Up in New York
It's just that man Jigga B. Sigel Memphis Bleek
Big pimpin spent cheese
And we, big, big, pimpin 'on LEAVES
Big Pimpin 'Up in New York

It's something beautiful that I don't think I can leave tonight. We will have to get out of the building. Do you all sit there? I have to do all kinds of things, reasonable doubt, Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3, Volume 4, Volume 5. Blueprint 1, the Blueprint 2, baby. Do you want some water? Sure sure. Wait. Is it a little hot that you want to share? Wow. It is a beautiful thing. OK
Let's describe a certain female
Let's describe a certain female
(Bitch) you know my name and the company I have
(Bitch) don't try to act like my record isn't known
(Bitch) you probably have a couple of CD's in your house
(Bitch) don't make me say it twice, you're acting all right
All sidez like, like, like you're not (bitch)
I am not a ball player, you will not get pregnant and you will
Before the neighbors go to work
So take off your shirt, don't hit me with that church shit
(Bitch) I have a sister who taught me how to shit chickens
Fooling the fools, I have a whole team of Robin Givens I kick him
They will be jumping guys, how the chickens move, I will also be listening
(Bitch, bitch, bitch)
Don't make me say it three times, you're acting all right
All sidez like, like you're not (bitch)
You're not better because you're not fucking rappers
You only fuck with actors, they still fuck you back
(Bitch) Unless you've fucked a guy on his own merit
Let's describe a certain female
Let's describe a certain female
Let's describe a certain female
Say Jay-Z, why do you have to go and disrespect women, huh?
(Bitch) Sisters get respect, bitches get what they deserve
Sisters work hard, bitches work your nerves
Sisters hold you, bitches hold you
Sisters help you progress, bitches will slow you down
The sisters prepare a meal, play their part with the children.
Bitches on the street with their nose in your business
Sisters tell the truth, bitches tell lies
Sisters drive cars, bitches wanna ride
Sisters do it slow, bitches do it fast
Sisters do their work outside of where they live
Bitches got niggas in your crib
The sisters tell you quickly "better check your friend"
Sisters love Jay because they know what Hov is like
B-I, what's up?
As long as I have a voice, you have a voice, my nigga
Yes sir
BK stand up, Brooklyn raise your hands
If you're with me, lick a drink for Biggie
Chillin 'in place in my B-Boy stance
Don't do this four-fifth kick like the Bruce Lee Roy pants
You know I'm smarter than Spock, for Leonard Nimoy fans
So this foil will thwart your plans, that's how I'm doing it, man
I have two on hand, in case I've been drinking
Seeing twice, I have one for you and your twin
I have a penny for your thoughts, it makes your blood drip
Leave your intelligence on the sidewalk, until the cops come looking for you
I'm done playing with you
Weapons spraying with or without you
Whistle your body without you, Young!
I'm still official without you
Still that nigga all the bitches whisper about, ooh
It's so cool, its lyrics are about you
You can't tell me that everything he spits is not true
He took a lighter, left my name in the hall, Young!
I moved into Marcy's projects when I was five
I had a great-grandmother in the heart of the 'Stuy
So on the fourth of July we always stopped
Man, I ran down the bush, bought pounds from "The Dreads"
Where the niggas would snatch your pockets, leave your change on the floor
18 regime round then, pink houses, niggas from Fort Greene don't mix
It was not safe on train A, D, G or F
Decepticons, Lo-Life niggas take your pole off your chest
East New York, Bushwick, fuck it all BK
Nigga, you better roll deep past Coney Island
Cause it's a way out, nigga, a way in, nigga
Wherever you go, Brooklyn is in the house, if you buckle up
Thieves are in the house, yes, thieves are on the road
The drama is on the way
Look down first, then the flames gon 'spray
But we respect the real, you act like a sheep, you will be the next meal
I have to get in where we fit
Doesn't shed the show and the kids are growing
Baby needs new shoes and you sitting in 22
And you in place bragging like Terrell Owens
Heck i'm in this nigga
You better stay firm if you're a straw house
Then all four will knock him down and he'll go back to the hometown, yeah!
When I was a kid
My father took me to the city
He said, "Son, when you grow up
The beaten and the condemned?
He said, "Will you defeat them?
Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans they have made?
A ghost to guide you in the summer
To join the black parade. "
They say "they never miss you until you die or leave"
In that sense, I'm leaving after the song
So you don't have to feel for Jay that long
At least let me tell you why I'm like this, wait
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnes Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree, what makes me
An M.C. sicker and my mom would claim
Although over the years I gave him his fair share
I gave him his first real scare
I'm not perfect, I care
But I feel useless because my shirts didn't match my outfit
Now I'm just scratching the surface because what's buried there
He was a broken boy once his pop disappeared
I went to school, I got good grades, I could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that arose when faced
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken?
The beaten and the condemned?
Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans they have made?
"Because one day I will leave you
A ghost to guide you in the summer
To join the black parade. "
Now all the teachers could not contact me
And my mom couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match my friends pain at not seeing me, so
With that disdain on my membrane
Fuck the world, my defense came
The Spanish José introduced me to 'caine
My team is in and I'm in the crowd
And all the fair skinned wavy girls are loving me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my loot
I got a Volvo from this girl when her man was bagged
Also, I hit my mom with cash from a program I had
I'm getting ahead, by the way, I could rap
But that was the second for me moving this crack
Give me a second i swear
I will tell about my rap career
Until the '96 came, niggas, I'm here
Goodbye
Would you be the savior of the broken?
The beaten and the condemned?
He said, "Will you defeat them?
Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans they have made?
"Because one day I will leave you
A ghost to guide you in the summer
To join the black parade. "
No two days are the same
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye
And drought will define a man when the well runs dry
You learn the value of water without work, you are thirsty until you die, yes!
And blacks are tied for the product
And the little brothers' ring fingers are cut off
To show mothers that they really have them
And this was the stress that I lived with until I decided
To try this rap shit for a living
I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made
Every sister I played
Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's not anyone's fault I made the decisions I made
This is the life that I chose, or rather, the life that chose me.
(If you can't respect that your whole perspective is crazy
When I was a kid
To see a music band
He said, "Son, when you grow up
Would you be the savior of the broken?
The beaten and the condemned?
He said, "Will you defeat them?
Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans they have made?
A ghost to guide you in the summer
To join the black parade. "
I'm the one you see musically when you want me to be hot
Comparin 'you to me is a lesson in futility, STOP!
Don't worry about plagiarism, it will take years to bite it.
But your biggest fear is that I don't write it
It just appears out of nowhere
Like the information obtained by a psychic
Whether I like it or not, I pay the fees and I hope they pay me back
Why the hell should I freestyle? I get paid for rapping
Tell God someone is doing a good job impersonating you
Jay-Hova spitting Range Rover game
What the hell are they doing in the third lane? GET OVER
Slowly, broken, I sewed it like a tailor
Relatively easy as Jerry Heller
Cream is cherry vanilla has chicks on TV
Belly, it sounds like Mahalia trying to tell everyone
You all know the style, burn the city
And change the locale, I'm doing the same shit, except its legitimacy
It's jigga
I have a cart twenty, better play that shit
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
They said I didn't see twenty but I did that shit
I have a cart twenty, better play that shit
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
I have twenty bags, son, better burn that shit
They said I didn't see twenty but I did that shit
Pimp Gotti gets odds to double
Like kids with tips to top it off
Representing the bomb city in the bill blocks rock microphones
Before they get a million, I sold pills all night
The most illusory thing in life made me think about destiny
Cause even on the nigga tour still ain't sure
I keep a thre eight to my left
Smoke an L for stress that counts the Lex dirt bag
Puff for now, the east side is not represented with tons of weapons
You keep it real where you're from
Because where could you put the dagger on your back
My mind totin ', fuck it, bend over
I have a cart twenty, better play that shit
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
I have twenty bags, son, better burn that shit
They said I didn't see twenty but I did that shit
I have a cart twenty, better play that shit
I have twenty bags, son, better burn that shit
They said I didn't see twenty but I did that shit
Berg shit, shit word, waste with scrilla
Watch when you work spitting bird shit killer
Do not be bothered with, herbal distributor
Can you make me all feel really tickin 'knock
Busting a rapper busting a scammer cap stop flinchin '
Fresh out of the corner calling dog shit brog shit
As soon as you feel that shit, you'll be like oh shit (stoooooop)
Broke niggas turn the glass looking
Facing the ass whoopin 'track
In front of the black class prostitute, the fat ass
The past is never the last to teach lessons
Beer doesn't become a preaching, I'll be blessing
Many children come out the wrong way like caesarean sections
Know that the brother is gone, even if he crosses shorts
Fuck coca cola coca because shit costs more
But niggas say I floss a lot
But when I take it off and they say I lost my touch
Those bitches like the money I use
How funny they look
Silly bunnies with little glows
Shorty, let me see the tail if it's really that fucking
My boy hit that shit now every wounded body
What I'm talking about gloves, for real
I have a cart twenty, better play that shit
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
I have twenty bags, son, better burn that shit
They said I didn't see twenty but I did that shit
I have a cart twenty, better play that shit
You owe me twenty baby better pay that shit
I have twenty bags, son, better burn that shit
They said I didn't see twenty but I did that shit
Travel with speed limit
I sit back, eager to bag a bitch who wants a bag
Better to be born a bullet, she will fill you with wit
Short! Dog! Bay area !!!
Uh! Ask my black Lebron!
We are so big we don't have to answer
When you speak with a gift
We let the money speak
Another hundred and fifty million, doesn't it sound like we're screaming?
Who the hell overrated?
If they paid you something wrong
Hatin that will only make him spend the night
Out of spite with the girl you've been dancing
We are the best of the best
We will be here so that the rest can rest
I have to get this off my chest
No pause, none of that shit, get your dick down!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!! (It is very easy for me!)
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
Will take seven Will movies (What's up Will?)
Seven movies for twenty thousand '
And you're still missing ten of what I did with a deal (Damn it!)
Don't compare me to anyone
I'd rather not be mentioned, I'm offended
Unless you're talking about Sinatra, James Dean or
John Lennon (o) or Jimi Hendrix
I'm just a rock star, BEEYITCH !!
Keep it real, you know I have them all BEEYITCH !!
We are not in the same league
You could lie to yourself, you can't lie to me (uh-uh, uh-uh!)
I do not even know your name
I'm too big for you, rap Lebron James
Roc Nation, the new movement
And all of you funny money, what the hell are you doing?
I don't know what they are up to
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
BLOW THE WHISTLE!!!
Blow the whistle!
Roc-A-Fella Records
The Imperial Skateboard P
Great hova
You already know what it is! (Oh shit!)
Come on! (Woooo!)
I could triple that in birds
Open your mind, you see the circus in the sky
I'm Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey with the cakes
No matter how you cut it, I'm your motherfucker
And just like a b-boy with 360 waves
Do the same with the pot, it still turns beige
Either right or left handed, either the pot or the jar
Whip, it still comes back hard
So easily I make W-H-I-P
My repetition with the dolls will bring the kilo offer
Who slipped, became prisoners, trees glued to visitors
Unnecessary commissioner, boy, we live this shit
Niggas wanna bring back the 80s
Except I don't write on the wall
I write my name in the history books, running down the hall
No i don't turn my head
And I get it, I get it
I'm not talking about it, I'm living it
I get it, I get it straight
Ge-ge-ge-get, do it, boy
Don't waste your time fighting life
Follow your course and you will understand
Get it boy
It's the 87 state of mind I'm in (mind that I'm)
At my best, then for that time, I am Rakim (I am Rakim)
If it wasn't for the crime I was in
But I wouldn't be the type that rhymes, it's that I'm inside (that I'm inside)
No pain, no profit
Q, I repeat if you show me where the pot is (pot is)
Cherry M3's with the top back
G reds and greens are in my hat
North Beach leathers, matching Gucci sweater
Whatever, one hundred for the diamond chain
Blame Reagan for turning me into a monster
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra
Before these rhyming things we were in concert
And I get it, I get it
I get it, I get it straight
Ge-ge-ge-get, do it, boy
Don't waste your time fighting life
Get it boy
Uhh, push (push ...)
Money on top, you got it, fuck you Bush
Chef (chef), guess what I cooked?
I baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books
Rockstar (rockstar), look
Long before the bars, my photo was being taken
As much as they tried, they couldn't hook me, uhh
Because the fish scale is in my veins like a Pisces
Pyrex pot, rolled up
Turn one into two like a Siamese twin
Never dying on your knees, the last of a dying race
I partied for a while, now I'm back on the block
And I get it, I get it
I'm not talking about it, I'm living it
I get it, I get it straight
Ge-ge-ge-get, do it, boy
Follow your course and you will understand
Get it boy
Like Pepsi, that's a brand
I'm behind it, I guarantee it.
They know that even if they don't know me more than they know, General Mills President ... my man
"JAY-Z this", "JAY-Z that".
("JAY-Z won't take my hand anymore")
"JAY-Z this", "JAY-Z that".
"JAY-Z that", "JAY-Z this".
Get out of JAY-Z 'dick!
What, you niggas get front page items?
(Is this thing on?) JAY-Z, JAY-Z
(Verify) In the news of JAY-Z
I understand what they are trying to do
Although this time I brought the flutes (See)
Unleash the flutes on them, Guru
Let's go to the procedures that precede this afternoon
Come on!
H-O-V-A
No, no, don't be afraid
All of you and your articles spit on Jay
All of you from afar threw darts in my direction
What did you think, would I have nothing to say? No!
They all fell into the explosive trap
And now you can't go
You opened the door, God, I'm with you annually
I call things by their name, it just is what it is
But you can't believe what he says
The same guy who gives you ice and you owe him some head
Shorty, it's time to wake up the dead
You sound a bit naive in the articles I read
H-O-V-A
The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
Got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
H-O-V-A
Got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
Prophesying on your CDs and tapes
I will not break you a crumb of what little he does
And with whom do you want to put your faith?
When the Twin Towers fell, I was first in line (it's real)
Donatin 'comes from every ticket sold
When I was on the road, that's how you judge Hov, isn't it?
Am I not supposed to be absorbed in myself?
Whenever there is a tragedy, I am the first to help
But they don't call me the guy to take their dollars to give gifts on projects
These guys are all politicians, depositing checks
They put in his pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip (Yap, yap, yap)
And you buy the shit, caught up in the hype
Because black wears a kufi, it doesn't mean he is shiny
It just means you don't understand all the shit he writes (What the hell are you saying?)
Is it Oochie Wally Wally or is it One Mic?
Is it Black Girl Lost or shorty do I owe you ice?
I've been real all my life, mistake it for vanity
Since I'm not going to lose, they try to help him cheat
But I will not lose, because even in defeat
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it equals me
When the grass is mowed, the snakes will show
Although I have to thank little friend Nas for that (Ha ha)
Saving me the trouble of talking to half of these assholes
My mom can't save you this time, niggas it's history
Who do you know flows vicious like me?
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov '
I get the loot because the winner is me (Me, black!)
Your street dreaming, all of you niggas living through me
I gave you life when niggas was forgetting you master of ceremonies
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me
You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee
And little friend Jungle is a garden for me.
What is the problem, B? You're not as hard as me, nigga
Tough like us, black, R-O-C, black
Why follow me
You want war, so this war is going to be, nigga
H-O-V-A
The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
H-O-V-A
Got my mojo back, baby, oh behave
H-O-V-A
The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way
H-O-V-A
Yes Yes Yes
Ugh, correct, correct, correct
Alright alright alright alright
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Mommy loved me, Pop left me
Mickey fed me, Annie dressed me
Eric fought me, made me harder
I love you for that, my nigga; no matter what, bruh
Marcy raised me, and if it's right or wrong
Streets gave me everything I write in this song
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life
East Trenton made me grow, made me miss school
Mom raised me; Pop i miss you
God help me to forgive him; I have some problems
Mickey wiped my ears, Annie washed my hair
Eric was flying ... Shit, I used to steal his gear
I was the boy; I couldn't do anything wrong
The years pass quickly; let's keep going
Kitchen table: that's where I honed my skills
The labels rejected me, I couldn't foresee
Clark looked for me, he believed give me
Primo tied me; Ski too
Reasonable classic of doubt, should have tripled
Mommy loved me, Pop left me
Grandma dressed me and also fed me
The banana pudding was in the hood then
Inhaling Ls, drinking pink Champale
Ty rolled with a nigga, V.A. stain
Tone, Mike 'Zo and those niggas, V.A. is blocked
Biggs fucked with a nigger, what's up Hoff?
Bee-High hated the fact that I put rap on my back
The money is coming, the clientele is growing now
Birth of my first nephew; time to stop it
October 21: Lavelle came into the world
Followed by three more boys and then a girl
Mom loved me; Ti-Ti, Uncle Jay ...
He loves you to death; I won't let any trouble come your way
He went until November, how can I not remember him?
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tremble
Unless it was me, how could you judge me?
I was raised in pain, you can't touch me
The police chased me, chased me, handcuffed and subdued.
He spoke rude to me because I am young, rich and black
And live a movie, not live by the rules
Bleek, you're still with me, nigga, what did I say?
Beans, I'm not trying to change you, just give you a game
Make the transition from the street to fame.
My mom loves me ...
Everything, all this, my only thing
All I hear is my answer
I never hear that, I'm in the gang
I never saw a roof in all my life
Everything I saw, everything is rotten
You never feel silent, innocent is Carter
Innocent we look for them
I and I say we see them
Boom Shakalaka, Boom Shakalaka
Boom Shakalaka, Boom Shakalaka
Everything in shaka, everything in faka
Everything in shaka, everything in faka
I have bloodlines in Benin, that explains voodoo
And thank God for BB, his Creole roots run deep
Because we are family
We we family
Because more than ever we will have to be together, do you feel me?
I was in Havana when that was forever prohibited, do you feel me?
Fuck embargoes, I'm a narco
Colombian ties, shout at Dapo
OG Juan too
Because we are family
Feel me?
Lagos, all the neighborhoods around me, do you feel me?
We we family
Viet Cong never did shit on me, do you feel me?
I'm in London art clubs drinking tea, can you feel me?
I'm at Michelangelos at FT
Because we are family
We, we, we, family, do I feel?
Yes! It's the collection!
It's your boy S. Dot
Yes! I will take this time to talk to you about The Black Album very quickly
It's a prequel to all my ... uh ... all my albums
They are the activities that led to my first album in '96
It's like the book ends for the entire career ... you know
Let's take it all the way back
It's mob time around '88 to '94, maybe 95 '
All the things that lead to songs like Friend or Foe or D'Evils, you know what I mean?
Do you know all those activities, do you know what I'm saying? Yes
It's your boy Hov!
The game is wrong, the business niggas are making fun and it's okay ...
We have to put integrity back into music man
You know what I'm talking?
Check it out!
There are rules for this shit, consult the OG
Before you guys make a move on the strip
Before moving the lip, remove the tool from your hip
I'll show you how to do this shit
I will tell you what kind of car to buy
What kind of shoes to buy?
You have to treat her well if she mules your shit
Do you know the kind of damage that love could do?
If she feels that they are taking advantage of her? Ouu!
Standing like a short girl I guess?
Here I will train you, Young is not fake like most guys
Youth move weight like Cool J's trainer is obvious
And don't wear a vest without a banger
That just makes you a target
Young used to run the block, now I corner the market
'86 your shit, man get smart boy
But you don't want to make a small offer
Imprisoned with hard heads, acting like your hard head
That's all dead, get you the pig's head
Cheese, we could all get, R.S.V.P
Man we used to play dolls here
Niggas wet with the tap, come on and run your car
Until I became one, now I have bedding in the closet
I have the plan, you just have to follow it
Rule number one, true niggas never gossip
Rule number two, own The Black Album, you have to copy it
Yeah man, we'll just bring him back to the game man
Black album, point S
Is the collection
First non-athlete with a shoe
I know you love me, you just don't know how to tell me
However, everything is fine, I love you all too
You're your boy, Guru, fade away
So I had to memorize these rhymes until I got home
You understand? You know, once you memorize a prayer
It's like an exercise
You all niggas can't be serious right now
I am the flower champion of all time.
I am leading the league in at least six statistical categories right now:
Better flow, more consistent and real stories
More charisma, I set most trends
And my interviews are hotter! Holla!
I jog in the cemetery, I train in the same ring
That was hosted by the building where Malcolm X was killed.
Execute suicide exercises over and over again
With the weight of the world on my shoulder
So they call me "Hova"
I'm far from God, but I work very hard
I wake up the birds so when the nerds sleep
I'm focused, man, and I'm not afraid of death.
And I'm going to go out, I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (I run), I lift in a fall (pull)
I keep jumping, thirty six games
Billy Blanks from the ghetto, I'll show you niggas what pain is
Maintain your resistance, Hov will harm you
I see you two rhymes, all you niggas are amateurs
The fifth, a dead elevator if niggas don't wanna get shot
It is not necessary to go to the showers, the saliva of the fifth leaves you wet
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
(and) four, breathe easy ...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy ...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
One, two, three, four, breathe easy
Suckers, lift your weight, not your hate
Jigga man is diesel when I lift the eight
They are not ready to train with the child
Your flow is the brain with drugs, mines is rap with steroids
I raise every voice when I sing, my ability
Make yours seem like a useless exercise
Bring your squad, biceps, triceps and quads
You are all not real, that's the Achilles heel
The same routine when you see me you know the exercise
I see you, I lift the weight of the clock
Outside your arm, stay calm and nice
Drop your things, game trinity
Know my way around your ring
It sounds the same as always
R-O-C is the strongest team, motherfuckers
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy ...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy ...
One (and, and, and) one
Two (and, and, and) two
Three (and, and, and) three
(and) four, breathe easy ...
One, two, three, four, breathe easy
Yes, purse, pile, man
Bet the same
Oh I have the next one, man
Do you have the money, man? Your handsome ass, black ass
Shit is right down in the trunk
Don't stumble; We park one behind the other, nigga
I'm gonna get the shit before I go down
Yes, aight, what about that case, man?
Aw man it's nothing
Still sitting in seven digits, unlike you, you broke your black ass
Get out of here, this cat right here
This broke the ass, the ass, the ass, the nigga
Betting five thousand I have no money
Chili Cheese Face Ass Nigga (Fuck You)
(Laughter)
These motherfuckers talk fucking
That shit back like they're cooking crack
All I want my green pockets as slum change
You know what I'm talking?
In front of the roll, we go back like rubbers, motherfucker, really
No trace of AIDS
Roc-A-Fella clique, black
Ayo, we caress Sugar Hill's pussy at the Shark Bar
Looking for aspirin when I ascend, we sway
You hold on, we do our thing and bring
The East Coast host is colossal hostile
Al Pacino to Nino Brown
Me, Jay and Primo, I sewed it across the board like Poquino
Teflon, make sure your jam is full
With my man I will supply some G's, now it is unstoppable cheese
Amazing street knowledge for academics when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals
Fuck with guns, just to see my shit, download pus
I have to tell everything about Roc-A-Fella
Yes bring it if you think you can hang up
And if not then let me do my thing
And if not then let me do my thing
And if not then let me do my thing
On a scourge with money, organized crime like the Pharoahe
I cream, I shine diamond
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown demon for Jay-Z to appear on stage
Meanwhile, here's something silly for everyone to lean on
Link for days and days
Can I live, I made dough with my nigs, dividends flow
Like the Mississippi Riv ', which looks like a template
I can't do it for intent, I had to walk away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought it was O.G. Bobby johnson
I played it like Benny Blanco, hand in hand
You're not ready, I stroke the trigger up, I shoot my guns
Horizontal, lift your weight, I am
You only have one hundred and twenty-five grams
I wouldn't expect them to understand this money
Make the knowledge, because of a few dollars, I will demolish
Brooklyn crews through Hollis to a hood near you, what the hell?
Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit
I make movements that remove the pebbles from my shoes.
You suck a gun like a pipe with the glass
John Stockton couldn't help you
Convoys of Benzes like us dirtying at the UN
So what the hell are you doing? Whatever, nigga
Fahrvergnügen, strong but polished
Dollar spanking with commas
Beating up the bitches in the Bahamas
In llama skins we don't cry at all, we fly further
Fry hotter, you'll die, fuck me witness tomorrow
Call Cousin Now Dallas Activates Finger With Callus
The tip is escalated from the mail to keep these niggas out of balance
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put pure brown sugar before dirty green cream
Yes bring it if you think you can hang up
And if not then let me do my thing
Yes bring it if you think you can hang up
And if not then let me do my thing
Yes bring it if you think you can hang up
Yes bring it if you think you can hang up
And if not then let me do my thing
Yes go ahead go ahead
Go ahead, if you think, if you think, if you think
Nickels and dimes, kilos and nines
I have the formula for success: get yourself
A kilo of Bobbito, then get yourself a couple of people
And we can make this work, never let niggas try to shake
If they do, put them on the ground and then get dark
Now get your property somewhere to house these
Take a [?] Now it's time to flip them like Micky D's
Take your baking soda and your triple beam
Not too much soda, I have to keep it powerful enough to cripple demons
And keep them running, coming back; keep your gun in your lap
In case these niggas try to steal your crack, there won't be any of that
Just make sure like Comstock, nothing better
-Tor, move fast to have an empty box
When you start to see mass, make that fireproof sentinel safe
Hustling 101 welcome to class
You will learn the art of dealing with history and making broken English your math
Every dollar as my last, cause it could be
I stay away from the hoochies who love Gucci and Louis
Vuitton - the Don, before spending: do me
With a couple of O's who keep drinking bottles of rosé
And now we celebrate living life because hell can wait
What about rap, rappers always wonder, "What?"
While you were on the promotional tour, I was home laughing
The fireproof sentinel sure if we die from loot
Loosening up the game, I can't make it happen
Copy some cracks and get back on the map and
You got that shit they want, need, must have when they wear
Before they try Larry Davis, let's go public
I can't see my future from the street, so I live for now
I have to be legitimate before they hear my name too much in the center
I try to get out of this shit as soon as I start packing
Every time I try to quit this game, I go back inside
Think bags because I never had shit
I have to get mine, even if it means
That's all I know, so that's all I wrote
On December 3, the day before my 44th birthday, I will embark on a 22-day challenge to become completely vegan, or as I prefer to call it, plant-based! This all started a few months ago when a good friend and vegan challenged me to accept a "herbal breakfast" every day. It was surprisingly easier for me than I thought ...
Because right now? There is something spiritual for me that is my 44th birthday and the chance behind the number of days in this challenge; 22 (2 + 2 = 4) along with the fact that the challenge ends on Christmas Day ... It just feels good!
Then you can call it a spiritual and physical cleansing. I'll post my progress ... Any professional vegan who has good places to eat please help! Please ha. I don't know what happens after Christmas. A complete, plant-based, semi-vegan diet? Or just a spiritual and physical challenge? We'll see…
Good luck and health!
PD B also joins me.
I will let my friend Marco explain the benefits of a plant based diet here.
Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn— Brooklyn
Come on hard
Brooklyn, let's go hard, let's go hard (Agh!)
Brooklyn, let's go hard, let's go hard
Brooklyn, let's go hard, let's go hard
Brooklyn, let's go hard, let's go hard
Brooklyn, let's go hard, let's go hard
This is black hoodie rap
There is no fear in my eyes where they look
Better look on the map
Also, I don't like to fight
No, I think such a thing is worth a man's life (Christ!)
But if a man tries my Stuy
I promise you will not like my answer
Boom-bye-bye, like Buju, I'm crucial
Chain snatching, I don't have it, I gotta get it
The same shiddit, from Brownsville to Bainbriddidge
Fatherless boy, mom did double shifts
So the number runners were the only ones I hung up
Before you know it, I'm in the game, bang fiddith
Don't fear the orangutans, ask for the ciddaps
Please! Tell me what's the name of this shit
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
Jack, robbery, sin
Aw man I'm Jackie Robinson
'Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Fortunately, fortunately, they did not understand me
Now when I bring the nets, I'm the Black Branch Rickey
From the corners of Brooklyn, burning sticky branches
Spread love, Biggie; Brooklyn hippie
I feel sorry for the fool with jewelry like Mr. T
No history in my district, they borrow
The sun doesn't rise for many, like Annie
Half an orphan, mom never had an abortion
Dad did it; I still managed to live
I'm going hard, I owe everything to the crib
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (B-R, O, O-K)
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard (L-Y, N, come again)
While I'm doing my time due to circumstances
Cross that bridge, face the consequence
Once I bid ten, now I paid my dues
Risk takers, we break the rules
Darken, but I see well
Bed-Stuy stays high in my neck of the woods
Now let it ring it's a warning
(Brooklyn!) Make it sworn
I have to make it work like us, blue collar
Break it to the core, underneath everything that's more difficult
Right on the clip, take it to the floor
One step, one step, surrender more
The road is hard and the street is a disaster.
Stealing commercial stash
Kill the voice screaming in my head
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard
Little punk ass shit, that's black (laughs)
What's going on?
I guess men lie, women lie
But the numbers don't
It's over for that ball
Brooklyn!
We fly high, it's not a lie, you know (Brooklyn!)
Foreign walks, outside, it's like show business (it's my turn)
We fly away, we don't lie, you know (Brooklyn!)
Hips and thighs, oh, stay focused
Brooklyn gets paper, carries big things
Give me the chain, it's over for you ladies
Kidnap mine?
Nigga, I'll click and bang your wig beyond Tyra Banks' hairline
Your bank versus mine
The Joneses can't keep up
Maybe my nigga Nas, but I got stronger after Ether
We fly high, it's not a lie, you know (Brooklyn!)
We fly away, we don't lie, you know (Brooklyn!)
Stuy Bed, Brownsville, CI
The best in the game since dad Kane and B.I
My turn, we live, money to burn, nigga we're on fire
G-5'er, ace of sword
Make it really easy to reserve your baby
I run a Boston with these niggas
I'm watching you Sounds, you can keep reniging
I am strong, I am like Trump
I'm on my way to a billi, I play my cards right
Niggas like "Hov, you sound too good!"
I'm like "Oh! Isn't that a bitch thing?"
Isn't that why we are here? Thus
I'm playing for real, you pump pretending
We fly high, it's not a lie, you know (Brooklyn!)
Foreign walks, outside, it's like show business (it's my turn)
We fly away, we don't lie, you know (Brooklyn!)
Hips and thighs, oh, stay focused
145 and all that
All Dominicans, OG Juan, Lower Eastside Tru-Life
It's game time, hehe
It's my turn
Let the games begin
YOUNG!
* shots * OK, I'm recharged !!!
Sons of a bitch, do you think big?
Fuck Jay-Z, you're going to die, big time!
Here comes the "pain"! *gunshots*
Nigga, how do you imagine ... (how do you imagine)
Yes Yes Yes
Question number one is if the feds can catch us (uh-huh)
I have vendettas in dice games against gamblers (uh-huh)
And niggas who pump wheels and drive Jettas
Take that with you
I hit you, I separated you (uh)
Fuck fist fights and silly fights (uh)
Pillow case on your face, make the shell muffle (woo)
Fuck a fight, nickel plated
Sprinkle cocaine on the floor, make it drug related (haha)
While you guys pump Willie, I run and make a fool of myself (uh-huh)
Scared, so you sent your little men to kill me (uh)
"What is your name?"
Who shot you? Mafia ties like Sinatra (uh)
The Peruvians tried to get me in, I still haven't paid them
Rolex and bracelets is Frostbit; it sounds too
Niggas on the way, call me Igloo, who?
Motherfucker!
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit your drawers
(Where are you from?) Brooklyn, dating for everyone
(Marcy ...) That's right, you don't stop
(Bed-Stuy ...) Won't you stop (nigga!)
What what what?
Brooklyn represents them all, hit your fold
You're crazy, do you think your little rhyme can touch me?
I'm from Marcy, I'm from the varsity team, silly, you're JV
Biggie baby! (uh!)
Fuck three wishes, I made my way to wealth
Gram choppin ', police van dockin'
Ds at my doors knocking (what?)
Keep rocking yeah
Shit back with the guns burning
Hot like Cajun (uh)
Hotter than even having a job at the Days Inn
With New York license plates outside
Get out of there! Fuck the ride!
Keep your hands up, the shit gets steeper (uh!)
Here comes the Grim Reaper, Frank White!
Leave the keys of your InnKeeper (That's right)
You have more medications than a pharmacy
You are not hurting me, so forgive me
Pass the safe, before the place burns
And here are six shots just in case
("Brooklyn ... Brooklyn ... Brooklyn ...")
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit your drawers
(Where are you from?) Brooklyn going to everyone
(Crown Heights ...) You don't stop
(Ha ha!) Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit in your drawers
(Where are we from?) Brooklyn going to everyone
(Bushwick ...) You don't stop
(Fort Greene ...) You won't stop (Niggas!)
Yes Yes Yes
For '9-6, the only MC with the flu
Yeah sick rhyme I'm what you're trying to do
Made a fortune in Peru, extradite, white porcelain kettle
Stay out of my way from now on (Erase?) (Uh!)
I have to go, Coolio means it's getting too hot
Get it? You ... Pac's?
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Time to separate the pros from the cons (y-uh)
Bronze platinum
That soft butter shit from that leather in the Fonz (uh)
A class I S1 diamond
A sip Chandon of a black Rosé, huh?
Brook-Nam, drinking
Throwing you crazy slugs through your nautical
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit and drawers
(Red Hook ...) That's right, you won't stop (nigga!)
("Brooklyn ... Brooklyn ... Brooklyn ...")
Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls, nigga shit your drawers
(East New York ...) You don't stop (Woo-ee!)
("Brooklyn ... Brooklyn ... Brooklyn ... Brooklyn ...")
"Brooklyn is in the house?"
Uhh, Roc-A-Fella you guys, Junior M.A.F.I.A
Camarilla of supermen
Brooklyn's Finest, you rewind this
Yes guru
Let's have a little fun with this
I have another
Nigga, your shit is trash
When I see you I will hit your ass
I don't give a shit about any magazine
You see me black: bling, bling, bling
Take it to the bridge
Out of the trunk, trunk trunk
Better stop fucking
You're gonna make me chase your coward's butt
With the pump, pump, pump
I entered this game
Wanting more paper than Puff
Last week Bleek puffed up the paper Puff
And Beans buys a Bentley every week
In addition to Miami real estate is highway robbery
Wars cost, I need weapons for my robberies
I'm buying tanks, if you're thinking it's just rap
Don't go too far in that verse
Get all your chest collapsed
It's just the facts
God bless cats who think I'm a liar
Pick up a nigga of paper, read my background
"Just back off!"
Not until my salary is like the real Mike Lowry
Everything I say I do, you can feel my words now
You don't even know me and you're crazy
Now I know exactly what it feels like to be a Laker.
With a keyless ignition, eating Chow's
A Nobu nigga, merci beaucoup
I'm in France, I meant Japan
What the hell is wrong with you?
Everyone wants to know my net worth
Niggas wake up on my dick, eat breakfast first
I'm a legend, I haven't even left this Earth
I don't care about any vest, when that TEC hurts
Turning that Lexus upside down
Making your next whip a hearse
It is best to keep it in the verse
But I'm an outcast, nigga
So I have to keep a piece
So when it bothers you and surprises you, it's a security breach
Don't make me get to the breaking point
I hit you, blank
This is not a movie dog!
Out of the trunk, trunk trunk
Better stop fucking
You're gonna make me chase your coward's butt
With the pump, pump, pump
Young!
The black album is on the way
I know you heard my steps
Than?
Well fuck you ... bitch
Now you can bounce with me, wit with me, wit with me wit
Can you bounce with me, bounce with me, wit with me?
Can you bounce with me, bounce with me, ye-ye-yeah?
Uh-huh uh-huh bounce off me, bounce off me
You can now you can you can bounce with me, bounce with me
Ge-gi, ge-gi-gi-gi-geyeah bounce off me, bounce off me
Get it!
Bitches kill in case you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun rise off the coast of Thailand
Would you ride then if I wasn't driving?
If it wasn't an eight-figure nigga called Jigga
Would you come around me or make me a clown?
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could you?
Look at yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
If you couldn't see yourself with a black when his mass is low
Girl, if this is so, I
Can i catch you
Who does not love hoes, do not receive dough
Can i get a woop woop
Can i catch you
To these bitches of all my niggas

Who has no love for blacks without dubbing?
Bounce with me, bounce with me

Bounce with me, bounce with me
Uhh, bounce off me
You can now you can you can bounce with me, bounce with me
Yeah uh-uh uh uh
You don't have to be rich, but fuck that
Before I put this pussy on your mustache
Can you pay me My niggas a breadwinner, never cheesy
Ambition makes me so horny
Not the fuss and the front
If you have nothing, baby, better
Get up, get out and get something, shit
I really like Prada, Alizé and vodka.
Late at night, by candlelight, then I break my cock
I have to break them, drop them and then hit you
Feel the juice, then I have you - when you produce a rock
Never try my patience, nigga, I'm high maintenance
High class, if you are not rolling, avoid
If you're not holding on, I throw you
Can i catch you
To these bitches of all my niggas
To these niggas from all my bitches
Who has no love for blacks without dubbing?
Can i catch you
Who does not love hoes, do not receive dough
Can i get a woop woop
To these niggas from all my bitches
Who has no love for blacks without dubbing?
Now you can bounce for me, bounce for me
Uhh
You can now you can you can bounce with me, bounce with me
Gi-gi-gi-geyeah-geyeah
You can bounce with me, bounce with me
Uhh!
Uhh! Yes
It's not even a question
How my dough flows, I'm good with these bad hoes
Like my wet cat like wet clothes
What you all niggas don't know: it's easy to clean a hoe
Bitches better have my money for 'sho'
Before they run, they say, touting how
I'm going crazy, they back off, they go to the head, they let it out
I fuck with my Gat outside, bounce and leave a hundred
Making them feel, bitch even if they don't want it
It's been so long, ever since I met a girl it's not about fries, but then I'm
Too bad, when I say "go"
So hold on to the feeling of flossing and plat-num
Because from now on, you can witness Ja the swindler
With sweatshirts and Timbs on, cause I killed my bitches
VV studs my bitches, then we steal niggas bitch
I am talking about straight figures, if you are here, you are with us
Can i catch you
To these bitches of all my niggas
Can i get a woop woop
Who has no love for blacks without dubbing?
Can i catch you
Who does not love hoes, do not receive dough
Can i get a woop woop
To these niggas from all my bitches
Now you can bounce with me, bounce with me
Ge-gi, ge-gi-gi-gi bounce off me, bounce off me
Bounce, bitch, bounce ... wit me wit wit me

Ge-gi, uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
Uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh
You can bounce with me bounce with me
Geyeah
I want to go back 98
A couple of successes
Help me
Can you bounce with me
Can you bounce with me
Left side, can you bounce with me with me?
In the middle you can bounce with me
Help me
Can I hit in the morning without giving you half of my dough?
And worse yet, if I was bankrupt, would you love me?
If I couldn't get you finer things like all diamond rings
Would you ride then if I wasn't driving?
If it wasn't for the name of
Would you come around me or make me a clown?
If it couldn't flow futuristically, would you?
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could you?
See yourself working harder nine to five
After ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a to buy and destroy the mall?
Brag, tell your friends what I bought you
If you couldn't see yourself with a player when his mass is low
Can I get a (whoop whoop)
To all my thugs who do not love those who have no mass
Can I get a (whoop whoop)
To all my ladies, uh, uh
Can I get a (whoop whoop)
To all my players who do not love those who have no mass
Uh uh
Now you can bounce with me
You can bounce with me with me with me
Can you bounce with me
Bounce bounce bounce
Yes, yes, yes, Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to something epic, you know?
Well we run away from a feeling of hopelessness
Through that despair, we become addicted
Kind of like the demons we're used to serving
But we feel we have nothing to lose
So we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right?
What do you bring to the table?
While I'm looking at every nigga looking at me closely
My shit is butter for bread, they want to toast me
I keep my head, the two of us, where they're supposed to be
Hoes will deflect it, then clap from nearby feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel connected like codeine, these days
A brother has to admire me four demons away.
My pain, I wish it was quick to see
From selling '' caine '' until the brains are fried to a fricassee
I can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, getting my thug in correctly
My squad and I don't respect authority
Laughing loudly, happy to escape poverty, however brief
I know this game has valleys and peaks
Expectations of dives, of precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth that used to be, soon to see a million
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Illin 'for revenue, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, Seven Round Jewels, Dead Head on Microphone
Forgetting everything I knew, convenient amnesia
"I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure."
Lock my body, I can't catch my mind
I'd rather die huge than live asleep, that's how we do it
Live in the main event, I bet a trip to Maui
Presidential Suites my residential for the weekend
Talking confidentially in codes since I feel like you're looking
NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We're both out of town, dog, what are you trying to get into?
In this way, no Fraud Willies presents the game that they upload again
And we can have a nice time, drinking margaritas
Ge-ge-geyeahhh
I can live?
I can live?
My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circulate
Like a Lexus, if you drive badly, it will surely hurt you
Dual level as duplex, in unit
In tangible goods, Rolex platinum
We do not rent, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, a dead nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of said patient
When it boils with steam, it reaches it
All the demons, we have to do it: even the right minds go through this
This is true, the streets teach us to spend our silly money
Liaise with jewelers and watch out for intruders
I went up another level, I meditated like a Buddhist
"Let's do this", it becomes tedious
So I keep an eye open like CBS: You look stressed out, right?
I can live?
I can live?
I can live?
I can live?
You plan to hit, I plan to hit too
You say my name to entertain your crew
I'm not playing any game, when the exchange of shots has finished you
Fresh out of probation, I have a charge to drop
My lawyer says that for eighty grand it will disappear
And that's not money for Jay
So you can have a broad day on Broadway while TRL is playing
You play the game, you know you won't win
Stop playing children's games with adult men
I don't care about chrome cars or wheels
I have apartments where you can put your house
I can live?
Don't put my verse on all your records!
The boy catches money like bear hunters
Dear Summer, I know you will miss me
Because we've been together like Nike Air and crisp shirts
S. Dot's and Polo Fleece's
Purple label with secret logo
Give me a couple of years, shhh, it could sneak in
A few words and I like Peaches and herbs
We will meet and you will feel so good
Well i do this in my dream summer
I'm not one of these half-newcomers, you know how my summer is going
I drop the heat when you bring the sun
The combo make the niggas act up, take the gun
Niggas back off, they know I'm not a border
I don't talk shit, I just turn and "Des"
I'm not making you the butt of my jokes
Let's not stray from what I came to say
For my beloved, I think we need some time away
They say if you love it
If he returns, you must know that he is there to stay
From the public, he should have given me the Pulitz '
But instead they gave me my ass to kiss
But you know me, pounding until the coffin sinks
But still the light shines on all my companions
I know they are weird, some weird, I still want you to share
In all the success I get, I know you can't believe
I still love them but they don't love me
They like the drunk guy in you
{Laughing}
Even though they limp, it's still the same, you still love them the same
Like when cats make subliminal records
I know they can't direct me directly, I don't respect it
And you really don't want it with Hov for the record
I put a couple of races on hold: you could be the next boy
You keep entering the danger zone
You'll make that Hov boy put your name on a song
If you're hungry for a motherfucker of fame, come on!
Say when, take ten steps and turn
But on another note, I'm about to take another vacation on another ship
Damn motherfucker got out of the hood
And I pray that I stay out forever
But any day you know a nigga could try to play like him Suge
So I have to shoot like the Dutch Schultz
You pass the Dutch, I will exploit you, trust me
I'm in a good groove
And I'm not trying to ruin my thing
Me, I'm going to stop Flex, I don't want anyone to catch feelings
I had to take off my jacket, loosen my tie
Enter the cabin, Superman is alive
{Laughing}
Yes, are you done, niggas?
I have your little radio game, your little BDS, huh?
Did you end up black? Huh huh, they all ended
I can live, huh
Can I live, are you being stingy with the fucking music again?
I, I ... I pass out, I take out the MAC
I scream "what is that?", Then I applaud
I have my plot and my fall, through the rot
Feeling it (feeling it), chickens are ice roasting it
Police arresting him, Jigga reacts militant
Speed up, the officer told me to turn off the beat
I raised it one level higher, then returned devil fire
I grew up different, I react in situations where niggas lie stiff
Rookies blame the age difference
My subliminal flows create criminal odes
Sing if they're with me until the end of the road
I'm cynical when I'm in public view.
And this is because I am defensive when I am in interviews
The percentage that does not understand is higher than the percentage that understands
Check yourself, what percentage are you?
Can I live for all my niggas with all the whites in the Air Force?
Stand with your legs bowed like a bulldog, you know what I mean, huh?
Can I live, all the cee-lo champions
Two green and one red dice stop the bank and roll, heads, I
Can I live for all my niggas who drink Hennessy directly?
Copy mixtapes and sell weight, niggas
I have the feds sending me letters, because I'm educating young people
Why is it? Why don't you try to visit the neighborhoods where I live?
Where the police lock you up rather than trying to defend you
I take you to the limit when I need the wealth
I found the little boy jumping down the avenue
On his way to mathematics
He proceeded to show me a slab block and said
There is money out there, I just have to have
When I reach these demons, I hit them in the ass
So as not to show off, sometimes I look at my life and laugh
How I think about school and taught me not to grab
When I stepped back let one out let the barrel spin
That credit you killed
About a drug addict before reading Donald Goines
Flipping boy and using the correct cut
This slab has to go back up and replace
Once I have it, I have it, I close it, nobody exploits shit
Selling twenty on my block, bitch, on a shit of asphalt
What do you want, what do you want black?
I can live...
To all my niggas who got coke in their bubble wrap
I can live...
I use all my girls who get naked
The boos go to the store with the doobie pins still on
All my girls with credit card scams
Two children, a job and no man.
All my girls get that wash set with their wellness check
Haha, all moms give me a kiss, okay
All my niggas rock their tight caps
Trying to get to this rap, I know what I mean
All my cats with open boxes, big cars and no license
I like that shit, I see them all
All my niggas who say pause after they say a fucking shit Hahahahaha, rocking and hey, shit Jigga, Roc-A-Fella forever
Uhh, major currencies, yeah, uh-huh
Memph Bleek nigga, uh-huh uh
Ah shit, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Big man! You want to earn a lot of money, huh?
Let's see how hard you are
Do you know something about cocaine? Tell me!
Are you kidding me or what man?
There is a group of Colombians arriving on Friday - new types
They said they had two keys for us, for the openers
Pure cocaine, do you tell them, capiche?
I want you to go out there
And if it's what they say it is, you buy it, bring it back
You can make you win five thousand
Meet them at the Bodegas, at noon on Friday
Then you get the purchase money
Oh and boy, if something happens to buy money
Hey, poor thing
JAY-Z is going to put your head in your ass faster than a rabbit fucks
Bounce ... bounce, bounce, Jay-Z huh?
Yes, yes, yes, Roc-A-Fella, everyone, ha ha
Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella you
High stakes, I have more at stake than Philly
Jumping on the Lex Luger, the tires smoke like Buddha
Chrome radiant socks
Through my peripheral I see you plotting
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is devilish, what's the meaning?
With the sound of my mechanized money (brrrr)
My cup overflows with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that did it, six digits and running
You all niggas don't want it
I have the flow of the godfather, Don Juan DeMarco
I swear to God, don't fuck it up
I'm pulling this time (yeah, yeah, what)
To give you a piece of my mind
(Cause you can't hit the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you will be a star
Last seen out of the state where I drop my slingshot
Jumping on the road changing lanes
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my family squeeze like The Firm
Why play with fire, do you burn?
We come together as a choir, to acquire what we want
We make earth like worms, we produce G like sperm
Until the legs spread like germs
But until then lately, am I the one who is crazy?
Because that's the way you make me feel
(Cause you can't hit the hustle)
The way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have time
To hit the hustle for real
Me, all of you niggas having lunch, hitting the clock
My role is to do a lot and relax eating
Nothing to stop, unstoppable
Outline on ice, I have to warm up your crew
I gotta let you know niggas like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Get away from the champagne, Crystals by the bottle
However, it is a pity what you are not: who?
Polished like a cat, fucked Jay-Z
My dad knew exactly what he did when he did me
I tried to get a walnut and he got a walnut and what
I have the US Open, Jigga advantage
Serve as Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son, you are too anxious
Aren't you having it? Well, me neither
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh?
All we blacks have is sports and entertainment, until even
I can't touch the way a nigger eats, fuck you even!
I'm pulling this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
But until then lately, am I the one who is crazy?
Because that's the way you make me feel
To hit the hustle for real
I stayed with everyone, this is Maria Davis, crazy Wednesdays, we are here tonight to have a good time
("Me! The show begins! The show begins!")
Wait a minute; I see my man there, Jay-Z
Jay-Z, Dame Dash, let me hear that little tape of yours, and it's fantastic
Why don't you come over here and kick a freestyle?
Drop that champagne and kick a freestyle for me tonight
Can i kick it (If you can!)
Can i kick it (If you can!)
Can i kick it (If you can!)
You all motherfuckers must have heard that Tribe Called Quest shit
Let's do it again!
Can i kick it (If you can!)
Can i kick it (If you can!)
Well i went ... check this out
Too Much West Coast Cock Licking
And too many niggas on a mission, doing your best Jay-Z portrayal
Too many rough motherfuckers, I have my suspicions
That you're just a fish in a shark pool, nigga, listen
Too many bitches want to be ladies, so if you're a ho
I'll call you ho, too many bitches are grim
Too many brothers who want to be lovers don't know what romance is
Too many bitches caught by too much sexual advance
No doubt; Jay-Z has too many answers
I've been on this block many times
For all my brothers, it is not too late to unite
Because too black and too much love, the same forever
So I change styles every two rhymes
There are 22 two for all of you motherfuckers, right?
Continuous? Check it out what?
Can i kick it (If you can!)
Can i kick it (If you can!)
Well I went ... I, I, I
Coppe to reach my quota, push rock, roll smooth like you
All the groove like heist, slide up
Too many niggas fags record my spending
Exercise your gay minds like Richard Simmons
If you could catch Jay well, late at night
I dive in, spit out faster than you've seen
Manage the pain, then the minister shouts your name
In your wake as I peek out, look in your coffin
Mine is thinking about longevity until I'm seventy
Living heavenly, fuck, crime after crime, what?
Nigga you broke, what the fuck are you going to tell me?
Jay-Z, Jay-Z, now you know this is a fantastic track (aight)
Now does this come on your new album, on the Roc-A-Fella records in '96?
But I know you innocent, and I'm behind you 100%. Crazy Wednesdays, Ruby King, DJ Ace, Dame Dash, Roc-A-Fella Records, we all stand behind you, you can come back anytime!
(Ha, thank you very much)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Ace, put that music down. I smell a little reefer, now you see? So our people have nothing, because we don't know how to go to places and act properly.
("Hey, shut your mouth!")
Wait a minute, wait a minute, who told me to shut up? Who told me to shut up? Get it out of here! I won't continue this show until you cast it! Get it out right now, then I'll continue my speech!
Thank you, he's out of here now, now as I was saying ... we have to build our own businesses, we have to have our own record companies like Roc-A-Fella Records, we have this, put our own money into our businesses .. .
I can't hit the hustle
OK
Hears
This song
It was out of the first album I made
He was also fortunate to be blessed by the presence of
Queen of, only man reigns
I mean R&B, I mean hip hop
Maria!
Let me come up to your side, girl
Are you ready?
I just had to try them
I'm making short-term goals when the weather folds
Just save the skins and put ice on the gold
Cold with enough bail money to free a big Willie
High stakes, I have more at stake than Philly
Spree shopping, police in threes
Jumping on the Lex Luger, the tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs for trash handle
You all can't fade, radiant chrome stocks
Through my peripheral I see you plotting
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
The player is devilish, what is the meaning?
I lean on any player who intervenes with the sound of my money machine
My cup overflows with hundreds
Six digits and running, you don't want it
I have the flow of the godfather, Don Juan DeMarco
I'm pulling this time
To give you a piece of my mind
(Cause you can't hit the hustle)
Who do you think you are
I'm in the south picking up the best game
Jumping on the highway changing four lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money is not a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my family squeeze like The Firm
Going down for life, it's true, you better learn
While I play with fire, you burn
We come together as a choir, to acquire what we want
We make earth like worms, we produce G like sperm
Until the legs spread like germs
What you don't know
Uh uh uh uh
Because you can't hit the hustle
But until then lately, am I the one who is crazy?
(Talk to Mary)
Because that's the way you make me feel
(They feel you, they feel you)
I'm just trying to live well
I have no time
To hit the hustle for real
Me, having lunch, hitting the clock
My role is to do a lot and relax eating
Drinking Remy on the rocks, my crew
Nothing to stop, unstoppable
Outline on ice, I have to warm up your crew
I have to warn you guys, the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Get away from the champagne, Crystals by the bottle
It's a pity what you are not (me)
Slick like a cat, ya boy Jay-Z
My dad knew exactly what he did when he did me
I tried to get a walnut and he got a walnut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
I have the US Open, Jigga advantage
Serve as Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
You do not have it
Oh well me neither
Let's unite and make this whole world believe us huh
In my charge reading screaming
Good
(Let me buy you one)
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
(That's right, Jay Z baby)
Baby one day you will be a star
(We go to the center)
Because that's the way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have time
To hit the hustle for real
(Let's go to town, let's take them to Yonkers)
Family affair [Mary J. Blige (Jay Z)]
People, can we do it tonight?
(We at Yonkers now)
Yes Yes Yes
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
Let's get it
(Talk to Mary)
Let's make it creak tonight
Let's do it, have fun
In this dance
We have you open, now you are floating
So you have to dance for me
(Talk to them)
I don't need hate, holleratin '
Let's do it while you wait
So dance for me
Dance for jay z
(Come on)
Let's go everyone
I have to thank Jigga for letting me down tonight
(No no thanks)
Thank you very much
Thank you
(Again for Mrs. Mary J Blige you
(Because you can't hit the hustle ...)
Foooooool's, paradise
You better think twice
(Roc-A-Fella, does not stop)
Because it's not very nice
We are about to change this beloved game
Check my pockets, there's nothing else I play there
I'm left unmatched, keep the lame clear
And cats that are scratched stay here
On top of this metropolis
He left each level
I heard it the other day
Through the letter, see how they write it
We have to listen to you every night before turning on the lights, he's an addictive guy
I need money to live, the rhythm continues
Every day is a hustle, the heat grows
The funny thing happens when years of chasing money develop
Blacks stay low like six fours of shit and gold
And watch the hoes in tight clothes
I can't hit the hustle
I'm pulling this time (uh huh, uh huh)
(Because you can't hit the hustle, how do we do it)
Who do you think you are?
Maybe someday you will be a star
In a man's world, I need a girl to touch something
Take an 80 out of her Anne Klein bag and pop something
When I get home then it's on
Girl just break your legs in the shape of grade A eggs
Moans, screams again and screams as we focus as a varsity team
So they can hear you from Hollis, Queens
Life with me consists of many things
Chicks in your ear, kicking dirt, cause you got hotter rings
But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness
Remind them strange chicks, stay out of my dizziness
Know you can't love it, travel to Los Angeles without luggage
First class if my butt crashed, champagne spilled on me
Steak still hot on me
(Cause you can't hit the hustle)
But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy (uh huh)
Because that's the way you make me feel (how, how do we do it)
The way you make me feel (cause you can't hit the hustle)
I don't want romance, I just want the chance
Since I retired, working alongside live cables
I guess I'm biased because what I'm talking about live
These types of rap in conflict
What part of the game is this?
It seems brainless, on tours like whores, guess what I say I miss
Cats fighting for their gold plates.
It started with four cats, it ended with gold Ac
I bet your lungs collapse if my bottoms get caught
On your way to me through you, fuck you
The gun exploded, one and then two shoes
I went through you like um, excuse me
But that's my cash, I have to understand your hustle
But that's my cash, don't you understand
Let my dough pass, you can show him love
But don't touch the hustle
I'm pulling this time
To give you a piece of my mind
(Cause you can't hit the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Maybe someday you will be a star (Jigga, Meli'sa)
(Cause you can't hit the hustle)
But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy (uh huh, ha ha)
Because that's the way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
(Cause you can't hit the hustle)
I don't want no romance (how we do it), I just want the chance (say what)
I can't really hit the hustle
(Cause you can't hit the hustle)
Remix (the hustle), '96
(You can't hit the hustle)
Don't stop at the top
Roc-A-Fella you
Irv Gotti, Jigga (can't touch the hustle)
Meli'sa Morgan, huh huh
Because you can't hit the hustle
(The hustle, can't hit the hustle
Cause I can't hit the hustle, the hustle
Because I can't touch the hustle)
Because you can't hit the hustle ...
Check my pockets it's just a game there
Keep the lame clean, and the junk cats stay here
On top of this metropolis
My name is like a square
He left each level
Now everyone can swear to Jay
I heard it the other day
Through the mystery, we get it quickly
We have to hit you every night before turning on the lights, it's kind of addictive
I need money to live, the rhythm continues
Every day is a hustle, the heat grows
Something curious happens, in the midst of chasing money and enemies.
And the worst thing about getting old is not getting old
Blacks stay low like six fours of shit and gold
And look at the hoes in tight clothes
And I hope they shine
Seen many things and enough memories to last me two lives
I can't hit the hustle
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
Baby one day you will be a star
watch this
In a man's world, a girl needs something hard
Take an 80 out of her Anne Klein bag and pop something
If you skate at night towards the light, then trust something
When I get home
Then it's on
Girl just breaks those legs in the shape of grade A eggs
Love the way you behave and beg
So they can hear you from Hollis, Queens (226)
Life with me consists of many things
The chicks in your ear hit the ground because you have hotter things
But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness
Remind crazy girls to stay out of my business
You know they can't love it, travel to Los Angeles without luggage
First class if my butt crashed, champagne spilled on me
Bank still out of me
But until the last day, I'm the one who's crazy.
Cause that's the way you make me feel (I can't hit the hustle)
I can't really hit the hustle
Since you retired, working alongside live cables
I guess I'm partial, what I'm talking about, I live
It seems brainless, on tours like whores, guess what I say I meant
Cats fighting for their gold plates.
I bet your lungs collapse if my bottoms get caught
The gun exploded, one and then two shoes
Run through you like UH, EXCUSE!
That's my cash don't you understand
Let my dough pass, you can show him love
Like a rap star in front of the club
But don't touch the hustle
I'm pulling this time (uh huh, uh huh)
To give you a piece of my mind
This is what we do at this time of year
Who do you think you are? (uh huh, uh huh)
Baby one day you will be a star
(Oh shit)
It started as a seed of semen; straight from dad's nuts
Curves make a black man cry, tits and shit
Put my name tattooed so that ass is mine
A local legend throughout the neighborhood, follow me
Got a gun on me, running for none on the run baby
You know a black man needs something, is my son crazy?
Why do i cry when i'm beating to death
Imagine a nigga in the sky, tall grass that fly
You got me missing dead friends who wish fake ones die
Hit the grass and wait for me to take you high; Dear God
Understand my ways, living important
Blessed with a thug heart ... and real live nigga nature
Yes you know i will die for you
And you know that I will go with you
I will always try with you
I will climb a high mountain aha
So baby come closer to me
This is where your love is supposed to be
I let you kiss me where it hurts
I met you at a pool party, it was great to kick him
Little ecstasy, Hennessy, mix with me
Aiming for the places you want me to hit
Give me space in the womb, call the police
Nigga, hitting the walls until bastards fall
Tag me Makaveli - black thug with bite
Living life like a rock star on Friday night
Earn money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone on the trip to complete my nature, sit me down!
But until then lately, am I the one who is crazy?
(Young is in the building)
To hit the hustle for real
My role is to do a lot and relax eating
Nothing to stop, unstoppable
Outline on ice, I have to warm up your crew
I have to let you know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Get away from the champagne, Crystals by the bottle
Polished like a cat, Jay-Z
I tried to get a walnut and he got a walnut and what
Straight bananas; can a beach see me
Serve as Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son, you are too anxious
You don't have it, well neither do I
In my charge reading screaming
Thief, as long as I breathe
I can't touch the way a beach eats, yeah
Ha ha ha ha ha yeah yeah
What is a player?
(Your player, it's about you
How are you going to say that man)
If I had your hand I would give mine
(As far as I'm concerned, if I had your hand, I'd cut mines)
You know money is slow money but it's money
(Look at this, man, you keep your bitches
This is what you tell them
They put their hands in their panties, they grab that knot
They put their arm in the window of a car, throw it like it's hot)
Like a hymen, when I rhyme with remarkable rhythm
Spitting poison into the minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think similar type thoughts
Can you remember my shit is cold like December?
Softer than Persian rugs, cashmere
Chromosomes make a nigga Jigga - Jay-Z, lethal drugs
18-karat gold ballpoint pen, when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like I'm hitting them with platinum teeth
Because all beef comes well done filet mignon
Yawn, (slow) when hoes tries to trick a professional
As if you didn't know, Jay tries to get dough
Spitting flows like fine wines down the earlobe
I'm soft but deadly like a pearl-handled pistol
The honeys buzz in the melody when I rub it like glass
The right label, when I drop the subject verb
Then the predicate, with this rich black rhetoric
I'm solid gold, I rap like a stolen mink
I stick pearl tongues that your world will never know
From New York to Paris, the vocal style varies
From nice to deadly like a bad D bag, now
Observe the speedy child like a lotus
Focus on the place 'I'm the best nigga who wrote it
Return of the Jedi, from Rio de Janeiro in the red eye
However, I still feel the need to fly.
I died when I was rapping and then I slip like satin
I never cry if I did, I would cry ice
From my nigga Willow, I hit you with this tip
Life is short so play hard and stay hard
And the only time you love them is when your dick is hard
Whoooh! (That's cashmere baby)
(Man, shit, J to A to Y to Z)
Cashmere baby
(Cool motherfucker that's what it will be)
Cashmere baby
Sho 'you're right, sho' you're right
(They niggas know)
Check it out, check it out
Errol Flynn from Ghetto, hot as heroin
Young pimps are sterile when I pass your city and
I have to keep your tricks intact
Cause I walk like a p-iy-imp, I speak like a mack, man
Sweet Mrs. Fine Thing puh-layah, you're right
I'm tight, so why should I change tonight?
Go tell your dog I'm lethal until he's not well
I do tricks with a trick: look
Damn, if your leg broke, bitch, jump on your good foot ...
Ready for that
I'm ready for that
Yes ahh
East side nigga with your feet up
Nigga with that Lisa, huh
Talking about that Lisa, nigga, with that Westside, nigga
With that east side, that dance, huh
Your eyes tell the truth when everything else lies
You can pretend we are related but the vibrations don't fly
Bruh, I survived reading guys like you
I'm surprised they think they can disguise all truths
I saw the eyes wide open when they were about to shoot
I salute these enemies, don't give me dap
All body language is all remedial
My intensive course was much harder
Then he hugs the mothers of his friends
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that were not there
But I could see a side eye in my dream
Eyes open them, mark the coins
Still itching for tears, they try to see you
Solipsist, admit it, see you there
So it seems, so you seem (Uh-huh, yes)
I can't tell if you're an image or just the flare (Yes)
I sat down with Prince, face to face
He told me his wishes before he died
Now Londell McMillan must be color blind.
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes completely closed to all lies
These niggas from the industry were always suspicious
But there's no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh?
This guy had "Slave" on his face
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk your house
I'm surprised you're not auctioning off the coffin
Not "big brother", not "Big Homie"
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I have been to Paris at least twice.
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen an eye
Eyes open them, mark the coins
I'm ready for earth, ready for the truth
Solipsist, admit it, see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're an image or just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams
I have been out of touch for a couple of years.
I've really been ready for this
Because I've been ready for you, really
Look, you've done enough
Don't you have a sense of decency, sir?
Finally, haven't you left any sense of decency?
Nigga with that Lisa, huh
Talking about that Lisa, nigga, with that Westside, nigga
With that side east, huh
What do you think you liked? You're not like my motherfucker
You're a punk, I've been with made-up people, connected people
Who you've been Cadena snatching with, jive-ass, fagot motherfuckers
Why don't you miss out?
Get out of here, go kick a freestyle or something.
Now you're tuned to the best
Motherfuckers can't beat us, join us, can't fade us, hate us
I can't touch it, fuck it, I can't see them, I try to be them
Both shows sold out your coliseum, 8th Wonder
Phase one of the acquisition, the break is over
Nigga, I'm the God MC, me, Jay-Hovah
Hitting the hearse where my doctors give
Hot land, FBI, DEA, I committed a crime, I escaped
They want to see me pay, motherfuckers better ride
If they try to plant, under the seat of my car
Even half a gram, better flaming them, in civilian clothes
Professional gaming representatives
We celebrate this, as you sit back screaming, you hate this
Try to violate this, get caught in my criminal matrix
Spitting Sperm Into Latex
You have no respect as a child rapist
Leave your melon spacious, professional delinquent, without pause
Neither Caesar's, the CIA flooded my block of diseases.
Informants heat up the place like a global warmin
Who starts * shit *? My style is mixed with arsenic
You call to order, I'll be in hell
Fair, they dominate the global, my life is a novel
Blazin in Barnes and Noble, idolize the voices
I'm Resident Evil, moving like (?)
Millionaire flowing like water, rap * niggas * running
I should applaud you, applaud
Point the MAC at you, * niggas * caught
Like a compound fracture, can't * fuck * widdit
For the love of sex, money and drugs
Affiliated with the sets, TEC, honies and thugs
Let the four powers rain down on niggas like a spring rain
And bring flowers to the bodies around us
If you were looking you found us
Moving with speed, I tried to play Superman
I ended up as Chris Reeves
Paraplegic and precise minds like the pharaohs of Egypt
Shot through a black barrel narrowly wove it
Keeping on top of my team with the Sweet 16's
Pulling out my jeans, in the ten-speed weeding
Wait, share these photos with you as a secret
It's like a story never told, but believe it ...
Street anthem anchor, quick to swap shots like a banker
Lick a round, niggas fall to the ground like Sanka
I've got your screw face forty-two ways
Aim better than toothpaste, Jerry Maguire
"Show me the money" as Clue tapes
Run in your place with some eights, zonin '
Four shots make you spin like chrome wheels
White sheets wrap you like a Roman
Back in New York, darling he wants it, he just spits blood and talks fun
Like dark rooms, fat bumps, pup with harpoon
Looking for heat, hunting on the grill, still ahead?
Keep squeezing, * fuck *, I leave the whole street
I'm afraid of falling like soap in prison
Just think of ours like they can't be touched, tasted, whatever
Never disrespect this thing of ours
Roc-A-Fella family
Wooo! Uh, uh, the rebound is back
Uhh, uh-uh uh uh, geyeah, your boy is back
You need to bounce for sexy, you know?
Ha ha ha, let's put it in
Yes ma, your friend is back, the Maybach Coupe is back
Tell everyone that the truth has returned
You don't have to argue about who can rap
Because the test is back, just check my raps
(New York, New York!) Yes, where are my soldiers?
I don't care what you do for the batteries
I know the world stuck your back to the wall
You have to fight, do that
I've been through it, I've been shot, shoot again
I have to keep the peace like a Buddhist
I am not a new Jack; no one is going to Wesley shoot me
It's less than likely, back off
Let me breathe, Jedi Knight
The more space I get, the better I write
Oh I never write, but if I ever write
(Change your clothes and go)
You know I stay cool until death, a project boy
And I'll take you to the top of the world, so let's go
(So let's swap numbers and let's go)
(And girl, I promise you, there are no substitutes) It's just me
And I'm not going to tell you again, let's get ghosts in the Ghost
You can bring your friend, we can make this a tandem
Or you can come alone if you can bear it
Better believe, I sweat fabrics
Give Afro Puffs as R.A.G.E
Aww you get if you could move it
Then run and tell the ducks you heard Hovi get some new shit
He is to the east coast what Snoop is
For the west coast, what face does Houston have?
Young Hov 'in the house is so necessary
No bra with that blouse, that's so necessary
No panties and jeans, that's so necessary
Now why are you facing me, is it necessary?

I bring more shine to The Source and Soul Trains
More chains than rings, niggas won't do a thing
I hit the four and four in broad daylight; i am upset
One shot Dillinger, one shot killing you
It's just a Roc La Familia
In fact, the east coast, did you take it from me?
Fourth album, still Jay, still spitting that real shit
Volume 3, still sold more records than Will Smith
I can't call this a comeback, I run rap, what the hell are they saying?
Five million? I did it and I came back
Former Sinner, Grammy Award Winner

Uhh, yeah, uh-uhh-uh
Uh-huh, uh-uh-uhh, uhh, uhh
I'm not trying to be rude friend
But give some nigga some room
I'm not trying to be rude friend
Just give a nigga some room
I'm just trying to talk darling
Why are you here looking at me?
While all these girls are here?
They don't want me to spray the semi here
I mean, if you're a fan, I consider you fam '
But shake hands with a nigga, well shit damn
All of that ("Do you remember me, dawg?") No, I'm drawing a blank space
You got me feeling like a fish, in a fish tank
Just think, if you came to a club
Trying to find a little hon for a one night love
'Please have another nigga in your cup
You make me an awkward bully, go that way!
Because I keep enough heat to melt that
I came with some sweats, I came to meet me
Trying to find a girl that makes it difficult for me "next!"
Treat me like a baby, mouth on your breasts
.. go get yourself one
Go dance, fuck you, damn it
.. go get yourself one
So many hoes here
There are so many hoes here
I'm not trying to be rude, why don't you go away?
There are so many hoes here
Yeah yeah yeah i know your rap and sister spit too
You have called the office and you cannot pass
I understand all that, but now is not the time
I came to the club to get that out of my mind
And all your thugs with your war stories start to bore me
I'm not trying to hear about your guts and your glory
I am trying to listen to B.I.G. and some cuts from N.O.R.E
And you keep talking about the beat like Clue ("Do you remember?")
You're a janitor, go get something to screw
Disappear like Copperfield, go feel
Play hide and seek for real, huh?
The girl came dressed only to get tangled
He combed his hair, just to make him sweat
Shit, I'm trying to help her
Why don't you help me and go out?
Quick question: why are you here?
So many hoes here
My office hours from 9 to 5, why don't you call me there?
There are so many hoes here
I'm not trying to be rude, why don't you go away?
There are so many hoes here
I understand you have problems but I really don't care
There are so many hoes here
Jeah, jeah, jeah
You are invading my space
You need to be easy, ahh
You are invading my space
You are invading my space
Come on dawg, be easy, ahh
Uh-uh, I don't know why they do that
Heh, I don't understand
Stop spitting in my face and go talk to them hoes here
Stop spitting in my face and go talk to them hoes here
Come on dawg, stop spitting in my face and go talk to them hoes here
It is easy
I remove your black roof, I let the sun shine
Thirty-eight waist, enough to put a nine on
Really thirty-six without the gun, I'm skinny
But when the gat is in, I'm fat as shit
Ignorant bastard, I'll take you back to day one
No kids, but trust me, I know how to lift a gun
For niggas who think I spend my days in the sun
Well, here is the surprise of your life, the Glock is not the microphone.
Homie, I don't like the hype; trust me i'm still street
You keep fucking around, then trust me, I keep crawling
Yeah i know the platinum chain will look really sweet
S dot Carter turns rappers into martyrs
Parents separated from their daughters, why bother?
I disobeyed the law, I threw the book away like you
How dare you look at Jigga like she's shaken like who?
I keep the fifth with me nigga, come find me ..
{* gong sounds *} Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-come ..
{* the bell rings *} COME AND GET ME! Ka-ka-ka ..
{* the bell rings *} .. Ka-ka-ka-ka-come
{* the bell rings *} .. come and bring me COME AND TAKE ME
I don't know what it's all black
Trying to do but I don't like it
Yeah, straight gangster shit
Heyyyy, gangster shit uh-huh-uh-uhh
Uhh, straight gangster nigga
Roc ..
Me, the summer is about to heat up
Niggas come back from jail and plot
The Continental T has them resenting me
God, I work hard, please don't envy me
I paid the cost of being the boss to use this hard dental floss
All you remember is the part of me parking hard
What about all those days that I was walking my dogs?
Barking at the girls, but they never screamed
And if they did all they said was, "Where are the dollars?"
Imagine being skinny growing around brolic cats
Until I have a gat and start coming back noisily
On the way back, niggas called me Bobby Boucher
Now all I hear are whispers of what you're going to do to Jay
Get your cat out, take the car, take my cruise
Got shots to hit, come on and get me nigga
Do you want to steal the child? Come and bring me nigga
No, part of this, come get me black
I worked hard for this, come get me nigga
I have shots to give, COME AND HAVE ME ...
I did it like that, you could say Marcy and everything was fine
I'm not crossed, I brought the suburbs to the neighborhood
I went to MTV with rags, I made them love you
You know those people wouldn't normally be fucking witches
Until I made them understand why you do what you do
But instead, all I hear is buzzing in your crew
How are you planning, trying to get used to my movements?
So they can record my mouth, reframe my house
But I'm proud, first I'm a nigga
I have to lift my cock and pull the trigger first
This is how Jigga works
The funny; I represent them all every time I spit a verse
And that's the shit that hurts
But hey, I got it right, I have my nine here
So when they feel the time is right ...
Do you want to steal the child? Come and bring me nigga
No, part of this, come get me black
I worked hard for this, come get me nigga
I have shots to give, COME AND HAVE ME ...
COME AND PICK ME UP...
Ayo me, ayo yo
It's only fair that I warn you, rap is my new hustle
I'm treating it like the corner, fuck me if you want
My game changes but my frame of mind remains the same
Shit, I started from nothing; zero zip
I made my way in a hurry, I don't owe blacks shit
I'm paranoid now so I keep the gun on
With the cats I played skelly with? Niggas done flipped
Two in hiding, one goes up when I change
I keep one under the chair where I sit
I even have a gun in my hair in my bitch's bun
Ask Biggs; every time i came to my crib
I'd find another weapon that I hid
I'm ready to make this the hottest summer there is
Every day like a hundred and six ... shit ...
Do you want to steal the child? Come and bring me nigga
No, part of this, come get me black
I worked hard for this, come get me nigga
COME AND PICK ME UP...
Got shots to hit, come on and get me nigga
Do you want to steal the child? Come and bring me nigga
I worked hard for this, come get me nigga
COME AND PICK ME UP...
Motherfuckers!
Yes...
Come experience ... life as we know it
As some of you should know
Actions: well you know the actions
Uhh, I have this shorty on my block always marking my rocks
For hawking honies, I'm the hottest nigga in New York and
I saw him do some extremes, to get his little shoes and equipment
So it's enough to go back up
For Guess to Versace, now they are diamonds like Liberace
That's just the natural cycle
No one wants to be like Michael where I'm from
Just those niggas that bounced off a gun
We are here trying to turn hard white to green cohhhhld
I can help explode like Afro-Sheen
Also, I can relive my youthful days that are gone
Little peeps of that little nigga, time to put it on
Time to climb (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
I have to block it and when they rush (defend my position)
Time to go upstairs (lift my chest and booty)
Gots to block it and when they rush (stand on my own two)
I'm out here pulling, bringing drama, trying to climb
I'm out here serving, disturbing the peace
Life could be better like my man reclining in luxurious leather seats
He is selling weight, I am selling eight ... balls
Sixteen, trying to graduate to push you fourth
I'm not going to sweat it, I'm going to let it come to me
If you give me the go-ahead then these niggas will see
I'm tired of being here all day and breaking the day
I stay cool so the chickens check
I'm trying to go to the next level
Pushing Vettes through objects
Diamonds are reflected from the sun
Directly in your balance
And son, I'm waiting for my day to come
I want to splurge
I don't want a life sentence, just give me the word
I have to block it and when they rush (defend my position)
Gots to block it and when they rush (stand on my own two)
Hi friend, I've been watching you dial
Who me Holding down this block? Is nothing
You black man now stop facing
Let's drive for a while! Cool black
Have it all, now listen to me
You let other niggas get the name, rise to fame
Ten thousand or one hundred G keep your shit the same
You let your shit bubble quietly (AND THEN YOU BLOW!)
Boy stay calm
The only way to spy on a fool is to let him show his hand
Don't blow your dough into hotties
The only thing I have in this world is my word and my nuts
And it won't break them for anyone
Ha, I like your resume, choose a day, you can start
From now until death do us part, nigga (Right!)
Time to climb (and hold my own weight, defend my crown)
I have to block it and when they rush (defend my position)
Gots to block it and when they rush (stand on my own two)
I have to block it and when they rush (defend my position)
Gots to block it and when they rush (stand on my own two)
Time to climb, hold my own weight, defend my crown
You have to block it and when they run - part two
Whiter cocaine now
The operation is sweet
Also, the price of a black has dropped
We blacks to see
Time to start popping up now
I don't know what's wrong with Bleek
It seems I'm like Keenan, picking up the mood
That he's not very happy, I could only see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the girls or how we split the loot
Time to visit her butt before she decides to get cute
He jumped like a star with the skinniest car
Because the last time they saw me getting out of the Coupé
I put on a suit
Look at this nigga Jay up front, trying to take my shine
I didn't say this verbally, I just had something in mind
Also, I'm huffing like an ounce more than I used to puff
Following the advice of these niggas but they're not used to it
They made me think: "Shit, I'm the one who moved things
As I drove around town in new Coupes and stuff. "
I swear to God, they had me practically hating their guts
When he got closer, I said, "Jigga, what's wrong?"
I'm done (uhh), I risked my life (uhh)
I soaked the game (yeah) now it's my time to shine
Ninety-eight, these streets are mine
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh-huh)
Look at that fake smile that you just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I show him or take out the tools and separate him?
I felt your hate was hard, before this fake shit starts
I should take him behind the building and set him on fire
Uh-oh, this nigga Jay, he's not slow, he must follow the mood
But if I hadn't been so high, I could have hidden
I tried to cover myself, while giving him a five
I hugged him as if I wanted to, at a glance
It would have seemed that we were the closest, but to those who know us
I could see that something was about to fall
Stay focused, I'm trying to focus
But it's like I'm reading my mind
As if he could see through this fog and all this grass in my mind
Could he see that he had plans, to be the man?
Since we first talked and he put that G in my hand
And I returned it to show him that he was depressed about the cause
When he got closer ("What's up, Bleek?") And I stopped
I'm done (uhh), I risked my life (uhh)
I soaked the game (yeah) now it's my time to shine
Ninety-eight, these streets are mine
I soaked the game (uhh), now it's your time to shine (yeah)
Time to switch, no more seconds in line
Ninety-eight, these streets are mine
Well we're wild in Vegas, designed to hate
In the mouth of the police, from the cranberry drops
Trimmed whips of the same color, we are stronger than brothers
With different fathers but the same mothers, this life doesn't love us
So until death do us part, I will never break my bond
Nigga, we Lex engines, V-12 pushers
While I'm standing
One leg of my pants, in a posture like, "So what?"
I know these niggas are feeding my cancer of mind
But in time is the answer (woo!)
It looks amazing, this herb and Hennessy
I have my mind on the move, trust me nigga I know
The girls used to ignore me
And my aunt says I need 50, not 60/40
Your weapon is my weapon, your clip is my clip, baby
Your fun is my fun (uh huh), your bitch is my bitch
I'm not just touching you, I'm killing your crew
Discs sold, black, perfect your role, geah
I'm done (uhh), I risked my life
I soaked the game (yeah) now it's my time to shine
Time to change (what?), No more seconds in line
Ninety-eight, these streets are mine (geah, geah)
I soaked the game (game above), now it's your time to shine
Ninety-eight, these streets are mine
I soaked the game, now is your time to shine
Time to switch, no more seconds in line
Yes Yes
Coming to two years old, new
* the Belly version has an extra verse
Yes check it out
I do smoke grass now I don't give a shit
And I also carry pistols in case my dram appears
It's crew love, I spit two for every thug
Fo pigeons blow dubs holding eight snub
I hold it under my strip, without going anywhere
Flip two eight balls fool the dough at low speed
Nigga don't prolong
Tap the studio and make it flow
And sell weight on a later basis
My older brother had pistols at his waist in case he ventilated the place
And walk straight at you, you fucking crooked niggas
I drink Henny mixed with nothing
My grass and the Dutch are something
It's Bleek, controlling these streets holding the heat
Ha ha, this is Roc-A-Fella for life
This is Roc-A-Fella for life.
You know it's crew love Roc-A-Fella until we die
As long as you and I keep it moving like a ride
We could stack dough up to the sky
Blacks can't touch what they can't feel, truly recognize
Crew love, Roc-A-Fella until we die
As long as you and I keep it moving like a ride
Blacks can't touch what they can't feel, truly recognize
Me, I set up a store with Nick Rocks that will annoy newbies
Make them slide like little cocks in the wet pussy
Open the entire strip, like Monopoly
Dare one of you to land on my property
Niggas can't pass anymore, see why it's hard to pass
Write ta land in jail can't pay your bail
I'm the wrong one to lie to you
Shit, I'm the man who supplies, who supplies, who supplies you
And you will talk a lot of money
I'm trying to get it down for that damn money on the boardwalk
Two bricks money new blue six money
Flow like the flu and spit sick money
Roc-A-Fella wool route by Peep hotty
All black mask with tools
Beanie Mack I'm moving
I had niggas running from school picking new routes
So I'll run and lick a shot, make them move south
Change your last name, get a new spouse
Scrambled a down payment for a new house
No matter where you go, Mack has come looking for you
I'm like a black shadow, I'm right behind you
I will blow your brain and give you no reminder
Me and my road dog
Spit raw rolled niggas can smoke on
Shit, I let them have them, fags, you don't know my state
Fucking with my math you make us wild
Five nine one six O, light brown
M-E-M-P-H-I-S Bleek left him
Your crew loves, Roc-A-Fella until we die
As long as you and I keep it moving, nigga
Aiyyo I ask God MC to bless me
Wit a flow of sick ass and mass of sick ass
Where it doesn't make sense that hundreds and pennies and
Thousands of ice dollars freeze my necklace
Get the login bonus, meet Mack to improve them
Nigga is crew love
Brooklyn, and we don't quit
It's like that, me, and we don't stop
I get deep and dark like ditches
But when I rap, I get out
Like death without fail
Never crossed the black cat
With riches, I'm leaving
Stevie, saying "no wonder you're superstitious"
Beef, I'm with it, simple
You can all get it ...
Not everyone will understand
Do not worry about this
You can collect the data
Until your mind doesn't matter
Bubble like foam
Hurry up as the starting hitter
Until it's funny, do you feel me?
Don't bother me boy, I rip it silly
I will let you up, of course
But if you don't fall alone
MC, I cut my knees like shorts
No known remedy
On "bent knee" to "the end of the road"
I lie down, forget about this record shit, with a sale
Hey, forgive me ..
Check it out:
The nerve of these herbs.
You will already know who deviates
From the sidewalk on the LEX
I'm splashing, splurging
Dashing, that's my word, you know?
Champagne glass crashes, can't ration
I had a fifty dollar while
You were still taking Skippy to school
Ran with one of those cats
That hides Tiffany for them jewelry
When Duke was jumping
Out of the taxis at Krush Groove
Four cars and four hundred thousand shots later
You know what I mean?
Trying not to curse, you know?
Trying not to curse in this piece ...
They can't keep a good man down
Keep the vibes and they held firm
They will never take my crown
To whom Jah bless, I say that no man curse
Things get better when they think it would be worse
Here come the officers asking for a search.
In the presence of a king
Scratch that, you in the presence of a God
Put in the belly of the beast
I ran away, a nigga never had a job
Scott Boras, you're more than baby
Robinson Cano, you come with me
These niggas like rotary phones
Blacks always try to take down a black
Pull me to my knees a million times
I sold a million records like a million times
These niggas shouldn't let me in
I dance very hard on ESPN
Watch my name appear on CNN
about 6 minutes, you will see it again
Look at me, these niggas tried to shit on me
I was left for dead, they tried to erase me from your history
I was left for dead, they tried to erase me from their history
If fear is your only god
Crown crown
Crown crown
Bulletproof glass, glass roof like the Pope
Bulletproof love, niggas dropped from the bud
Bitch asked if it was God, dammit, am I supposed to say? No?
You've already seen me turn a man into a G.O.A.T
You know what I could do with coca
Dropped it into the water, made it disappear
I made it reappear, I had that bitch on a rope
I make my ceiling ghost, the bottom grille, I make my tooth turn golden
All the shit I did, I wasn't supposed to live, Hallelujah Hov
It wasn't for the 'Caine I couldn't
It wasn't for the bread, he probably would be dead
Best friends become enemies, black knives are double-edged
I was left for dead, they tried to erase me from your history
I told all of you niggas that if it wasn't a skirt it would be a dress
Great poison and fuck the rot of the city
Everyone assuming they are trying to get rid of me.
You should know that I don't give a shit, I got a bad rebuttal
Taste me! Look where your luck is going, you know what?
I am what you don't have a second chance
Do you think you can take a risk?
I'm putting niggas ba'y brother
Do you think you can bear that?
Your train of thought is derailed like amtrak
Me, my crimes and a couple of pennies
Lots of rolexes, unlimited line of credit visas
The heat is for niggas who wanna touch but can't reach us
Leave him speechless when the lead hits his dome
Life is nothing more than beaches and homes.
It doesn't stop, I can't stop
They spend too much time gossiping and shitting
You know?
That's another thing
However, we will address that at a later date.
However, everything must be addressed
You know?
Nothing slips
Word
It's murder
Alive or dead
My skills are and will stay ahead of you
I don't know when to let loose and let young souls die
Seeing a black man upset me is nothing new, you understand?
But it is how I retaliate that defines who I am
Jay-Z, there's nothing alive or dead playing with me
I take meat to the grave, that's how my mom raised me
So heaven or hell, niggas better have some answers for me
Damn, you've been on my dick a long time
(It's murder)
Welcome to the dome of terror
You mistake prone sick niggas
Roc-A-Fella clique thick as herring bones
What are legends made of?
Like when the exact blow
My voice closed behind bars in a bid for this spectacular shit
Fake children fold and lie, why?
I saw half a million sales with a golden eye
Patrol the sky to see dollars
The more we get caught, shooting until we laugh
Dress up the fagot, let them know what else could have it
Automatic rhyme spot 4 shot towards your attic
Alive or dead
If you like jewelry
You fools are gonna fuck up and lose your life
And I just hurt your wife
Don't get it wrong because we're in the limelight
I still hold the Glock with the twist of my wrist like these
Gangsta shit no thanks shit
Niggas sells a million records plus banks to divide
Motherfucker Jay-Z, who do you think he is?
I heard her body was too hot to get close
Too late to hear it
Two slugs wait to free their spirit
The known truth: I had a bad habit of blowing loot
Two niggas on the roof exploding in the phone booth
Running to cover himself in white because the bullets hover
Drug them after the slug came in
I take a phrase in God we trust that it is essential
Live for the gun, die for the same shit you're looking for
Fly bitches with waves from DC to Cali
Collect and count my dough for the grand finale
Vines around the alley unknown figures said
Trigger Lead knew how much we needed dead niggas
Conjure all roads escape closer
Never train drove the car to the edge of the tar
Intending to heal, shooting motherfuckers at Allah
Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm looking for dead presidents to represent me (Whose ...)
Rock .. on, Roc-A-Fella you
While others spit that shit out of Wonderama
Me and my chipboard
He'll remain anonymous, caught up in the best shit
Live my dreams until my heart gives up
Involved with cream, you know exactly what this shit is about
Damn, you mean? Driving since I was a teenager, I cast
As the base of your favorite team, without a doubt
My life is not rosy but I keep going
My mind was fine until the dough hit her
And he told me that the Mo 'did it
And now he's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but no bitches
Look how I'm walking
Cause even the strongest niggas are NARC'in
Trying to reach an agreement, hoping they can be forgiven
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles
And my brain begets the most horrible evil
Funny facts, in the game so deep demons could catch a
I have the city drinking Crystals, the rate goes up again
My rise to wealth surprised bitches: think more
G.S. the shit, Dree-ess the shit
Watch me shine like a Breitling, fuck Breguets
All rhymes forget it like Alzheimer's
Little timers, I said it, I'm tackling all the drama
Tell me!
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm looking for dead presidents to represent me (Whose ...)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm looking for dead presidents to represent me (Whose ...)
"I want money like Cosby", who doesn't?
This is a kind of talk
That makes me think you probably have no pudding
Niggas got them like prison dreams
You on the streets, nigga, make your moves, receive your mail
Niggas will cost in the SL but can't pay the deposit
Niggas, it'll roast an L but, scared of tossing your toast, well
There's heaven, then there's hell, niggas
The next day you are sweating, forgetting your lies
Alibis don't match, nonsense catches up
Hit with the RICO, reposition your vehicle
Everything was fine just a week ago
Ready to start diving, right?
I will forgive your weak idiot: rush you, isn't it you?
Aside from fast cars, honies that shake their asses in bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With underworld distributors, MAC millers transporters
Bodiers from the east coast, peelers from the west coast
Little monkey niggas turn gorillas
Stopped at the station, full of octane
Killing day after day
When money plays, they play you
Trying to escape my own mind, stalking the enemy
Representing infinity with presidencies, you know?
Presidents dead to represent me (Whose ...)
Presidents dead to represent me (Whose ...)
Presidents dead to represent me (Whose ...)
Presidents dead to represent me (Whose ...)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)

I'm out for the presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm looking for dead presidents to represent me (whose ...)
Rock .. on, Roc-A-Fella you
The saga continues ... (what the fuck?)
Ahh, who wants to bet we don't touch lettuce?
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous, everyone else
You feel the vibe, all you niggas just rhyme
For ounces, the dough builds up like snow
We don't just shine, we light up the whole show, do you feel me?
Spill three-quarters of my blood on the street, let alone the heat
Fuck, they hate a nigga who loves his life
In every way possible, knowing that the feds are messing up my life
Hospital days reflecting when my man went to bed
In the high block of the upper part, the side was sprayed
I, still in everything we live, only dreams of the return
That made him smile, even though his eyes said "pray for me"
I'll make you a better one and I'll kill these niggas faithfully
And I have nothing but time
Three shots, at close range, never touched me, divine intervention
I can't help myself, from drinking Mai-Tai, with Ty-Ty
Down in Nevada ha ha ha poppa word life
I got into crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight
I'm out for the presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm out for the presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm looking for dead presidents to represent me (whose ...)
Geyeah, you know what?
I'll make you and your wack mans double up like bad hands
Roll as a monopoly, move forward
You're copulating me like white crystal
What I collect the most at the end of the fiscal year is what these niggas might want
The dead presidential candidate
With the splashes and the Presidential, ice that offends you
In due time when crime flees from my mind
As long as the villain wins
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas are biting
J-A-Y script, control, manipulation
I have a good life, man, pounds and pennies
Catch me swinging by the fence
Dead presidents, you know? Uh huh
Presidents dead to represent me (whose ...)
Presidents dead to represent me (whose ...)
I'm out for the presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm out for the presidents to represent me (get money!)
Ha ha, yes (ha ha) yes, so be it
The Soviet, the Unified Constant Flow
You know it: you're light, I'm heavy, you roll heavy dough
Your paper falls slow like confetti, mine is a constant growth, parakeet
My dough flips like Tae-Kwon
Jay-Z the icon, baby, do you like Dom?
Maybe these Crystals will change your life, huh? Roll with the winners.
Heavy spinners as successful records: Roc-A-Fella
Don't correct it, this shit is perfected
From fries to chicks to stripping a Lexus
We're cakin ', you niggas are faking, we're doing it
Criminal family, well connected, Jay-Z
And you fake thugs are offline like MTV
Empty three, I take your treasure, a pleasure
Presidents dead to represent me (whose ...)
Presidents dead to represent me (whose ...)
I'm out for the presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm out for the presidents to represent me (get money!)

Those who hate say hello, the enemies do not say anything
But booya click booya click, click
Ooh, you've already stumbled on a fortune
The hip hop revival since they had abortions
And I sway like the bush. Rushmore, take your thesaurus
Then you can find a synonym for a black man who has been a gem
Sheriffs want to see me handcuffed like button links
Reserve them! Fuck is upstairs?
Mind of a Vietnam vet when a rhyme nigga
A black glow, like I'm seeing signs in a different light
I'm in my routine, do you see it well? Really hungry artist
Finna blows like a Mario Game cartridge, standing on my two
Dave and I like Big and Puff before shiny costumes
A tiger in the center
Too hot to handle, too dumb to hold
2DopeBoyz we roll deep all get together

Spit, you crazy dog in this bitch, foaming at the mouth, are you a man or a mouse?
Drinking Mickey, while you look like Mickey catching him
That is not a mistake, it is really a drug line, and to see my vision, you
I would probably go blind
I'm chilling with a blonde, she's dumb, but she can suck a bowling ball
Through a straw, that makes you tell your mom
I'm just a little nigga trying to make my city proud, I used to see Doug and wear
My cousins give me away

Bitten gloves cause

We boys in the neighborhood
Pocket full of dubbing
Homies offline
Clip full of slugs
If you try to fuck, baby, do your thang
Shake, shake
Sick of watts you claim, come on and give up
Baby do your thang
You should already know what I came for
Watch my chain hang out
They gang hit
West coast my state, left coast my state, you state myspace, internet gangster
Blue Bell jeans with tapered neckline
No i can't save you
Name that captain
Speed up your engines, sound like a fart
I'm in the club sitting with some foreigners
She does not speak English words with sound delay
We're going hard on that apartment project
Five minutes in watts, let it begin
We boys in the neighborhood
Pocket full of dubbing
Homies offline
Clip full of slugs
Baby here's my number
Shake, shake
Sick of watts you claim, come on and give up
Baby I'm a gamer, go hit me
Baby do your thang
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Sit back, relax, I'm going to take you for a walk in the city of Watts, in the city of God
Where the bitches shaking that ass, deuce deuce in their bras
Where they niggas rock the flash, they drink hard liquor
Where they keep the Glock in their pants, the helicopter is right in the car
And if you intensify the day to day, you could leave with a scar
If your tight gang could go with a wide and like two of her friends they could enjoy a ménage
And that's the nightlife, in Watts California
The parties don't end until six in the morning
This Hennessey is straight, he has to get out of black
Take another drink and then I'm gone
If you're not hitting better keep your mouth
Don't claim anything you know you're not
Just stick with the script
We boys in the neighborhood
Homies offline
Clip full of slugs
If you try to fuck, baby, do your thang
Shake, shake
Sick of watts you claim, come on and give up
Baby do your thang
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Ahhh! Ahhh!
I remembered that you were in conflict
Misuse of your influence
The resentment that turned into a deep depression.
So I kept running
I was trying to convince myself of the stripes I received
(In the room, and I run it)
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
But while my loved ones were fighting the ongoing war in the city, I was entering a new
A war based on apartheid and discrimination.
Oh my nigga mom (R.I.P. Pat Dawg)
I'm gonna be the best one to do this shit
In my mom doe like
Aye Sounwave turns this shit black
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hates me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick is not free
Ghetto lullaby for every MC day
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
Nigga, now R.I.P
All my life I have to fight, nigga
All my life I ...
Difficult times like "God!"
Bad trips like "Yes!"
Nazareth, I'm screwed
Homie, you fucked up
But if God has us
Then we will be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Hey? We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Uh, and when I wake up
But the murder is looking at you face down
Schemin ', and let me tell you about my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where nice pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mom that I love her but this is what I like, God knows
20 of them in my Chevy, tell them to come get me
Picking up everything I sow, then my karma comes
And heaven has no preliminary hearing, so my record
I'm a damn gangster silent for the record
Tell the world that I know it's too late
Drowning in my vices all day
Couldn't you believe when I say
You wouldn't know
We've been hurt, we've been depressed before
Looking at the world like, "Where are we going?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Do you want to kill us dead on the street for you?
Nigga, I'm at the door of the preacher
My knees go weak and my gun could explode
But we will be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
What do you want, a house, a car?
40 acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Whatever, look, my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live in the mall
I can see evil, I can say it, I know it's illegal
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it in the Regal
Digging in my pocket, there's not a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your boy ... ah!
I don't talk about it, I know about it, every day I do sequels
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's it
Bick back and Chad, I catch the bag for all of you
I rap, I black on the track, so rest assured
You wouldn't know
We've been hurt, we've been depressed before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Do you want to kill us dead on the street for you?
Nigga, I'm at the door of the preacher
My knees go weak and my gun could explode
Nigga, we'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Hey? We'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
I keep my head up
I cross my heart and hope to die
Loving me is complicated
Too much fear, too many changes
I'm fine, and you're a favorite.
I remembered that you were in conflict
I misuse his influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my resentful power
The resentment that turned into a deep depression.
I didn't want to destroy myself
Lucy's ills were all around me.
You know I'm surgical with this bitch Jake
How do you want it dawg?
Closed coffin?
Remember that fool in a wheelchair?
How do you think it got there?
I have my air conditioning on now
Great about it
Oil talking please
Polished with it
Do you want to know what death feels like?
The scope I got for the long rifle fit quite well
Also, my connection has a pretty good price
I could take your neck off with just a slice
Of the blade
A cut can make you scream first aid
The birthday solution was to shoot directly
Stand on the block charging
Don't fuck with K-D-O-T
Oh i forgot
Never come around here without a Glock
Nigga I put heat on your boy
Leave him strapped in the back seat
With its engraved child duct it will not let out noise
Oh yes we have toys
Oh yes we have them choppas
In the kitchen (in the kitchen)
Betty Crocker (Betty Crocker)
I have kick (I have kick)
You hate (you hate)
You wait (you wait)
One second (one second)
I'll come back, then we'll go west
No vest, aim at your face
Unless you can stop them
I'm so thrown
Oh yes people there is a problem
I say
(You know what I'm talking?
I can feel that lane
Sometimes I lean back and let them look at me
I am so [?] Too
You see they'll love the conversation about oil
It is very skillful for them
I keep the air conditioning on
Great, great, great)
It runs when I flex the steel
Save in the ounce but don't know the price
But I know once ain't no bust late at night
I'm not fucking around with that, I'm going to let them plague the microphone
I keep a nine for you fools, then I divide your brain
I go to your safe, take your cash, cocaine
All your weed in your range because you go with platinum chains
Damn, pity, let's do shit niggas
Domino effect when we spray them with the semi
From the front to the back
Battery for battery
O gat by gat (braaap)
Niggas wise, better check my stacks
Stacked, lots of cheese
Cop the keys
The boss was given rocks to feed
List rates
Because there is no one to stop me
I have such a cold flow
So bold style
A nigga ran, I left his face passed out
And I don't feel bad, he got into the hole
West coast on the move
Promoting another episode
To the south, those niggas get [?] While we get [?]
This is what God feels, uh, yeah
Laughing at the bank like, "Aha!" Eh, yeah
Flex on swole like "A-ha!", Eh, he-yeah
You feel some kind of way, then a-ha!
Huh, he-yeah (A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha)
All I wanna be is a gunman (I was a gunman)
Shooting on the charts, you better run, man
Everyone has to see that I won, man
Polished like the DeBarge with finger waves, works, JT
Handle the bars like a fade, watch me work it out, JT
I'm free, running like a circuit, JT
I'm selling verses, JT, watch me work it out, JT
Do not judge me! My mom caught me on a leash
Do not judge me! I was young, fucking all the brats
Do not judge me! Aim your head for a pile
Do not judge me! If I press your line you're a weirdo
This is what God feels, uh, yeah
Laughing at the bank like, "Aha!" Eh, yeah
Flex on swole like "A-ha!", Eh, he-yeah
You feel some kind of way, then a-ha!
Damn, are you talking?
God throws full of carnivals
I kill them with kindness
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothing in life I can't handle
For the cause, I have put blood on the sword
All I do is hug them
All I write is a damn eight ball
All I touch is a damn gold mine
I don't rush shit, shit shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannon balls to ignite the shit, from morning to night shift
I'm on, I don't feel it
I want to see sometimes if you ignore it
Sometimes I'm on the street and I can't pay it
I have a bad habit, levitating, hating those who hate
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous.
This is how God feels
Huh, he does (that's how God feels)
(This is how God feels)
You feel some kind of way, then a-ha!
(This is how God feels)
Huh, he does (that's how God feels)
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
I still blame you, I still shame you
Feel that you are not shit, feel that you do not feel
Confidence in yourself, breaking on marble floors
Watching anonymous strangers, telling me I'm yours
But you are not shit, I am convinced that your tolerance is nothing special
Why can I blame you? Nigga, can I name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin '
A baby inside, just a teenager, where's your patience?
Where were your antennas?
I'm telling you, damn failure, you're not a leader!
I never liked you, I always despise you, I don't need you!
The world doesn't need you, don't let them fool you
The numbers also lie, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
I thought the money would change you
Made you more accommodating
I hate you, I hope you hug him
I swear-
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you, loving you, not loving you, 100th test
I can feel your vibe and recognize that you are ashamed of me
Yes i hate you too
(Hits)
Internal cleaning
Open the door! Open the door, I have to clean the room!
I don't have much time to clean the room!
Sorry!
You are the reason that mom and they are leaving
I know you are irresponsible, selfish, in denial, you can't help it
Your trials and tribulations are a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners screaming
Where was your support that you pretended?
You are not a brother, you are not a disciple
A friend never leaves Compton for profit
Or leave your best friend, little brother
You promised you would see him before he was shot
Along the way, bottles and bitches
You faced it once, that's not forgiven
Even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
I guess you thought she would recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't really stop the bleeding
Then he died, God Himself will say: "You have failed"
You don't try
Oh oh oh ohh ohh ohh
(Breathing)
What's up, nigga?
I thought you kept it gangsta
I thought this was what you wanted
But remember, he knows the Bible too
Now baby, when I understand you, I understand you, I understand you, I understand you
Smoking, watching, rummaging around until I'm idle with you
Because I love you)
Registration is out of order.
Smoking, drinking that potion, you can see me deviating
Because I love you)
(I love you more than you know)
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
'Until I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (love you)
You said that Sherane has nothing on Lucy
I said, "Are you crazy?"
But you and me pushing daisies if I (love you)
Now baby, when I understand you, I understand you, I understand you, I understand you
I'm going to hit the gas with you
Smoking, watching, rummaging around until I'm idle with you
You told me
You said your name was Lucy
I said to him: "Where's Ricardo?"
You said "Oh no it's not the show"
So you spit out some rap like that
When I turned twenty-six, I said, "Oh shit."
You told me
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick
You introduced me, Kendrick
But see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy has millions of stories
About these rappers that I looked for when they were boring
Lucy is going to fill your pockets
Lucy is going to get your mom out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion as promised
Avoiding me?
It's not that easy, I'm in these roles accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy doesn't loosen for a minute
Lucy works harder
Lucy will call you even when Lucy knows you love your father
I'm Lucy
I heard prayers on your first album, really
Lucy you don't care, because at the end of the day you will chase me
Lucy got paperwork in addition to paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy caught you
All your life I saw you
And now everyone grew up to sign this contract if that's possible. "
Now baby, when I understand you, I understand you, I understand you, I understand you
Smoking, watching, rummaging around until I'm idle with you
Registration is out of order.

From Lisa's to Keisha's to Nicole's
It bothered them, they sold me their soul
You all niggas should know by now, I got hoes boy
But you already know that, pimpin '
A slash baller killer as O.J. Simpson
Near the Microphone as Scottie Pippen
And I move with the coupe through the traffic
Real talk, boy, not just rap
With the tool, mommy knows that I practice
Because when I take it out, I'm shooting it back
I said "Don't worry, finish sucking me", oh fo 'sho'
Yes [?], They better act like they know what's going on
Before sending them to heaven let them know what's up
And I'm out of full speed because the flow has gas
Yeah our shit be the bomb
My suggestion, you get your pom poms and go for it
I'm going down like the youngest of the year

I am on my mission to conquer my competition
My ego is bigger than Jay-Z, sure, not a maybe

Mass hallucination, baby
Bad manners, baby
Do you want to reconnect with your emotions?
Look inside these walls and you'll see I'm having retreats
Of a prisoner on the way
Follow the dress just tell you I'm tired and I ran away
As the record spins I must pray
For the record, I recognize that I am easily prey
I ate alive yesterday
I have animosity building, it's probably as big as building
I'm jumping off the roof, I'm just playing it safe
But what should I do when the theme is red or blue?
And you understand that I am not
And live on the street with rank
There is no better picture to paint than me walking from the Bible study
And he called his friends because he said he noticed my face
From a show that took place, they were wondering if it hit
Step on my neck and put blood on your Nike checks
I don't care because one day you will respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city
Mass hallucination, baby
Bad manners, baby
Do you want to reconnect with your emotions?
This is your season, baby
Finding myself alone, promise me you can help
In all honesty, I had time to be copacetic until
It was like a head-on collision that left me still
Every time you look in the morning I feel like you just wanna kill
All my innocence while I ignore my purpose to persevere
As a better person; I know you heard this and probably scared
But what am I supposed to do when red and blue blink?
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say wow
And you ask: "Lift your shirt", because you wonder if a tattoo
Membership can make me a pleasure
Gang files, but that doesn't matter because the issue is racial profiling
Step on your neck as hard as your bulletproof vest
The good boy, m.A.A.d. city."
Mass hallucination, baby
Bad manners, baby
Do you want to reconnect with your emotions?
This is your season, baby
Everything I see in this room: 20's, Xannies and these 'mushrooms
Sweet adults for pain, can we live in a healthy mind?
Society? It's completely stressful for my brain
When violence is the beat, it inspired me to get
Silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms
The streets will surely cast the worst side of my best
Don't worry, because now you are indebted to a good boy, m.A.A.d. city
Mass hallucination, baby
Bad manners, baby
Do you want to reconnect with your emotions?
This is your season, baby
If Pirus and Crips got along
They would probably kill me at the end of this song
It seems that the whole city is against me
Every time I'm on the street I listen
"Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!"
"Fallen man
Where are you from, nigga?
"Damn, who do you know, where are you from, my nigger?"
"Where's your grandmother staying, eh, my nigger?"
Get ready, I'll take you on a journey down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm throwing crack or moving cocaine
This is a dead end and a lot of cognac and intense pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress on your brain
It was me, L Boog and Yan Yan, YG Lucky we traveled through Rosecrans
He got ugly, waving his hand out the window, check it out
I hope the euphoria can dance slowly with society
The driver's seat the first to be killed
In the same hamburger stand where you can hang out
Now this is not a recording that says he did
But since that day, I was looking at it differently
That was when I was nine years old
We adapt to crime, we pack a truck with four weapons at a time
Fuck you shooting because if you're not walking, damn punk?
Taking the fools off you, suck a dick or die or hit
A wall of bullets comes from
AK, AR, "Yes, everyone. Duck"
Aw man, damn it, all hell broke loose
Now drag your head on that rope
You end up dead in the news
There is no peace treaty, only piecin '
BG until pre-approved, bodies on top of bodies
IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
When you get on that car
Make sure your colors are correct
Make sure you are corporate, or they will call your mother to collect
They say the governor collects all our taxes except
City of M.A.A.d
"Fallen man
Where are you from, nigga?
"Damn, who do you know, where are you from, my nigger?"
"Where's your grandmother staying, eh, my nigger?"
"This city m.A.A.d that I run, my nigga"
If Pirus and Crips got along
They would probably kill me at the end of this song
Every time I'm on the street I listen
It's nothing more than a Compton thang
Chyea
Real plain and simple
"and I teach you some lessons on the street
It's nothing more than a Compton thang
Chyea
Fresh out of school because I was a high school graduate
Sleeping in the living room on my mom's pillow
Reality hit, I saw the white car crash
He hit the lamppost, two blacks jumped on foot and launched
My Pops said he needed a job that I thought I believed him.
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
To organize a robbery on the third Saturday, I entered
Projects broke down, gang cartels are dumped
Cocaine mixed with marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first forceful blow foamed you in the mouth
You know the reasons but you still won't know my life
Kendrick AKA Compton's human sacrifice
Cocaine, herb
Nigga has been mixing shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm poles, rear nudes, dipping
Make a black flip
Once it's crooked and shit
Block a nigga
I'm still in the neighborhood
The hood sank me so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the neighborhood where they beat
And niggas that rep colors are doing the same
Pass it to the left so you can smoke on me
A couple of IVs with the fucking spray can
Shooting in the crowd and then they all ran
Gunfire hits the enemy, the tough get brave
Fit regulators on the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we're still in the hood
So grab a leash because yeah it's so real
Deal with the result, a strap in hand
And a bird and ten big ones where the motherfuckers are
If I told you I killed a black man at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me as the innocent Kendrick you saw on the street
If I mentioned all my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say that my intelligence is now a great relief?
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor.
Instead of a boy with a helicopter holding the hostage from the dead end
Kill them all if they gossip, the Children of the Corn
Realizing the option of living a lie, they choke their bodies with toxins.
Drink and drive constantly, hit the dust and then look at this flame
Let it reach your eye, listen cowardly, the concept is aim and
They beat it up and slide that bitch with deposits
I live inside the womb of the rough
Good morning america (ahh)
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
Good morning america (ahh)
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
A new revelation
Good morning america (ahh)
Good morning america
The letter K, D-O-T, adds a space like a microsoft keyboard
Can't you see me, invisible balaclava
Take the eye out of my hat
Stool shit on niggas, nigga
My flow comes in the plural
I have the masses, that is, public companies
Low shorts, Los Angeles fashion still holds a grudge
Didn't forget they killed Pac niggas
Don't forget they left the west coast for dead
Instead, let's dust off the bullet out of our heads
Left a permanent scar, for everyone to recognize
California economy pay your taxes bitch
New chronicle, new [?] Spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, New 2Pac, New Doc Dre
A new west coast to wake up to, Nate
Good morning america
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new breeze coming in
I hope you are ready
A new revelation
Show you well
Young Kendrick The Adult Baby
Enough to recognize your shit, maybe I will spare your life, maybe not
Maybe I'll give you the funk
Geroge Clinic brings the phrase as if it obtained a specialization in English
This is a top academy, pay attention to the students
Niggas, you're a fool with a handgun, you might as well have a harpoon
I carry two or more with me like it's a shared car
Ee miles deep when it's beef I don't say get them I say move
Notice my professionalism, I'm honing my craft, you niggas are doing your job half-heartedly
Insubordination, I'm gonna make the boss fire you, oh I'm the boss, finish the bitch
It is a new day
New Chronicle
New snoop
New document
A new west coast
Don't wake up too late
Good morning america (aah)
A new elegant breeze. I hope you are ready.
Because as the golden daytons spin
Give birth to new life
A new revelation (the second coming is here)
Show you well
I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about Jay, Nas and him
Creme de la Creme Homie
Fat pockets bony hand
How is that
A little ironic the west coast, I uncheck it
Make it my priority in an orderly way that I'm not living
No one lasted on time, no one closed your blinds, the sun shines, bitch
It is a new day
New Chronicle
New snoop
New 2pac
New document
A new west coast
Don't wake up too late
Good morning america (aah)
As a new day begins, the saga continues
A new elegant breeze. I hope you are ready.
Because as the golden daytons spin
Give birth to new life
A new revelation (the second coming is here)
Show you well
My nigga hahahaha
Roll the window down start there
I see you have to listen to the street
You have to be huffing, you know
You gotta taste that shit, feel that
Learn that shit, brotha
Learn that shit, that shit will get you killed
Shit
24/7, 365, Kendrick Lamar is always on time
Oh, did you think you understood everything?
Take it from the horse's mouth, you'll never understand me
I told you plan B was to win your hearts before we win a Grammy
These days the shit hasn't changed, different toilet, the same shit
If it had been for my past time, I wouldn't be rapping
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When this is over, if you listen you will agree
I've felt this way since I was 16 years old, I got my senses back
Anyway, we never liked you, [hits] your friendship, I meant it
I am African American, I am African
I'm black as the moon, inherited from a small town
It came from the bottom of humanity
My hair is diaper, you know it's big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to end my culture
You know you're evil I want you to admit that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but you can't take my style away
And this is more than a confession.
I mean, I could press the button so you know my discretion
I'm saving my feelings, I know you feel it
You sabotage my community, killing and killing
You made me a murderer, the emancipation of a true higga
To give you what you need
It catches our bodies but it can't block our minds
Everyone just to
(The bigger I shoot)
I said they treat me like a slave, cah 'me black
Woi, we feel a lot of pain, cah 'we are black
And man, let's say they put me on a chain, cah 'we're black
Imagine now, a great golden chain full of rocks
How can you not see the whip, you left scars
They all say we are doomed from the start, because we are black
Remember this, every race starts from the block, just remember that
As we go
To give you what you need
Lock our body, can't catch our mind
We'll be fine
We'll be fine
We'll be fine
We are going to be a ...
Uh, and when I wake up
But the murder is looking at you face down
What Mac-11 even explodes on bass?
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty women and women, and it's the highlight
Now tell my mom that I love her but this is what I like, God knows
20 of them in my Chevy, tell them to come get me
Everything I know, karma comes heavy
There are no preliminary hearings on my record
Tell the world that I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I went crazy
Drowning in my vices all day
Couldn't you believe when I say
You wouldn't know
Looking at the world, "Where are we going?"
I'm at the door of the preacher
They want to kill us dead, at the door of the preacher
We said give them a little more
This time do it for you
But we will be fine
We will be fine (hello)
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We will be fine (P!)
We will be fine (hello)
We'll be fine
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
What do you want, a house, a car?
Acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Whatever, look, my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
You can live in the mall
I can see evil, I can smell it, I know it's illegal
Diggin 'in my pocket, sweet paint it on the Regal
Every day my logic gets another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your boy ... ah!
I don't talk about it, about it, every day I see
I don't talk about it, about it, every day I see
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's it
I rap, I'm black on the track, so rest assured
My rights, my mistakes; I write until I'm right with ...
It's been a week already
Feeling weak already
I put myself on top, possibility of what could be
The situation is heavy, I have to prove
On February 26, I also lost my life.
It's like I'm here in a dark dream
Nightmare, listen to recorded screams
Let's say it sounds distorted but you know who it was
That was my cry for help when he drowned in his blood
Why did he not defend himself? Why couldn't he throw a punch?
And for our community, do you know what it does?
Add to a trail of hate
Twenty twelve was recorded for the world to see
It will delay us another four hundred years
This is modern slavery
The reason why I'm in your house
You threw your briefcase on the couch
I plan to crawl through your damn door and fly
Every piece of your brain
Until your son jumps into your arms
I'm on the board with my bible in the trunk
I had the vodka on top
How could I make it popular?
Snort on what I want
How could I make it popular?
See I'm living with anxiety
Give up sobriety
Cursing with his sister
And playing with society
Justice is not free
Therefore, justice is not me
Try and justify staying, obituary
Why do you want to see a good man with a broken heart?
Now i'm thinking to myself
Hollow tips is all I have
Now i'm drinking alone
I caught you when you walk next to your house
You threw your briefcase on the couch
I plan to crawl through your damn door and fly
Every piece of your brain
The engine was sped up in a spectrum
I said Hiiipower, once you see it
Hiiipower, twice, you see it
Hiiipower, twice, you see it
Conversation for the entire nation, this is bigger than us
I don't need the hype
Call me, shit, I don't need an introduction
Without improvising my name 100 times for nothing
You know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
The analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm not like you new guys
Fighting for a few lines thinking you're hot
Because your homebody told you that you were several times
Which is too many times, they lie to you, they tell you a lie
Record 24 hours, niggas better raise your bars
My cool is on, she loves my air conditioner
My juice is on, and I wish one of you would try to steal from me
I shoot, and how do you lie between the sheets with the Isleys?
I push the coupe like at high speed
The helicopters come and realize that nothing is behind me.
Your honor, I fuck on this beat without a condom
This is not rap, it is really a rewind porn
Finally the best of all is back
You're just a little phrase from John
I'm Mike Jordan at his best
Today's Issac Hayes, Shaft theme song
Equivalent to the musical theme of your career, study my trade
You ignorant: I do it without a pen and a notebook
If my pockets is something you try to grab
You old news, old guys, get out of my way
Let the young man pass; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronauts niggas clutter up my space
You are not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But you're not really an exact bastard with this music business
The industry says "Fuck it, let the music be yours"
There's no theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Little shark, the jaws are here, jump into the water
Are you really fucking with President Carter?
My answer is that I can't get away from the bosses
Had the bidding war broken out as an auction?
Remember to have Aftermath sitting on my porch
Black diamonds, no rose gold
He partnered with the best of Watt
Jay Rock, aren't you going to avalanche these niggas so I can scale them?
(Jay Rock: give me a minute my nigga let me go find them)
Bring them to me, the 5'6 "rap thug is back for the first time, killing you niggas
But where Jigga left it, that's where I pick up
I have them holding my breath without hiccups
Real niggas: we're last, MY NIGGA
I raise the bar to rap in the West
Because you see boy of home, we are not receiving respect
So we have to get it back, return it to the Jheri curls
And the Raider caps, my khaki pants on
Address the problem in my last three songs
Man, Game knows about you west coast clones
And nigga, we hate twins
Put some change in it, see if it makes sense, you know
I have to be the new top 5 minus 4 race
That is number one, because the second is the first loser
Don't fight me homey, if you want your future
It doesn't promise rap, you might think it's hitting right
But look Onyx, they are not too tight
Interscope consults: see Suge Knight
I'm trying to get money like the Oasis
If you're not in the same shit as my gold D's, keep rolling
I keep rolling, I never stop
Top Dawg Entertainment: presents K-Dot
(Above Dawg, Money GANG)
Owwww, Dave, I see you, now look at me
Look, I'm saying I'm a millionaire
I'm a Top Dawg millia, no let me go unorthodox
I order a lot of ammunition for the enemies that I have
I'm the king, I'm just looking for my Coretta Scott
I bet I explode, like a boy band, I'm annoying to rappers
I guess I'm poison to rappers, in front of me, lean back
Treading on them like a Kappa
Cap and gown, graduated with my Masters
I swear there is none after
And you don't want to get caught up in the rapture
I'd probably burn your entire cologne
Chew you up and then spit you out
You're just a dick seed
Follow hood policies
Compton, California, where the fucking riders will be
You have never seen a murderer until you have seen one beside me
That green next to me
Fucking all about my fucking money like Assadomy
Fuck with the bitches right
I do
I do it, I make it run like I've grown my legs by hundreds
My pocket full of hundreds, I'm always hungry
Bummy, NEVER
In the middle of a conversation, cough a feather
And get ready for the detonation
I bombard anyone
Whatever you fight, I fight it twice like a woman who gives life to twins
I made my way through your fan base every time
Touching his demographics like Gregory Hines
I'm a beast, fuck a mansion, I'd rather live in a cave
Sasquatch is back, but what they really didn't know is that Sasquatch can rap
Motherfucker i'm iller
There's a boy named K Dot and he's a maniac!
I think his voice is sparse, with a tool actually
He spat like an Uzi, rat-tat-tat
He just shot me in the back, someone raises his back to me
I think that guy from Iraq, I think you all know better than
Head straight for the top like a baseball cap
Is there no one better than the one who can write like Langston Hughes from the brain?
I bet she goggle like an eyes diver in the sea
Recognize who I am, motherfucker K. Dot
Knitted motherfucker, hot motherfucker drop the top off when you showed up with the Glock
When i go pop pop
Everyone knows I'm where the money is, like where the money is, shit where the money is, I sleep where the money is
Rappers: I'm Iller
Where we go? Why are we slowing down?
(Smokes black, smokes black)
Where are we going we should be slowing down
Where are you going we should be growing up now
That's what he said to me, that place I used to call home
We don't even sleep, the neighbors can hear her cry
Meanwhile I'm on these streets with everyone I'm trying to make it
And she knows they caught me, I see her feelings, look at me
As they look with the saddest eyes of loneliness
They look at each other and they hardly blink
I tried to get it right, but the pen ran out of ink
Where are you going we should be growing up now
That's what he told me, but the place I call ambition
Like Dale Earnhardt, my liver is rotten, an alcoholic journey
Damn bad bitches and have bad intentions
Club night, boys and dolls.
Shooting but I'm about to drop the ball
I'm asking for help, my engineer called
He told me to go to the studio but I want to tell him, no
Where are you going we should be growing up now
That is what he said to me
But that place we call heaven unfair to me, only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something I don't know?
I know how to follow him more than follow people.
I guess I'm following evil, I should follow the cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don't need you
Where we go? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going we should be growing up now
So in conclusion
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So what is important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is
Would you recover or back down?
I try to visualize how to do it right, but my vision is very blurred
Try to slow down, stay close to the ground, but now we're always in a hurry
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
So we could be a little closer, I think we are getting closer
I think we are getting closer
How do I look, a fool for you, black?
Fuck you, newbie
Something amazing, heh heh heh
Hey hey hey hey
Light that shit, boy, hit that shit
Nigga, take a gun and drop that shit
Nigga, buy that neighborhood and fuck that bitch
And throw it out before the sun comes up
Nigga, my funds are up
Businesses move like the lights of New York City
Bitches for all that boy
Because they know that the young man has a cold prop
But I don't screw hood rats with them, they'll fool you
And I won't go out just like that
I'd rather go out for a shootout, plow
Every sun has a hood underneath
And you know that Marilyn Jones runs that shit
My bones made of cement, strong arm
It explodes in all of you, Vietnam, boom
Heh heh heh okay I'm ready ha ha
A thousand for the jeans, three hundred for the kicks, bitch
I was born with diamonds on my wrist
Directly unpleasant, don't pass me
I could grab it, I could take out a blade and stab it
I'd kill him only if you say
I am more than willing to take advantage
Legs to the ceiling, ho, throw your panties
I take them, then I do magic
Head on the highway, seat belt fastened
And go and tell the DJ to play my shit
You never heard anything like this, yuh
They say, "Who is that?" K. Point, no roof, new roof
They hate, they watch, they slow down
In a shootout with someone you got
.45, no lie, no problem
If you put your jewelry on, I'm a Black Rob.
Nigga, I'm a bad boy, I'm a black balaclava, boy
"Tell me where the safe is or this will be the last time
That you ever have a gun to your face "
It may be the last time someone runs in your place
I'm 2Pac, I'm hell, I'm so hot, I don't have chicken
Tell Colonel Sanders, do it for that Compton campus
Heh, I'm done with the fourth quarter
Shit, psychiatrist, Rock, bring 'em
New new spinners on the 'Lac
I never knew that Rock could do it like this
I'm a real mack, I hit more pussy than Vagisil, yeah
Who got this game on a choke?
Pack up and quit 'cause we're the shit
Also, that Calico has more shells than El Pollo Loco
Turn it into a mass of salt
Take your ho to mo-mo fast
She wants to jump up and down in my pogo
Me n 'Dot spat raw, deejays, Mr. Miyagi
You come to the front, they hit you like Onyx
Leave your block smoking like a luau
Dawg E-N-T top, bitch
We told you, heh-heh-heh, we told you, ah
Dawg top, nig, we told you, nigga done did it
That's where you went, boy, to the pine oil paradise. I'm going to get that gun, and then I'm going to get that money. I don't think you did, Jake. I'm going to get it right now (shot) Oh shit, awwwww, motherfucker! The next one will kill you. Ohh motherfucker. You shot me in the ass
I was never a bitch in my life, I never ran away from a fight
They told me that when niggas bark you should bite
And these puppies are not eating enough pedigree to scare something
Calf and stomach, you grab a woman's hand
I never got on the stand, I made fun of my man and came home like it was nothing, acting like I wasn't doing something wrong
Fuck it, and if I did I would look them in the face
Tell that jump to cover and spray
Tell them to make sure they hit my head and my waist
Tell them to circle the block twice in case they
Shit, cement bomb in my veins, body hard to death
Scream fucks the world with a capital F
And this is how we think
There's no tongue tissue niggas around me
Just a hundred cement blacks around me
We are hard bodied, all of you are not like ours
And if all of you were built for war
Tell them '
There are no teddy bears around me
Just a hundred cement blacks around me
We are hard bodied, all of you are not like ours
And it is transmitted as a ritual, not sworn
Walking down the block, K in my hands, fuck it, who wants it?
I have a hundred injections for any of you blood clots
Motherfucker, we will fuck you
I'm not a trick, we smell the shy
Either you fall now or you stop
Fifty-eight, fifty-nine, bloaw, you're too late
Motherfucker, know your destiny
Look between my eyes
And my four fifth burner, which is four five
What is that ninety-five Jordan shit
Jordans on your feet, let's take shit
Stand them up and reconfigure them shit
Now they don't look sweet?
You're talking from rear to back like crossed pockets
Mel Gibson, you're just acting
Lethal weapon, I take you niggas to shooting practice
Won't you listen when a grown man is lecturing you?
Because any weapon will do in the process of fucking you up, nigga
You rappers aren't built like us
Everyone lifts a lot of weights and looks tough
We see through that, we shoot through whatever is beneficial
And we are not thinking of handcuffs
The police running away from us, we are so tough, we trust
Tongue, ass, niggas, man, oh, let's wait, we say, or go hard or go home, that, that, that's what we go through, either for something or for something black, bite that, or- open your mouth, bite that forward you're suicidal
Yeah, oh fuck, I'm winning anyway, I'm winning, I'm beating any mother, I can't lose
When you see them what you say to them (Hello, enemy, Hello, enemy)
When you see them what you say to them (Hello, enemy, Hello, enemy)
When you see them what you say to them (Hello, enemy, Hello, enemy)
When you leave them what you say (Goodbye enemy, goodbye enemy)
Kkk dot bitch
Damn I'm a fly am I not a bitch
Don't tell me, don't smell me
Like you say i'm not shit
I am with those youngest
As if he were my partner
Welcome to our private matter
Where, the strait is here
Where the bitches are here
22 here you you
Won't you change your life?
Together we can slide
Midnight, Murcielago, strong pipes
Make sure that head is okay damn
I'll be in that other shit that makes them curse my government
Dayum, hate the game, hate me
And I love it
I'm bouncing around with a couple of models drinking that bubbly
I'm talking about yellow bottles with that bucket underneath
So they know you [?]
Damn I'm nice (I know)
And I see many enemies in this room
I just look at their faces, then I say what happens to them
Pull up on something new
Drinking that goose goose
I see some enemies in this room
So we tell them that I love you
Pull up on something new
Drinking that goose goose
We have some enemies in this room
You complete my life
I wonder where i would be
If it were not for you
Ugh, look at the denim bitch
That with the dictionary I can't even pronounce it
Don't worry about the name
Compton, California
Home of them p-public houses
Where the beast lives
And you can hear the growth of the city
Maserati hanging around
Hunching around the corner of your neighborhood
Every time a nigga shows up, they get mad and then they're a motherfucker
That's when I reached into my bag and threw more cash like a motherfucker
3 words to them at the club every time I hear them coming
Fuck those motherfuckers
Damn, I could put that in my life
I use your negative energy for my appetite (hunger)
100 horsepower in my car
They see me when I see them and then I say
What's up friend?
When you see them what you say to them (Hello, enemy, Hello, enemy)
When you see them what you say to them (Hello, enemy, Hello, enemy)
When you leave them what you say (Goodbye enemy, goodbye enemy)
Live from the 310 area code
Goodies backpack, black sweatshirt, [inaudible]
Completely separate bullets from their own egos, not see evil
Who is the hottest? I heat them up
Summer, wearing a jacket
I'm the baddest to put a letter on top of a device
Now ride, that's our flip, I'm a savage
Fabulous pun
Be very afraid, I am unpleasant with it
Born from the ass of a dragon, flamin ', shit to the masses
This harassment came from Kendrick, handing out coffins
Putting these rappers on it, you fit the image of a dead man
Hennessy and chronic in the same night, so what?
Red eyes like a fight at twelve o'clock
My nigga, how does it look?
Niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer without killing, there is no cure
Oil spill, turmoil, poverty, police brutality
Kicking the ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child abuse.
Cow intestines, Botox injections, government tested earthquakes
Secret society weapon, manifested opium plant
To stop us, great depression in Iraq, without direction, without Google map
Teens go crazy, moms cry boohoo
The governor keeps us hungry, these commercials keep us buying
These cigarette supermarkets fill our liver with triumph
Living with science, without a place to live, without Zion
Look, that's forbidden, we're frying
My nigga, how does it look?
This is exactly what hell looks like
Say it like I'm nigga, say it like I'm home boy
Tell it like it's nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!
Tell it like it's nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!
My nigga, how does it look?
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spitting
Kids playing, angels praying, 14-karat golden streets, kale
Red wine, sweet potato fries, turkey legs, calling every human being ...
Burning bullets allowing these walls to break
Devour these laws trying to empower me
I thought I knew the reason why you grew up to love sour diesel
Smoking like a locomotive, your focus was every hour
And then you caught me, your pity party had raised me
I doubt you hear, it's stuck on your system, I tried
Absorbing the reality of life, this is the visual
Baby Daddy a lightweight construction blade walking with a high heel
I paid stalking that avenue, I never knew how the light feels, I
I have a plan, I have a plan for you
I could only have a couple of bands for you
And leave this message in the sand for you
She said no, nigga, it's part of the game
Like heroin
The streets don't fail me now I need you just in time
Keep the rhythm and the ground needs you just in time
Say just in time
The streets don't fail me now I need you just in time
Say just in time
God please raise your smile, I need you just in time
Say just in time
Fugitive from fire, flight downhill
Put your head on this side now
You keep the pain inside now
What has been eating you, who has been needing you?
You've been keeping it low and
You've been taking me higher and higher
Chasing the baddest story, I mastered this gadget
Rackin 'my brain, I'm afraid of being average
Going against the current I just try to keep my wild
And foolish of me to let her do it, I love the calamity
I love a challenge, no, I love fantasy
Connect the black point, this is destiny
I'm talking about predestination
I'm talking blind dedication
Plan B is contraceptive, we didn't
Sexercise a little patience
The love of haste is us
I am addicted to violence, helicopters and sirens.
Blood pressure is flying, nigga, I'm trying
Heroin
The streets don't fail me now I need you just in time
Say just in time
Keep the rhythm and the ground needs you just in time
The streets don't fail me now I need you just in time
Say just in time
God please raise your smile, I need you just in time
Say just in time
And you could never get a penny baby (never get a penny)
It's hard to go home (hard to go home)
It's hard to go home (hard to go home baby)
She is my gift and my curse, she really quenches my thirst
She knows my thoughts, pleasures and pain.
Everyone loves her and she loves everyone equally
I could have a couple of bands for you
Leave a message in the sand for you
Nigga is like heroin
I don't know when I will return to Cali
I don't know when I'll be back too, okay?
Skkrt skkrt, pulling up, G5 lands in the valley
I don't know, I don't like them if they have some flaws
I don't know, I don't like them, this is a great bruhK-D-O-T, TDE
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Section 80, HiiiPoWeR
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone caught me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti clone
Back to stab your spine again
You slid your disk when I slipped my disk
You wanted to diss but you jumped on my cock
Unless you eat pussy that smells like stale plum
I have my finger on the damn gun
Aiming at a pig, Charlotte's network is going to miss you
My problem is not televised, and you don't have to tell the wise
How to keep up, because our life is instrumental
You'd die of diabetes if these other niggas wrote it down
And everything on television is just a product of the imagination.
While you wait I'm out of the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs
Just call the fuck HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, none other than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Visions of Martin Luther looking at me
If I see it as he saw it, that would make my parents happy
Sorry mom i can't turn the other cheek
They want to get me off the edge like a widow's beak, uhh
And she always told me to pray for the weak, uhh
The demons caught me, I haven't prayed in a few weeks, uhh
Dear Lord, come save me, the devil is working hard
Probably recording double shifts in all his jobs
Terrifying, so fucking terrifying
Enough to drive a man crazy, I need a license to kill
I'm standing in the field full of landmines
Doing the moonwalk, hoping to explode in time
Because 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Try to be a fucking legend, the man of humanity
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs
Nigga, none other than HiiiPoWeR
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Raise your hands by HiiiPoWeR
Every day we fight the system just to make our way
We've been depressed for a long time, but it's okay
We were built to be strong, because it's our life, na-na-na
Every day we fight against the system, we fight against the system
We fight the system (I never like the system)
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, we were running with Marcus Garvey
On the highway to Africa until I wreck my Audi
And I want everyone to see my autopsy
Without conspiracy, my destiny is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Enough to drive a man crazy, a woman crazy
The reason why Lauryn Hill does not sing, or Kurt Cobain
He uploaded that clip and then said: The drama it brings is crazy!
Product of the late 80s
Take out your weapons and play with me, let's light it
Because a riot, throw a Molotov, someone told me that the pirates were lost
Because we've been off slave ships
We have our own pyramids, we write our own hieroglyphs
Just call the fuck HiiiPoWeR
Yes, none other than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean the shit is Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPoWeR
Raise your hands by HiiiPoWeR
Thug Life! Thug Life!
H.O.C., H.O.C
All real smokers understand me H.O.C
H.O.C., H.O.C
All real smokers understand me H.O.C
Everyone knows I spit that other shit
Shit that makes you jump out of your seat and slap your mother
Especially when Drop loose the rhythm
Jump into the cabin and destroy every rapper's dream
They jump into a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and knit
Like Pam when Martin pulled pranks from his sleeve
Cause I'm the only nigga who doesn't smoke weed
Are you telling me that kush makes you think of level four?
I'm in five, you say I can level up more?
In high school my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Creation of man and Columbine.
You probably think I'm out of kush or hydro
I really appreciate you sharing your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the furthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
Just because they heard that new Wiz Khalifa tape
Knowing full well that they can't hit the sour
They're new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill spills over your city for 40 days
40 nights, off the chain, like the freedom of slaves
Before you twist it like 40 gays
My flow is worth the earth, that should not be evaluated
You know the kind of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session to disk when session ends
So my mom can have it and play it for her friends
Boast about me, like "My son is about to win
Somehow, someday, and I don't care when "
I could hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale, like an atheist
I bet you think this sucks I wrote
You probably think I'm out of kush or hydro
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate you sharing your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the furthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I'll take you back to the ninth grade
When Dough Boy kept me high for 4 days
That's my nigga he's a stray nigga
But still I think it was something purple
I didn't hear, I was floating like the Rose Parade
I swear to God a nigga has seen some flying fish
That was the trip to Las Vegas, sponsored by Hooters
At the same time I start writing like a damn monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this motherfucker reflects
Just underline each letter, uppercase K-D-O-T
Leaving it flat like a tire with slow leaks
Now what are you on? Nothing huh
Am I a square because I don't inflate a square?
Are my punches too blunt to hit? Yes
You probably think I'm out of kush or hydro
(No) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate you sharing your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the furthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
H.O.C., H.O.C
All real smokers give me H.O.C
(Bitch, I'm impressed!)
Misuse of your influence
Sometimes i did the same
The resentment that turned into a deep depression.
I found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't want to destroy myself
Lucy's ills were all around me.
So I went to look for answers
Until I got home
But that didn't stop the survivor's guilt
Coming and going trying to convince myself of the stripes I won
But as my loved ones fought the ongoing war in the city, I entered a new
It made me want to go back to town and tell friends what I learned.
The word was respect
Just because you were wearing a different gang color than mine
Forgetting all the pain and pain that we cause ourselves in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and prevent the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm not a mortal man, maybe I'm just another black
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess congratulating me on my diaper hair
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, I'll eat my asparagus.
So I ask him what he thinks of a young black man
Quick money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
I know you're dying to meet him, I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million
Hol 'up (Hol' up), hol 'up (Hol' up)
Hol 'up (Hol' up), hol 'up (Hol' up)
Yes, great shit broke out - Section.80
With my back against the wall
And your bitch on the edge of my cock, jump!
The brand of the tire gave you evidence that I am selling easily
With lightning speed
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wisest man
Truthfully, I'm eighty-seven
From a distance I don't know which one is Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? there is nobody, not even me
A Gemini screaming for help, someone
Hol 'up (Hol' up), hol 'up (Hol' up)
Hol 'up (Hol' up), hol 'up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit exploding, everyone watching
When you do it like that, nigga, losing is not an option
Hol 'up (Hol' up), hol 'up (Hol' up)
Hol 'up (Hol' up), hol 'up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit exploding -
Hey, hey, get her out of the study, Ali
24/7, nigga working her butt for that, she blows that ass for
They check my passport, I'm too used to customs
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why are you complaining
When you push a RAV4, you destroy my Jaguar
Hol 'up (Hol' up), hol 'up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit exploding, everyone watching
When you do it like that, nigga, losing is not an option
Hol 'up (Hol' up), hol 'up (Hol' up)
Hol 'up (Hol' up), hol 'up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit exploding, everyone watching
When you do it like that, nigga
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess congratulating me on my diaper hair
If I can fuck her in front of all these passengers
The plane's emergency landed, it was an honor
Hol 'up
Bu parçayı yerden 30 bin pies yüksekte yazdım
Hostes sert saçım üzerinden bana iltifatta bulunuyor
Eğer onu bütün bu yolcular karşısında becerebilseydim
Beni muhtemelen bir terörist sanarlardı
Kuşkonmazımı yiyin, sonra hostese genç bir zencinin düşüncelerini soruyorum
Hızlı gelen to see özgürlük
Muhtemelen bir dakika içinde öleceğim
Beni satisfies 20 sürtük, 20 milyon ve üzerinde Compton yazan bir şapka ile gömün

Evet, büyük şeyler oluyor
Section 80
Bu sürtüğe geri döndüm, sürtüğün arkasında, arkam duvara dayalıyken ve senin kaltağın sikimin sınırlarında, kalk üstünden
Bir sürtüğe sürtük, bir kaltağa kaltak ve bir bayana bayan derim
Asfaltın üzerindeyken yeri kırmak dışında bir şey yapmadım
Lastik izleri sana bir şimşek hızı ile satış yaptığımın kanıtlarını verir
Bir çocuk olarak iki yetişkin öldürdüm, ben çok gelişmişim
20 li yaşlarımı 2 yaşımdayken yaşadım, akıllı adam
Gerçeği söylemek gerekirse 87 yaşında gibiyim
80 din adamı kadar kötüyüm
Alev dolu bir havuzda şeytanın elini tutuyorum
Bir mesafeden bakınca hangisinin Hristiyan olduğunu ayırt edemiyorum, kahretsin
2012'de kime güvenebilirim ki?
Kimseye, kendime bile güvenemem
İkizler yardım çığlığı atıyor

Hostes polisi çağırıyor

K-dot, pick up the phone, nigga
Don't tell me they put you in some weird rap shit, nigga?
No tight socks and jeans and shit, ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha
Call me on Shaniqua's phone!
Your house boy, your block where you are from, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We were in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to do with dead homies
In the dead homies
I don't give a shit about politics in rap, my nigga
My little friend Stunna Deuce will never come back, my nigga
So you better try every time you jump with wax, my nigga
Fuck what they're talking about, your shit is where it is, my nigga
Now you fold, it's time to bubble the bread and curl up
Sticking to the scripts, now here if they Benjamins are going to snuggle
Jump, jump, drip, fall, flip, drop with the white sock
It says "Sherm Sticks, burn this"
This is how the product smells when chemicals are mixed
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressing rooms
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck you
I've been A-1 from day one, you niggas boo boo
Your house boy, your block where you are from, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We were in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
In the dead homies
Jump out of the Caddy, I just sucked my dick
Little friends called and said, "The enemies ended up piled up"
Oh yeah? Puto wants to fight my neighborhood?
Oh yeah? Tell them they can run for cardio
Oh yeah? Everything is everything, it is scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project full of cameras.
LAPD gamblin ', scramblin', slandering football numbers
Niggas names on paper, you teased all summer
The streets don't fail me now, they tell me it's a new gang in the city
From Compton to Congress, set up a journey everywhere
They give us weapons and drugs, they call us thugs
Make them promise to fuck with you
Without a condom, they fuck you, Obama says: "What does he do?"
Obama says, "What does he do?"
Obama says, "What does he do?"
Obama says, "What does he do?"
I've been A-1 from day one, you niggas boo boo
Lil hoes you went to school with, boo boo
Baby mama and your new bitch, boo boo
We were in the hood, 14 with the deuce-deuce
14 years later going hard, like we used to do with dead homies
In the dead homies
Everyone wants to talk about who is and who that
Who is the most real and who is crazy, or who is white or who is black?
Motherfucker, if you did, then the killer Mike would be platinum
All priorities screwed up, put energy on the wrong shit
Don't ask about the camera lock on award shows
No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my Vogues
'You least ask me about power, yes, I have a lot of that.
I had the coast waiting
I box them all, for a landslide
Nah, friend, we are too sensitive, it spills through the streets
I make the call and involve the coast, then history repeats itself
But I figured out inside that private room as I sat with Jay
He said "it's funny how a verse could ruin the game"
I remember you were in conflict
Misuse of your influence
Sometimes i did the same
I found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn't want to destroy myself
Lucy's ills were all around me.
So I went to look for answers
Until I got home
Going and coming
Trying to convince myself of the stripes I won
Or maybe because A-1 was my foundation
Back in town
Uh, now tell me who he is
K-Dot, young boy running the music business
You tell me it's worse
Will I be the best rapper or the rappers dying of thirst?
I'm like a gunman with these words
And you know that I'm packing
And that word is for Janet Jackson
I'm a black hippy, that's what I know
I carry a black heart, I love peace, that's my clothes
And then, and I don't know this name
(Steve Buscemi, he is the actor, man)
Thanks for that improvisation, G
The next thing you know, I Google it, it could be me
I hope it's rich, I hope it's against
Band in my pocket, no, I have no sponsors
I don't want the police to come to this place
Because I could run and run this race
That's in the rap game
You have a few more words, I become absurd
I have nouns, I have more verbs, this is the curb
I sway, my nigs, I flip the flows
I come from the west, I do my best
I'm not stressed, there's no competition
Does any rapper want to come see Rickey Smiley?
And hit them in the ass and take them in cash
And then we stab, out in that Jaguar
I give them, they see me, I blush
I'm talking about Halle Berry, Stacey Dash
But she votes for Mitt Romney
No i don't want that ass
I'm talking about Obama, I'm talking about more drama
Nah, that's Ebony Steele, that's me, really
That means she has confidence, that means she is beautiful
That means there is no dirt on the cuticles
That means she got that watch
Shirley Caesar, left seat, male
After forty years, they will take her around town.
That's Compton, everyone wants none
I have people in the back directly cheering
K-Dot Kendrick Lamar got mad
I have my hood on for Trayvon Martin
Freedom, justice, you know we are going to start
The party starts every time we go flippin '
Flamin 'hot cheetos i'm eating
I'm jumping in Los Angeles, that's something we do
Every day hanging out with my crew
Throw another word, watch me watch the train
Matter of face, where's my girl, Sherane?
And when I say "train", that doesn't mean I flip it
Yes, we throw, we turn like Flipper
My favorite cartoon, you know
I have to go with Bugs Bunny Cartoon Show
Give me nouns and verbs, what I spit is absurd
The finals, the Heat, yes, they came with the Heat
Another word, friend, give me what you have
Who kills my vibe? The haters, the groupies
Hoovers on the streets, try to shoot me
I move with heat, you can never stop me
The best strip club, it's in Atlanta, it's in Miami
I'm left with the (?), I say, "What's wrong, Shawty?"
You got your girl, I don't like the fake ass, I need a reference
I see everyone twerkin '
Even Miley Cyrus got that motherfucker to work
You can never stop me, The Rickey Smiley Show
I'm here, I'm here, I'm letting people know
The best famous woman in the game.
I like Rihanna, who else could complain?
I love, I can't even say the word
But I'm cursing and I don't need to pronounce a verb
The Black Hippy is the crew, we do what we do
We stay in the cabin, we do it, we shoot
We're headed straight for the stars, you know who we are
We ride Buicks, then we push the flashy cars
I'm a stream all day, this The Rickey Smiley Show
Just to let you know, we're still about to go
Bring me show love with the crew
Rickey Smiley Show, do you know what he does? What happens?
Yes
Now you're rocking with the best
The Hub City threat
Minor of the year.
K. Dot
Ooh, it's about to get so ugly here
It's about to get so ugly
Like who hears this
Oh man i laughed
Yes
Oh my god man oh my god
We're about to shit on these fags, man
Check it
Yes K. Dot
* Let me understand that *
First niggas used to rapping, get my attention
Now i don't even hear
Runs through one ear and out the other
And I don't buy niggas records for music
I'm more interested in their album covers.
I am a talented brotha
Also, I move so fast it's like my brain came with a joystick
Motherfuckers better listen when I spit
I play records outside the park
Homeboy I Ken Griffey a hitch, and could Ken Griffey already bitch
But he won't buy his shit, not even a little bag of chips
Just give him his long pipe until he scrapes his hips
Like a waitress, the way the broad asks for the tip
If you want, just ask for a clip
I'll give you those for free
I will not charge a fee
Just roll you up like cut sleeves
No one can cut the ...
Blowing through the Nintendo cartridges
For Maybachin, valet parkin '
Now people arguing
Who is better? They or him
He referring to me
They refer to the industry.
Surely Jay is gone, now give me the crown
Fuck later, I'm taking it now
Fuck enemies, I'm taking them down
With red ray, red ray, silencer, don't shout it, muffle the sound
Bark like ten rottweilers straight from the pound
Straight to the dollas, 745 [?] Impala, scraping the ground
I suggest you continue or not be smarter
Seeing another broken tomorrow
You can tell that the way I speak starts to stutter
First it was difficult for you to even make it more difficult
It's not about money, so don't bother
You all funny niggas, talking about shit running
When I'm looking at you like "Who are you?"
You all niggas is gas
And what makes that bad is that all of you niggas are trash
You don't want to see me spaz
Get out the doors
And watch me explode, ay
You better get a pen and a notebook
What to copy the last rhymes I had
And spit it out at your friends until everyone says "Did you write that?"
It doesn't matter because in a minute, I'll be loading my raps
A G for a bar, that's 3 16's, plus an 8-bar hook nigga, add that
I charge you a verse as Dre would charge you a clue
Your whole budget, hoes love it
Nigga, face it, you can't walk in my shoes or change sides trying to replace it
As for rap, I spit on Matrix
Past reality, nigga actually, I wrote a rhyme where there was no gravity
That's all another planet
For the real holmes, I do harm
Exploit your city, even your school campus
Let it explode
A gun subtracting your life, now that's the math basics
Oh my gosh let me stop talking about these niggas, b
They have to call 911, I'm done
Dave, do you feel me man? It is real
K. Dot man, I'm just having a little fun, man
It is really ugly, you know?
Yeah bang bang come on
Hesitation (to put pants on)
Come closer baby (so I can touch)
One question, am I moving too fast?
Cause I'm not leaving alone, I feel like I could be honest, baby
We both know that we are adults
Why i want to know
Yes you look good and i have money
But I don't want to waste my time
Behind my mind I hope you say two or three
But I don't want to waste my time
Temptation (it's calling your name)
Sweet persuasion, oh (baby, this is a game)
Come closer baby (if you like what you hear)
'Cause I'm not leaving alone, I feel like I could be honest, baby
We both know that we are adults
Why i want to know
How many drinks would it take you to go with me?
Yes you look good and i have money
Behind my mind I hope you say two or three
But I don't want to waste my time
Uh-huh and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow taxi
You're likely to catch, but your last ex made you mad
So I thought the perfect catch would be you if you made the pass
Pool full of liquor and then we dive
Knowing that if I lick it, I could die in it
Then reincarnate as a fly gymnast
Just to turn my tongue on you
Say your name, live in the moment
She tells me she never lets herself out the first time
And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pick up those bit tracks, that pack comes behind
Pool full of liquor and then we die in it
Or waste our time, baby, it's alright
Oh ok now
I don't want to waste my time, no
I don't want to waste your time darling
I don't want to waste our time, oh my time, oh whoa, now
How many drinks would it take you to go with me? (Oh yeah)
Yes you look good and i have money
But I don't want to waste my time (come with me baby)
Behind my mind I hope you say two or three
You look good we came to the party
But I don't want to waste my time, waste my time
No no no, I'm not judging if you decide you could be ___ tonight
Than? More power to you if you decide you could be ___ tonight
I'm not judging if you decide you could be ___ tonight
How much does a dollar really cost?
The question is damaging, paralyzing my thoughts
I have to see how I relax once I park this luxury car
Jumping feeling big like Mutombo
Now I can lend you an ear or two
How to stack this waste ten times
The liberal concept of what men will do
"20 in 6", he didn't hear me
African Indians only spoke Zulu
My American language was suspicious
I left the service station
He asked me for ten rand, stressed out by the dry land
Deep waters, blue skies that open
He begged and begged
Contributing money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said, "My son, temptation is one thing that I have defeated
Listen to me, I want a single invoice from you
Nothing less, nothing more "
Tell me; How much does a dollar cost?
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, whom you love
Everything you need, the air you breathe
Is looking at me incredulously
My temperament is growing, it's looking at me, I take my key
He's looking at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And something told me to keep it in the park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger.
How was I supposed to save him
As if I was the reason he is homeless and asks me for a favor
He is looking at me, I notice that his gaze is contagious
Because now I'm looking at him, feeling some kind of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, I'd be aiming at his neck
And this particular person just understood
"Have you ever opened Exodus 14?
A humble man is all we need "
It's more to feed your mind
Water, sun and love, whom you love
Everything you need, the air you breathe
Guilt stumbles and resentment
I never knew a transient that demanded attention
They made me feel frustrated, indecisive and empowered
Sour emotions made me look at the universe differently
I should distance myself, I should keep it unforgiving
My selfishness is what brought me here, who the hell am I kidding?
Crumbs and pennies, I need all the mines
And I recognize this kind of panhandlin 'all the time
I have better judgment, I know when nigga is in a rush, be aware
When I was fighting, I got engaged, now I understand
I smell grandpa's old medicine, coating my skin
Moonlight and gin, black you're babbling, your words are not flattering
The template is up, I saw you from a mile away losing focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said "Your potential is bittersweet"
I looked at it and said, "Every penny is a mine to keep."
He looked at me and said, "Know the truth, it will set you free
You are looking at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit.
Nazareth's nerve, and I'll tell you how much a dollar costs
The price of having a place in heaven, accept your loss: I am God "
I washed my hands, I said my grace
What else do you want from me?
Shades of gray will never change if I pass
Turn this page, help me change my mistakes
K. Dot
See how K. Dot moves, something you don't like
See how K. Dot moves, something you don't like
Have your gun with you, cause the niggas will try you
Who is sick like me?
And as far as my eyes can see
And let the real deals be dealt with
You ladies like Leon Phelps
I piss on any man trying to discontinue my health
I don't give a damn how you feel or how you felt
Your little mercy won't help
When the shots circulate around your waist like designer belts
I design your face, the [?] Lifts you up
Rock niggas like Bobby Boucher, you water boy
What do you want, grass, drugs or water, boy?
It's right here, and you guys catch up, I move fast like light years
Now go back to basics
K. Dot is nothing to play with
My grade point average at the top of the brackets
I'm sick as a cancer patient
Assist many players as a personal agent
You all are disgusting, fragrant clothes
I am the best now
So whatever you have
As if you were in a bag
Put it in the trash or in the trash, I'm the best thing you had
K. Dot, then heaven sent
7.6.5
4.3.2
one
I kick a friendly and funky conversation that makes them upset
You can't complain about the flow I got
I let my thoughts drift with the astronauts
As the white boys say: "Pass the pot"
Let me smoke for a minute ...
As god as a witness, I will never abuse this hip hop
I'll never pretend to be something that I'm not
Give you something to rock other than hardcore rap, possible
Not being focused with your eyes open.
They say 90% of humans don't even notice
Without you knowing that people were laughing at you
They say the worst case scenario is when they have to catch you
You wake up from your mind, all your thoughts are puzzled
You're doing things like trying to touch your shadow
Now here is something realistic, is it something that can happen or is it just a trick?
You never know until your bear witnesses
Witness...
Witness...
She came, you fucked up
She left and you jumped on the truck, you
You took off your shirt because it was burning outside, you
The skirt tipped over, but your gun was hidden
Under the seat, you headed to Long Beach
Get on the 710, the travel sharing lane
Just because you have black tint and can't see a thing
Your check engine light appeared, feels like bad luck or not
But one lane before you got there, your car stopped
Stop
If you were listening for the past two minutes
So you just did 90% accurate hypnosis
Now you have a body
Put your lips on me
You have to be the baddest bitch I've ever seen
Your girl looks better than you
I'm going to go hard, so hard until I break the blood vessel in my damn arm
Beat the wood grain, beat the wood grain until it breaks my fucking palm's blood vessel
It breaks the blood vessel of his damn eye every time I pass and they look at the charm
I laugh at them like this, with my seat reclined all the way back
And the heat lay just right below it
Clap, clap, brr, brr, that's the sound of my gat
That's the sound of a 100 bullet drum, like a brass band, I'm a foot guy
I'm going to clench my fist, I'm going to wave my hand until it gets the president's attention, fuck
Presentation suite, laying, laying on nothing but money
Reminds me of Buffy, please remind me to fuck her after this freestyle
100 karat black I'm the golden boy
Metal jacket, shit, going pow, pow
Blow your brain, let it hang, let the neighbors talk about it, then skip the test
I'll fuck them up, cut them off, shoot them in the foot or just hit them
Now I'm on another shit, we're not on the same page
You don't stick to the script
Let a 100 round clip stick to your lip like Carmex
Blood or cripple, I don't give a shit about any of that
You all can understand it, boy, it's more than rap
Training day, I teach you niggas how to rap
I rap like I have angels on my back
God given, I never walk in the booth without the Holy Ghost
I kick lyrics like Jet Li
They make money to put your boy on the beach
Shit, sand on my feet
Tell me what the fuck do you know about me
Welcome to the wild side, the wild side of the city of Hub
Where the tecs fly that's murder, my stacks like a mile high
Fly like a bitch, I have a cloud 9 condo
Hit the box with God, jump from the sky and parachute
5-6 with five nines, two mac-10s and nine Glock
However, let's do this whenever I tell them I'm ready
The waters run long before Katrina breaks the levee
Look mate, I'm not a gangster, I'm not a murderer
But please think I know a lot of gangsters who will kill you
I don't like you, I don't feel you, you're very unknown
That's not your favorite rapper in the booth
It's a dead corpse once K.dot kicks the mayhem
Bitch niggas like canines click and click click click boom
Smell the fumes in my Levis
Bitches take pills and mushrooms in my hotel rooms
I squeeze the cock through his thick thighs and then bounce like this T.Dot beat
Six televisions in my new SUV F-U-C-K-Y-O-U pay me
Genesis is not shit, I know local minions
Come shoot me, I'm in a two-seater with hootie, motherfucker
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Wild side of the city of Hub
Welcome to the wild side
Wild side of the city of Hub
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Welcome to the wild side
Wild side of the city of Hub
Where tecs fly, that's murder
My stacks like a mile tall
No one prays for me
It was that day for me
Way (yeah yeah)
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime grants
Finesse a nigga with some fakes, but now I'm counting this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm depressed
D'USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for analysts
Girl I can buy you the ass of the world with my pay stub
Ooh, that good pussy, won't you sit it in my taste blood?
I get too stingy once you let me do the extras
Pull up your block, then break it down: we play Tetris
AM to PM, PM to AM, funk
Piss off your diets, you just have to hate them, funk
If I leave your BM, I keep riding Mercedes, funk
My left stroke went viral
Right punch put lil 'baby spiraling
They are levels, you and I know
Bitch, be humble (Hol 'up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol 'up, lil', hol 'up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (Hol 'up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol 'up, sit down, lil', sit down, little bitch)

Be humble (Hol 'up, hol' up)
Bitch, sit down (Hol 'up, hol' up, lil 'bitch)
Sit down (Hol 'up, hol' up, hol 'up, hol' up)
Get off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Take off my dick, that's not right
I make a move fucking all your life
I'm so sick and tired of Photoshop
Show me something natural like afro in Richard Pryor
It'll still take you straight to your mom's couch in polo socks
I blew great from AC, ayy, Obama called me, ayy
I don't make it, ayy, most of you will be pretending, ayy
I keep myself modest about it, ayy, she put it together, ayy
This that Gray Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
See my soul speak, you let the medicines speak, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the truest nigga after all
Bitch, be humble (Hol 'up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol 'up, lil', hol 'up, lil' bitch)
Be humble (Hol 'up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol 'up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil 'bitch)

Be humble (Hol 'up, bitch)
Sit down (Hol 'up, sit down, lil', sit down, lil 'bitch)
Be humble (Hol 'up, hol' up)
Bitch, sit down (Hol 'up, hol' up, lil 'bitch)
Be humble (Lil 'bitch, hol' up, bitch)
Is this microphone on? (Hey, move like this, like this)
Hey hey hey Turn up the microphone, come on, come on
Is the microphone on or not? I want the microphone
We are not raising anyone, nobody ...
No one but the number one rapper in the world
He traveled the world
He came back just to give you a game
All the boys and girls, come here.
(One two, one two, what's going on, fool?)
Kendrick Lamar, make some noise brother
I've been through a lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God.
The devil wants to put a bow tie on me
Pray that the holy water does not dry out
As I look around
So many motherfuckers want to knock me down
But an enemy never drowns me
In front of a dirty double mirror they found me
And (I love me)
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the police head
(I love myself)
Enlightened by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy
One day at a time
Gun in the hood, police mafia
Rock in the corner with a line for the devil
These days of frustration keep you all tucked in and rotated (Come to the front)
Dreams of peace of reality.
Blowing steam on the face of the beast
Look at me motherfucker, I smile
And (I love me)
When you look at me, tell me what you see.
(I love myself)
(I love myself)
Illuminated-
You all will come to the front, you will come to the front
(I love myself)
(Crazy, what are you going to do?)
Raise your head and keep moving, (keep moving) raise the microphone
(It follows you)
Peace to the fashion police, I carry my heart
In my sleeve, let the track begin
You know the miserable love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everyone lacks confidence, everyone lacks confidence
How many times was my potential anonymous?
So I promise you this, nigga
(I love myself)
When you look at me, tell me what you see.
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the police head
(I love myself)
Illuminated by the hand of God, boy doesn't seem shy
(I love myself)
Huh (walk my bare feet) Huh (walk my bare feet)
Huh (Down, deep valley) Huh (Down, deep valley)
(I love myself) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum) Huh (Fi-fie-fo-fum)
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, no one calls a doctor.
I'll do it until I get it right
I've been dealing with depression since I was a teenager
Crouching down every two blessings, I can never see the message
I could never take the initiative, I could never move and weave
From a negative point and let them annihilate me
Not in me, not while I'm up here
Not in my time, kill the music, not in my time
We could save that shit for the streets
2015, niggas tired of playing victim dog
Niggas is not trying to play victory. You, how many niggas did we lose?
Yan-Yan, how many did we lose?
This, only this year
Exactly, so we don't have time to waste time, my nigga
Niggas gotta make time brother
The judge a long time ago, you know, the judge a long time ago, right?
The judge makes time for it not to be shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come here and appreciate what little life we have left, dog
You know it
Exactly, enough said, enough said
And we'll go back to the show and keep going, 'cause that shit is petty to my nigga
Microphone check, microphone check, microphone check, microphone check, microphone check
Let's do some acapella shit before we get back to ...
I promised Dave that I would never use the phrase "fuck nigga"
He said, "Think about what you're saying," Fuck niggas. "
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats "
It seems like he needed a little soul searching
My Pops gave me a game in real person
I did my homework fast before the government caught me
So I'm going to dedicate this verse to Oprah
On how the infamous and sensitive N word controls us
Many artists gave him an explanation to hug us
Well this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia.
Definition N-E-G-U-S: royalty; royalty king - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
America tried to reach a house divided
Friends don't recognize that we've been misusing it
So I'm going to break it down and put my game into a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me or don't say it anymore
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she came just in time
Kendrick Lamar by far the most real Negus alive
We are living in a gold bar (running to the right law)
Duckin 'in the trap (Duckin' in the trap)
Living in a group (Living in a group)
Dedicated to friends in the corral, hit me
(Hey Hey hey)
Uh, this is a world premiere, this is a world premiere
(Hey hey)
Uh, I've been through a lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God.
The devil wants to put a bow tie on me
Pray that the holy water doesn't dry, yeah, yeah
As I look around
So many motherfuckers want to discourage me
But a friend never drowned me
In front of a dirty double mirror they found me
And i love me
Ho, when you look at me, uh, I say to myself: "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the police head
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, it's not that high
I love myself
Uh, one day at a time, the sun is gonna shine
Everyone looks at you crazy (crazy)
What are you going to do? (What are you going to do?)
Or let paranoia chase you (chase you)
Peace to the fashion police, I carry my heart
In my sleeve, let the track begin
You know the miserable love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everyone lacks confidence
I love myself
When you look at me, I say to myself, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the police head
I love myself
Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy, don't seem shy
I love myself
One day at a time the sun will shine
I mean it's a war outside, bomb on the street
Gun in the hood, police mafia
Rock in the corner with a line for the devil
And a bottle full of lean and a model in an outline
(These days of frustration keep everyone in position and rotation)
Aw, man, I dodge these cold faces, I post a fee for smoke
Blowing steam on the face of the beast
The sky can fall, the wind can cry now
Strong in me, I still smile
I love myself
Uh, when you look at me, uh, I say to myself, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the police head
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't be shy
One day at a time the sun will shine
Everybody hit me
Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)
Fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum)
My heart undone (my heart undone)
Aw man, ay, look at this
Do you feel what I'm talking about? Do you dig that
Sometimes I feel a little b-next to myself
This is the return of Enoch
And we are going to do all of you like this
Here we go, one, two, three, hit me
I love myself
The world is a ghetto with big guns and Dickies signs.
I love myself
But you can do whatever you want when you want and I don't care
I love myself
Said I should get up, life is more than suicide
I love myself
One day at a time, the sun will shine
No one call a doctor
I've been dealing with depression
Crouching down every two blessings, I can never see the message
Obvious, I'm moving at a meteorite speed
Finna meets a building there
Hand me over to building the invisible holy
Give me the feeling of the invisible saint
I must have misread what the good book said
Oh, woe is me, it's a jungle inside
Give me again until the well runs dry
YG, chicken wings, I love me
I love me, I love me
Aw, man, ay, ay, friend
I told you it's a Compton thing
Do you dig what I'm talking about?
And this here is dedicated to friends
Do you feel what I'm saying?
Sometimes I get out of myself
The return of the Enoch is back
Do you hear what I'm talking about?
Uh, I've been looking for you all my life
Where you live
In a woman, is it in money or in humanity?
Something has me losing my mind
Where are you front to back
I'm looking for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the dirtiest gun
Maybe you're on a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the rich know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day
I could speak for you if you tell me what's the problem
I could preach to you with the mighty tongue
I am the only one, how can I overcome
Negative energy, more like infinity, and survive?
I see them, they don't understand me
My plan B is to win your hearts before winning a Grammy
You cannot cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
I've been there and I'm gone before you get close
Ooh, that boy reminds me of a young Martin Luther
As Malcolm X did, I defend what I believe
Family, god and honor
From Chicago, my dad and my mom
I came to Compton to accomplish one thing
Raise a king, queen supreme, named Kendrick
I'm not lying, it means king and I am one
From the coochie to the ground
The meek will inherit the earth
Muscle in my heart
Stare into Mozart's eyes, then tell him I'm the genius
Do my dougie and grab my penis
Because I want to say this with all my soul
And you can't control greatness, unless you hate with Satan's heart
But even that can't stop it
Nigga, take out my wallet and put passion in your logic
Passion in your life, the passion of my Christ is in me.
Damn that boy well
Brilliant like Thomas Edison, but with Gucci men's hoodie
You can shoot or cheer because I ... am
Friends say I'm the real one
Bitches think I'm the cutest
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Thank goodness for these rap recordings
I can dance like him in every verse and chorus
Little brother only 5, mom put it on my taxes
That every Section 8 tenant is familiar with
Ooh wee, they say it's kind of like the 70s
You have 80 sevens
Gourmet slippers, hair diaper
That was '05 brother
And I don't use them as a wife if a black is her best friend
What the fuck do I look like?
A million dollars, and that's why
Bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition of what's great
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch I do this
She looks at the car like she wants to fuck it
She looks at the doll like she wants to fuck her
Hating his girlfriend just so he can fuck
She says she's on birth control, no I don't trust him (Ho)
Run until I have a bunion and my feet cramps
I'm in the hot spot, I know your seats are wet
And I don't need your signature, it's a cheap stamp
You niggas check this money and I'm falling GT
105 off the ramp, hey
And the little nigger got it, G5
Going, going, going, gone
Cloud mental state 9
Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie?
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck off
Friends say I'm the real one
Bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition of what's great
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition of what's great
Boy I thought you knew this
She looks at the car like she wants to fuck it
She looks at the doll like she wants to fuck her
She says she's on birth control, no I don't trust that
First of all I'm a rider, bitch
Put 26 on a Silverado, bitch
Snap my fingers she'll go find a bitch
Tell the boys i do this
Got the best product 'in town, Frank Lucas
Ok, metro bread like cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
Wild as a Haitian, he should establish a store in Haiti
Fuck you, pay me. Paper on the pussy, black
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition of cool is
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Friends say I'm the real one
Bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition of what's great
Now I prefer women with sexy fingers
No calluses but enjoy eating vegetables
It seems that everyone loves the role of assholes
But I feel better being crowned with some bad hoes
Mr. Michael from Amish, you talking
I heard they fell in love with my penis
I'm only worried about my balls like Venus
Huh, they say I'm rolling like a big shot
Let's say, I'm in a big way, Flavor Flav on a wristwatch
And all these chickens want that rooster, call it Big Cock
Co-co-co-cock that point and shoot that sure shot
U-N-I, T.D.E. do it so go and jump
In that car of my genitals, it's not new to me
Friends say I'm the real one
Bitches think I'm the cutest
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition of what's great
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch I do this
Oh Lord, here it comes, there they go again
Kendrick got my cover fire, bitch, I'm going in
I burn a swisher and then I roll again
Ee-Jay and Weezy, just make sure the dough keeps rolling, ha!
I have the world going crazy
Big Chrome .380 if a nigga tries to play me
I was never like you or I wanted to be, I was
She found out I'm in a group, now she's a groupie
I don't need a watch full of diamonds to know it's the perfect time
Yes, keep it simple, stupid, everything I see is fashionable around me
T.D.E. the move, we Sore Losers out of Dallas County
Country accent, urban fashion, lights flicker on cameras
Friends say I'm the real one
Bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition of what's great
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition of what's great
Bitch I do this
These hoes want to love me, man
So I'm like, what's up? Uh what's up
Uh, bitch, I do this stupid remix, burning fire, looting people
That's the chaos, it comes from K. Dot swinging swords and hanging ropes
Call me hot or call me Pac, all eyes on me and obviously
I'm close as next to the kingdom, I only run my city friend
You just make your city work, they hate being by your side
I'm about to burn that halo, damn it, that's kind of ironic
I am the messiah of society
Next to a Halle Berry, give me to eat berries in Paris, oui-oui
I make a great effort, ambition leaves pain to all men
Like Mason Betha's beliefs, reporting from motherfucker C-P-T
Bitch I do this
Bitch I do this
The definition of what's great
Bitch I do this
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh
Who Says West Coast Niggas Know Nothing About Real Hip-Hop?
I'm about to give you an excellent example
Where are my nickels?
.45's Mac 10's and nine in?
If it's 12 of you, the shells bubble like Alka-Seltzer
Want to die? I can help you
Put the beef aside and [?] The contents of the shit from the street to the block, parents advised
Mike Jordan at its peak
Call me Jeff Gordon on that hardtop drifting between the lines
Uncle Bobby is still incarcerated, Grandma died in Las Vegas
Grandpa moved to Mississippi
I can't really tell if the guy missed me
Probably stretched out on the floor, with an empty bottle of whiskey next to the earlobe.
More reason why my heart is cold
Before going too far, the feds raided the study
We try to make songs, but they don't listen
Why did you have to do that?
I wish Pro Tools was registered
I know I'm walking the path of greatness, no compass
Not an atheist, but bars reside with Satan
Drowning the microphone, releasing my frustration
I'd rather do it before I see the court cases
Locked up by Caucasians, claustrophobic
Boxed like a new Porsche rolling
Stones on my wrist, iceberg, Titanic frozen
K. Dot is in my colon
Victim of modern warfare
Oh I'm gross join my coalition
Don't snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant
Feel unforgiving, new apprentice
King of understanding
No competition
Compton is back, pump your fist like that and that
Without subliminals, I'm listening, facing the facts
You are a disgrace to this rap business
Just a one man office, need help
Hidden pistol, walk in the club, activate sensors
And anyone wants to go to rap legends, without question
I gave you the rhyme scheme before studying English
I say I'm better than most who say that they are the ones who gave them loot
The flow, the development of the artist.
Is it me who gave you growth?
You didn't bloom alone, someone had to plant the seed
The sun shines, and now king me
Kodak moment that has been caught, cheese
Lord forgive me
Kill him where he is standing and stand on him
Shake your hand and then jump in that minivan
Double back to your block and blam
I don't back down for nothing
I'm back down like Shaq
With this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Medical examiners comfort your mom
"Mom, he's dead" the next morning
I toasted with my friends, we drink and smoke marijuana
Do you want us to change our ways? Uh huh
You see that this game we play comes from
Guys who raised me in Compton
I don't know, I have no conscience
I just loaded up and start pulling
On enemies; I'm hunting heads, no sympathy, no love
When you're on these streets, just get something
Protect your neck because they come
For sets, respect, divide your onion
Then cut your deck
Your head turns like gymnastics (Ooh ...)
Because ignorance is happiness
Now everybody put your hands up
We all try the ball, and when I have the rock, I'll take off
Then take off on a hooptie
Go back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
And bitches want to greet or seduce me
Undoubtedly, I am too stray; undoubtedly it's me
Better than your bitch cause your niggas are too weak
But just give me two weeks and I'm fine
I'll make an album that will smile at Malcolm
Have Martin Luther tell God that I am the future for heaven's talent
There is no tarot card reading; I'm envisioning you niggas disappear
Not just from the rap game, I'm including the planet
The cats that watery clowns can sink the Titanic
Tie the titanium around their neck and panic
Give me respect, damn it, or hurt me
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently you are a parrot, making fun of me and my plan
But I won't share it, I'll just make you copy it, then I'll call you sheriff
But honestly, every shooter calls me Compton
So honestly you just call me Kweli and Common?
Now everybody put your hands up
If you don't give a shit, put your hands up
And this is still the hardest shit you've ever heard of LA so far
And I'm so far away from a download, but I will never reject them
This is my world, I grab the universe and then I play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hit so hard
I'm So-Cal, you so-called rappers should call
Ghostbusters because your hunters are Casper when I go
I introduce myself, to show and show off
And if you are, then destroy your car
And walk to my crime scene
I remember being 17, wishing someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels give me back
Is when they rewind me
Backing bargains, backing up bitches
Let's flip it
Once she gets out of that blue dolphin, you'll tip her
Because ignorance is happiness
And Willie B, I'm a fool with your heartbeat
I bleed the speaker
September 22, 2009
Kendrick Lamar
For for ...
Let me start this letter by saying I don't like you
I look at the ceiling and I think of you
Curiosity is killing me, thinking about when will I find you
Why do you love people who love people who do the right thing?
Is it rocket science for you or is it just your type?
Or maybe a family member you thought was great
Or maybe a person I will never know from you
And I swear I would blow your brain if you visit me
But that is not realistic, because you will never rot
But I'm still going to send this letter
POST. Box, and when you get it ...
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal
I'm afraid of you but I will fight with you
I should be ashamed of the movements you make
The pain you bring, the sadness and the hearts you break
Every day you remind me that you are always there
Because every time I come someone is being knocked down
Then the Lord responds: "I can't help you, boy!"
That is screwed up, my life is screwed up, it was cursed before I was born
And what is screwed, I have to live my life with pain
Inhabiting the masses
Snatching bodies
Probably on my notepad as I write
Why the fuck do you want to take my life?
So when I write on this paper
It's a real talk
So...
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal
Let me start this letter by saying I don't like you too
And the reason we haven't met because I've been busy doing whatever it takes since elementary school
I've seen all your movements
You slipped a few times, I gave you a pass
Everyone wants to know why I act this way
Let's say I had a bad day
Made of matter, every day
I was born to be a party pooper, I'm an old brat
Conceived by Adam and Eve, who are you mad at?
Not me, do you see me? I'm just doing my job
And you dodge me? Are we a stranger?
So why send this letter like I never met you?
I'd rather knock on your door and give it to you
It's everywhere
The streets, the corners, the coroners, the morgues, the cemeteries, the hospitals.
I heard it when I was little
Tomorrow is not promised, because any day can knock on your door
War, genocide, homicide, suicide, they all coincide
Do it, don't take it
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Please take it personal
Because it's personal
The hardest thing for me to do
It is having you, knowing me, within sixteen bars
That is the hardest
Who is K. Dot? A young black man from Compton
On the sidewalk writing raps next to a shot
In the corners where the gangsters and the murderers live.
The tender fraudulent scars that are discovered
Everyone he knew was either Crip or Piru.
I was pointing something at my head, I needed to survive
They jumped me, kicked me, shot me, shot me
And I don't even push a line, I'm just trying to push these rhymes
In the midst of remaining neutral and discreet
My mom said you are judged by the company you have
But what you can consider is that if it goes down
I am trying to avoid the influence of my city that is developing, to really speak and
That's why I get screwed (real talk nigga, believe it)
That's why I get screwed (do what I do, you know?)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the most real you know
When an unidentified vehicle appeared, and I was like "hol 'up"
"Where are you from?" I don't hit
"Where you stay?" Westside, that's a Piru gang to be exact
He dropped the backpack and ran into the dead end
Gunshots rang out, hoping God wasn't wet
He crossed Rosecrans and ran into the
Friends screeched on I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and see you outside the garage
He grabbed the nine ball, opened the door, and then entered
Somebody said "go back, let's make these niggas suffer
I thought about that so long that I had failed my finals, dammit, but
That's why they screw me over (I told you, nigga)
That's why they fuck me (fake nigga)
I'm not a gangster, I'm not a murderer, I'm just your average Joe (you're fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the most real you know
I don't make black music, I don't make white music
I make music from everyday life
Give it cuts like a nigger stuck a knife through it
You say it, but I've been through it, now it's cold
And this is for my county building kids
In Hub City in hubcaps, without power steering
I use perseverance in this crazy city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for killers
Bernie Mac died, no kidding
Don't ask why if you don't know about these murderers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I'm out of life
I could fall from the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AK
And minivans where the fan is never on
Because it's hotter than a lunatic's armpits in a straitjacket
In other words, we make it cracked, but I keep it cool, you know?
So they fuck me (haha)
That's why they fuck me (real conversation)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the most real you know
But I'm going to leave you with this
An O.G. once told me
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I left
Ladies and gentlemen! My man Kendrick Lamar!
Living in america
Thuggin 'in the trap
Living in a groove
Watching TV
Dedicated to friends in the corral, hit me!
I've been through a lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God.
The devil wants to put a bow tie on me
Pray that the holy water doesn't dry, yay yay
As I look around
But an enemy never drowns me
In front of a dirty double mirror they found me
(And I love me)
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, think that
Uh, one day at a time, the sun is gonna shine
Everyone looks at you crazy (crazy)
What are you going to do? (What are you going to do?)
You know the miserable love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everyone lacks confidence, everyone lacks confidence
How many times does the city make promises to me?
So I promise this, huh?
(I love myself)
Uh, when you look at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the police head
(I love myself)
Uh, God's illuminated hands, boy you don't seem shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, the sun will shine
When they say it's a war outside, bomb on the street
Gun in the hood, police mafia
Rock in the corner with a line full of demons
(These days of frustration keep everyone in position and rotation)
Oh man
(I lower these cold faces, I publish the bases fi-fie-fo-fum)
Uh, dream of the peace of reality
The sky could fall, the wind could cry now
(I love myself)
Huh, when you look at me, tell me, what do you see?
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the police head
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't be shy
(I love myself)
One day at a time, the sun is going to shine, everyone, hit me!
(Walk my bare feet, walk my bare feet)
(Down, down the deep valley, down, down the deep valley)
Oh man, hey, check this out, this is a real Compton thing right now, do you feel what I'm talking about? Did you already dig that? Sometimes I get a little out of myself, you know what I'm talking about? Here's Enoch's return, and we'll make it like this, here we go: one, two, three, hit me!
And i love me
(But you can do whatever you want when you want, I don't care)
I love myself
(Said I have to get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, the sun will shine)
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, no one calls a doctor.
I'll do it until I get it right
War last night
I've been dealing with depression, bending over every other blessing
I could never see the message, I could ...
I could never take the initiative, never shake and weave
Negative letting me annihilate
Obvious, I'm moving at a meteorite speed
Finna meets a building, put my ...
Money on the roof lay my body on the street
Glory to the feeling of the invisible saint
I lost my head
Ah man, ay, ay friend, I told you it's a Compton thing, do you understand what I'm talking about? And this here is dedicated to friends. Do you feel what I'm saying? And sometimes I get out of myself. The return of the Enoch is back, do you hear what I'm talking about?
Uh, I've been looking for you all my life, appetite
For this feeling that I can hardly describe, where do you live?
Something's driving me crazy
I'm looking for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you in the ghetto
When I was 17 with the .38 special
Maybe only the rich know how you feel
I could be your lawyer
I could speak for you if you tell me what's the problem
I could preach to you with the mighty tongue
I am the only one, how can I overcome
Negative energy while I give infinitely and survive?
These streets are Jurassic, cowards become thematic
Astronauts float in the atmosphere.
That is the ghetto bird. Lift the curve
"Wassup homie!", Smoke a nigga and then dive
Strangle your perfect tag for an accent
This is the Jesus of Nazareth
Spitting gold politics into an unknown world
In a low, low cherry with four grassy areas
No sticks no seeds
Prestigious when I hit all 50 states
My need to speak can corner the larger crowds
Mosh pit, with a big dick screaming "Bitches ain't shit!"
She gobble gobble for hours, I jumped in the shower
I dismantle it, I devour the harder Emcees, softer than clam chowder
Dangerous danger for instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein.
I am corrupted
I am corrupted
Verbally useless
Catch you, hang yourself, from any loop
Young and I'm ruthless
21 with 21 pistols, shot and saluted for Pac
Bitch, you're a bitch in disguise, and bitches get ten
Bullets to your midsection, Mr. lethal injection
In the region higher than the church steeples
I'm a pterodactyl tearin your squad as forgiveness
Me and Terrace Martin enacting Martin
Cannibal coexisting with the coldest, that means I'm the sickest
And Thera-flu won't, as long as she's kicking the evil
I am corrupted
I am corrupted
I'm from C-O-M-P-T-O, any black can get it
The little friend tied and he with him
Forceful longer than Rosecrans
I grab the devil and then I dance slow
Practice trigonometry
Practice my aim on the rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches
West coast with a powerful range kill all yal
It's Top Dawg, TDE, CPT
Quick to tell a bitch to jump on my dick A-S-A-P
Composer full of havoc, disorder: addicted to rhyme
Slaughterhouses full of Joeys, Joells and Royces for you
Live from the 310 area code
Laughing up to the bank with 3 elmos
Three 64's, 1 bottle of goose
i am the truth
You can put your hand on the bible and shoot
I am corrupted
I sit on the sofa in the study
Ask me what the hell am I thinking
A record from Dr. Dre, imagine, I walk away 600 seconds
K. Dot had become curious George
You know, out of difficulties is what I'm curious about
What if Pac had never looked at Holla at the girls?
Before turning right to shoot out the door
They say Suge did it, but he was in an emergency clinic.
Then he would risk his own life, to kill someone else
But in the process, getting hurt doesn't make sense
It's like the Da Vinci Code, trying to solve the crime of these rap souls
I never went to Los Angeles, would it make any difference to those bullet holes?
Would it make my flow flow more persistent?
It would raise the bar for the competition, who knows
Who told Nastradamus that his mom was fucking HOV?
Would the battle be less interesting if it were not personal?
If Jay wasn't intimate, there probably would be fewer people listening
People think it's a publicity stunt
What if he partnered with Jay and still didn't explode?
Hip-hop would really be screwed
Something like Milli Vanilli
Nothing different, quite similar
Filling my mental capacity
Thinking of Martin Luther, on the balcony
What if the shooter
Better yet, what if Malcolm were
Killed two birds with one stone, both would have died
Now we're going to rewind
Before we go
You can imagine?
Picture years, with your mom
You can imagine?
Hang your photo in the sky
You can imagine?
Call emergency, I've been dreaming all my life
Imagine if Tookie was a Blood, look, without disrespecting him
Dominating the population of
Important fact, imagine if we really didn't start this gangster shit
They would have nothing to spit
No passes, no flags pulling pockets
There are no NWA guys, they just rap like Cre Cru
Feet not paralyzed, would he be alive?
No match, no cars at that entrance
In this Los Angeles strip, would these rap n * ggas use their name?
No, what if rap niggas never had rap if they tried to resort to this drug game
Now these rappers are trapped with cocaine
Not smoking, but slang
Imagine the people who don't know these rap niggas are crazy
Just think about it
Imagine life without death, would you feel alive?
Your people who passed, what if they never died?
Street life, what if the crack epidemic
I never got to the projects and we destroyed our buildings.
Most of us become murderers, innocent victims
Imagine if heroin didn't affect our system
They say drug money funds labels today
What about the drug money that the C.I.A is financing
Imagine if they really tried to fix these streets
Would they start in the neighborhood or in the executive suites?
Where the real criminals meet and the directors fight me
You could possibly live without heat
Imagine if Al Gore had won that election
Would the Twin Tower buildings still be erected?
Imagine the penal system without witness protection.
Would there be so many cowards on the stand saying
I don't know, I'm just saying what I think
Lost in my own soul, just press rewind and imagine
(Training day, training day)
Look, I'm the man, tell Roger that
I got bitches breaking glasses trying to scream
My fat pockets, if they don't get there
That's VIP, nigga, you'll never get in there
Look, I inspire conversation with dollar signs
Are you talking about money or are you still the mime
That means big brain
I swear to God every time I go out a vein jumps
And you won't make it until you get into that Jewish love
I'm talking about Seinfeld, Ben Stiller, Wall Street, bank tellers
You will see the lightsaber throwing jewels, Marc Jacobs
You know
This is for my motherfuckers Compton
And all the wild blocks that drove us crazy
The Dominguez Hospital is born
Niggas die fast without life insurance
Bullets have no names, so if a girl gets hit, the response is like our bad
Say hi to Norman Bates of hip hop
I don't even burn them yet
Well done when the second comes
I have an acquired taste
I will eat all day
I'm sitting on my crossed legs like I have shoes (?)
I tell you friend, I'm not worried about these types of rap
They're not in my league, the west coast is me
I put it on Hov like I had (Calvin Jeans)?
I'm a nightmare on Elm Street, come through your dreams and
Say hi to the team, right?
The world is eager for my LP
Get pop ratings, I get an A-plus, you get a D
What money does that have to do with it?
When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
Institutionalized, I keep running for a visit, hol 'up
I said that I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I'm not proud to admit it.
Institutionalized, you could still kill me a nigger, so what?
If I were the president
I'd pay my mom's rent
Free them and my friends
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lie down in the White House and position yourself, Lord
Who thought
Master, take off my chains!
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
Zoom zoom zoom
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
Zoom zoom zoom
Zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
Zoom zoom zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom, shit
Life for me, like a box of chocolate.
Quid pro quo, something for something, that's obvious
Oh shit, the flow is so sick, don't swallow it
I can only ease the politics of the rap industry
Milk game, never be lactose intolerant
The last remnant of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, the streets put me in schools
I know everything you can be, right, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if the job doesn't follow
Remind me of the friends who used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truth be told, they are all spoiled, usually you are never accused
But something came over you once I took you to the damn BET awards
You look at the artists as if they were crops
So many Rollies around you and you love them all
Someone told me that you think about stealing jewelry
I should have listened when my grandmother told me
Shit doesn't change until you get up and wash your ass, nigga
Shit doesn't change until you get up and wash your ass, boy
Oh now slow down
And once, in such a divine city
Called West Side Compton, there was a little black
He was five and a half feet, God bless the boy
He took his friend on the show and this is what they said
The constant talk of a lot of money about the mansion and the foreign whips
Private jets and passport, the presidential glass floor
Bottles of gold, models of gold, giving the ass for
Instagram movies, sucking dick, fuck, is this it?
My defense mechanism tells me to catch it
Quickly because he got it
No more poor life, meet my four and four
Now Kendrick, I know they are your coworkers.
But it's going to take a long time before this gun gets cold
Now i can see your watch on tv and be fine
But look, I'm on the clock once I see LA land
Well, that's me at these awards. "
I guess my grandmother was warning a child
She said...
Shit doesn't change until you get up and wash your ass, nigga
Shit doesn't change until you get up and wash your ass, boy
Oh now slow down
And once, in such a divine city
Called West Side Compton, there was a little black
Talented but still under the trick of the neighborhood
But you can't take off your friend's hood
Hollywood is nervous
Fuck you, good night, thank you very much for your service
My first day, you fucking fans in this building, once. As I look around, this is the shit. I haven't been that intimate in a long time. We could be here all damn night, I have something. I haven't seen them in a minute, really shit. You know I'm serious when I say, I've been all over the world and that shit. A whole sea of people. But nothing like coming here in front of this small group. The people who have been with me from day one. Kendrick Lamar EP. Kendrick Lamar OD. Section-mothefucking-.80. Real shit. This is cool here, damn it, this is really cool right now. This is real shit, listen. For pimp a butterfly. People said a lot about this album. That had said album of the year, that album of this generation and all that shit. That's great, but also real shit to make this album therapy. Not just for you, but for me. You know what I'm saying? Because at six months as a good boy, the fall of the city of m.A.A.d., the life of what he knew, when he knew what he was, thinking he knew, changed completely in six months. And uh, you are going through the movement of the world telling yourself that you are great. And you try to make yourself believe that shit, but it's difficult because you're institutionalized where you come from. I still try to move and stay the way I like. I am a discreet black. And I am not afraid of the world. Me personally, I can't run with a hundred niggas like I usually do. I don't need, I don't want. And that's me from day one. So trying to understand the idea of being told who to run with can't help it. Because as I said on the EP Kendrick Lamar, "I need to be me, damn it." I think this shit can live forever, but looking at all of them alone. I have some of the most loyal ones. dedicated shit fans in the world (?). (?) I could talk all day (?). For pimp a butterfly. They allowed this crappy album to skyrocket to the top without any crappy commercial success. You all allowed me to be top notch without a single constant radius and shit. So that shows you that music is not something you can sell all the time. This shit belongs to you and only you, you know what I say? Shit that all of you can feel if you are insecure, if you are vulnerable, if you are angry, happy, angry or sad. You play this damn tape, you play your favorite music, and you love and live that shit. And you allow artists like me to come back to this group of people and do the shit I want to perform, do you understand what I'm saying? This may be the first and last time I do To Pimp a Butterfly in this race. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York was one of those cities I go back to do this shit. So with that said, let's shake this shit until the coffin falls or until everything falls. Let's go
Greetings people
Now you're rocking with the best
The Hub City threat
Minor of the year.
K.Dot
I know the hood has been waiting, right?
I'm going to stop being stingy
I will share with all of you
Who thought young Kendrick would spit so ignorant
Have the street disciples go and get a membership
Revival of the streets like the Creflo dollar in the strip
This is the church
You all rhyme carelessly, I rhyme appropriately
Monopoly dollars jam putting 100% on each verse
Add 10% more and what you get
A skinny nigger manipulating the innocent
Militant mind, nigga don't try
Try to keep the peace, because I promote violence.
Don't rap
They all make a lot of noise like sirens
So I'm here to shut the shit up
Transform your city
I'm not Diddy, but I'm still a bad boy
Where no man has trodden, no man has represented
No man can bear all the nights I've slept
Fucking with me, you could lose your breath
I will take you to the pearly doors
The golden streets
Do you believe
Kendrick is the god
Weezy Up, K. Dot
Friend K. Dot, he's crazy too
I sign this, I also shout to my friend Jay Rock, he is also my nigga
Your nigga Shit
I co-sign it
This is a world premiere!
This is a world premiere!
I've been through a lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God.
Satan wants to put me on a bow tie
In front of a dirty double mirror they found me
And i love me
(The world is a ghetto with big weapons and posters)
I love myself
(But you can do whatever you want when you want, I don't care)
I love myself
I love myself
(One day at a time, the sun will shine)
They all look at you crazy (crazy)
What are you going to do? (What are you going to do?)
Raise your head and keep moving (keep moving)
Or let paranoia chase you (chase you)?
Peace to the fashion police, I carry my heart
In my sleeve, let the track begin
You know the miserable love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
How many times was my potential anonymous?
How many times does the city make promises to me?
So I promise this
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big weapons and posters)
I love myself
(But you can do whatever you want when you want, I don't care)
I love myself
I love myself
(One day at a time, the sun will shine)
They mean that it is a war outside and a bomb on the street
And a gun on the hood, and a crowd of cops.
And a rock in the corner, and a line for the devil.
And a bottle full of lean meat, and a model on the scene, yeah
These days of frustration keep them all tucked in and rotated
I lower these cold faces, I publish pe-f-fo-fum
Dreams of peace of reality.
Blowing steam on the face of the beast
I love myself
(The world is a ghetto with big weapons and posters)
I love myself
(But you can do whatever you want when you want, I don't care)
I love myself
(Said I have to get up, life is more than suicide)
I love myself
(One day at a time, the sun will shine)
Walk my bare feet (walk my bare feet)
My heart undone (my heart undone) (I love myself)
The world is a ghetto with big guns and signs
(I love myself)
Said I have to get up, life is more than suicide
(I love myself)
One day at a time, the sun will shine
(To hold)
I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, no one calls a doctor.
I'll do it until I get it right
I've been dealing with depression since I was a teenager
Crouching down every two blessings, I can never see the message
I could never take the initiative, I could never move and weave
From a negative point and let them annihilate me
And it is evident that I am moving at a meteorite speed
Finna meets a building, leaves my body on the street
Keep my money on the roof let my mom know I'm free
Give the story to the children and a lesson they can read.
And the glory to the feeling of the invisible saint
Seen enough, make a motherfucker scream, "I love myself!"
I lost my head
Oh, trouble keeps me up, it's a jungle inside
Uh, Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
Kendrick has a dream
All my life I want money and power
I respect my mind or I die from the rain
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Damn, I feel amazing, damn, I'm in the Matrix
My mind is living in cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Taking pills in the hall and I pray they don't find her naked
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees there is no need to do this
Park in front of Lueders, next to the chicken of that church
You all pussies are losers, all my niggas are winners, screaming ...
I respect my mind or I die from the lead rain
I pray that my dick gets bigger like the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
All my life I want money and power
I respect my mind or I die from lead showers
Put fire to that ass, body thrown on a stretcher
And her body has that butt that a ruler can't measure
And it makes me run fast, but I'm never ashamed
And I admit you have what I've been waiting for since that record
That Adina Howard had quickly exploited to impress her
She rolls, I hold my scrotum and pose
This voice here is golden, so damn, I go in and ...
All my life I want money and power
I respect my mind or I die from the lead rain
I pray that my dick gets bigger like the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Damn, I got bitches, damn, I got bitches
Damn, I got bitches: wife, girlfriend and lover
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or nigga it's time to go
I roll en masse with good grinding
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, "K, you're going to marry mines."
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! No way
Beeotch! No way, beeotch! Okay
I'm never living the confined life
How I feel you even if I'm blind
I can tell you who, what, when and where
How to sell your game just in time
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! Go to play
Beeotch! Go play, beeotch! I look like OJ
She pussy poppin 'and I got options like an audible, I'll be
All my life I want money and power
So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours
Damn, I got bitches, damn, I got bitches
Damn, I got bitches, wife, girlfriend and lover
I respect my mind or I die from lead showers
Let it run, Ali
Martin had a dream
Martin had a dream
What is behind the other door?
No more silence, don't kill this thing we call love
Just looking for the perfect shot
When love comes calling, don't return love
When love comes calling, don't look the other way
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look the other way
My conscience only knew what was half tight
At 3:14, it's time to give me a slice, my nigga
This is a dogfight, my nigga
The soundtrack of life, my nigga
Kendrick Lamar, his mom called him that
Watched House Party and ate Apple Jacks
Sold Sega games, his cousin sold crack
He pumped Reeboks, his uncles pumped packages
Bomb, fake, jump, ball hit the back
Junta dreams of being an out-of-bounds point guard, Jack
That's because those Compton streets were built not to win.
Excuse me, I'm looking for answers
The good ugly city boy, he's mad because he's handsome
Where is the love?
When love comes calling, don't return love
When love comes calling, don't look the other way
When love comes calling, don't look back
When love comes calling, don't look the other way
Give me a blue Benz, red Porsche, red rank
Give me black bitches, white hoes, new clothes
So give me some dirt, or maybe a G5 will land
Clearport, say hi to the man
Give me prizes, grammies, and let the crowd applaud
My name until the veins in your vocal cords tighten
With that said, give me Tiger Sports endorsement
Give me posters, whatever those people will kill for
Manahattan and 40/40, not 40 but spilled rose
Give me vanity, give me sanity Kurt Cobain
Give me a city where the cameras of Channel 7 presenters are
Give me horror like Amity, no, give me the lists
And if you ever renege, I'll still give you Kendrick Lamar, this is me
When love comes calling, don't return love
When love comes calling, don't look the other way
When love comes calling, don't look the other way
I'm still lost in my own area in the living room
Like I'm dead to the world playing Donny Hathaway
Every sip brings me closer to my destination
Sun shining through the crack in the blind
This morning thinking about what happened over time
It's fading, the world decides, it's not what it used to be
Everything I love doesn't mean what it used to mean
For example spitting a 16
Emotionless feeling numb like thorazine
I used to be nicotine, I was addicted to this rap
Enough drowning in my pain, never put off tomorrow
What you can do today, that's my new motto
With that said, I pull out the bed
Go to the showers, it's time to get this bread, now make dollars
I woke up in the morning, I washed my body, I put some clothes on
After that warm me up like Alonzo Mourning
Because everyone has a gun, it's like they are copier cats
Would be out of style like Adidas and fat laces
Starter jackets and dookie ropes or whatever you favored in the late 80s
I am one of the best Homo Sapiens.
One of the best creations of God.
Show favoritism every time you listen to the album on radio stations
I know you're angry, you don't have to say much, I can feel you hate
Serving MC's as a waitress, Andre Agassi, multi-talented
Half of these niggas don't talk about anything yakity, yakity
Pushing my buttons like plaid shirts, clapping quickly
Actually, Kurt, Bain Co
Ten years in my career, pray to God my brain won't explode, Lord, I'm here
They call me subway sandwich like I give them the cold cuts
Cut from a different fabric, and these Yves Saint Laurent jeans;
They cost a lot
Anything that is personalized, you better believe I'm going to get it
Get tired of it and get rid of it, don't step on Compton facilities without putting your hip on
No matter the crime rate, I'm still happy
Moving at my own pace, because if you don't make dollars
So it really doesn't make sense, and if you can't understand
I scream like a rottweiler behind a backyard fence
I woke up this morning counting my cash
The girls call me now, straight throwin 'the ass
I put my T on, I grabbed my bitch
Tied up my mandrels, sharp as a piece
They used to call me a creature, but now I'm a beast
With my voice on the beat, I am the voice of the streets.
From my head to my feet, I'm bad to the bone
Nigga, I won't stop until I'm added to the throne
Call me Pharrell, boy, I'll keep them Clipse
Trapped in the hood, far from Giligans Island
Nigga, I'm more iller, call me hospital
You got hiccups, I got this fluent like shit nigga
I spit a bar, I directly screw up your shit nigga
Known as a mack, I can influence your bitch
I'm the reason these niggas handcuff them fast
I'm the reason these niggas bitches hate us on the beach
See them on the streets, these niggas don't say a thing
But keep talking, you're not ready for meat
Jay Rock came down to burst a black head on the streets
Wrong place, wrong time, this is how they applaud you black
Raised on projects, money my object
They stand in my way, like a frog I dissect them
They'll shoot you walking down my section
Now you're a verse in my session, they say life is a school
Shit, look at my ghetto report card, straight A student in every class in the gardens
Money on bitches, nigga, I'm ruthless
Money on bitches niggas, rich is my goal
(target) - x4
Yesterday my black man had told me that his brother had died.
A day earlier, her homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before seeing cancer in her mother's eyes.
A month earlier, he lost custody of his daughter.
Six months earlier, her mother said she would not see her father.
And this before he did a year ago when the charges came up
I shook my head, turned around and then found $ 100
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why you keep blessing me
I don't know why I don't know why I don't know why
Yesterday I invaded the privacy of a home.
The day before, my partner had directed me to an area.
I went out and then I saw a black Honda Accord
So today I lay down on my bed, I looked up at the ceiling
I closed my eyes and then wondered how I felt.
I discussed how a saint can play the villain
Is my life a coincidence or only God wants?
See my nigga had that same boy that I didn't know
The bullets have no name, I guess this is meant to
I give them $ 100 and then destroy my gun
Now I know why you keep blessing me
Now I know why you keep blessing me
Now I know why you keep blessing me
Now I know why you keep blessing me
Then i can bless you
Then i can bless you
Then i can bless you
help me sir
I know this grass is burning
And I'm on drink number two
Cold world
Sometimes I think you can help me
But this bus here is temporary.
So i'm talking to you
This sick world will drive a healthy man crazy
Birds falling from the sky, daughters taking babies from their parents
And this is the news that I hear
When my children, nieces and nephews are one year old
I wonder, will it get better?
A little cheddar cheese, when it gets better
But the rest of that is effective
Give you last year's Christmas gift, my bad
But somehow you keep blessing me
But somehow you keep blessing me
But somehow you keep blessing me
But somehow you keep blessing me
If I just keep the faith
I know you'll be there
Sometimes it may not seem like you're there
But you are there
You are everywhere
And I thank you for
Protecting myself on these streets
Of the danger seen and unseen
I never know
What happened the night
Was not there
Something told me to go, so I left
Three were shot after the club
Everyone listening to that little voice
Oh you saved my life
Real rap, I play rhymes of your hat
Can't you see me when I walk into the cabin
Your wish list, K.Dot, yes, I'm the truth
Stuntin, you better get your broom
Cause I'm flying with witches and we're going to the moon
With this album, he debuts on that
I'm so flying that I could float with bats
You know more
Biggie and Pac are behind me like my ghosts.
Because you think they write for me when I get on the fall
This is the freestyle, trick or treat
Pumpkins hitting them on the head
And instead I'm looking at the web
He will continue
Baby, the sex tape killed me
Ye, ye, I'm so flying, now I'm so high
In fact, oh, we're talking about the hurricane
I'm talking about New York, I pray for all of you, know what I mean
Coming straight from Compton, I thought everyone knew
I'm not going to look at the cards yet, because I'm about to flow
We will continue, from the top of the dome
Mavs, you will go home
Teach them to return to my city
Shrink, G
Five times, four times, that's the repetition
Obama, we are not going to talk about Ritt Momney
Because he's crazy, fleeting, fleeting
I don't need to talk about the flow I'm in
If you're going to vote, vote for Obama
He will win, by sho
From the top we will continue to flow
We'll go back to this little punk, it sucks
Mitt Romney, show them how to rap
In fact, this freestyle is only dedicated to him
You're home now with Slim
Your chances, you won't win
You gotta get back to where you came from, boy
It is the rule of the game
What happens
Two fired the stagecoach
I glide over my enemy like skrrt (woah, woah, woah)
I'm killing this shit, don't leave me alone (woah, woah, woah)
We no longer remember who shot, we finished it
Blade Runner, walking on thin ice, admits he is
Hot feet running, I've been nice, I am, legitimate
Luxury girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Pointing out all these flashy cars
Uh, and God knows she's beautiful.
God knows the usual leaving your body sore
She takes the little change she makes to fix her nail cuticles
She plays Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Hitting "Brenda has a baby" while a pervert yelled at her
And she captures the features of a woman, but only 17
She starts running like Flo-Jo, I don't care if Joe Blow
If they have money to spend, a blowjob is a safe option
And sure enough, I don't see a dirty penny
That's ironic
And in his heart, he hates it there, but in his mind he did it where
Rosa Parks is never a factor when she makes ends meet
Pointing out all these flashy cars
And God knows she is beautiful.
God knows the usual leaving your body sore
Its anatomy is the temple of God.
She is always paranoid, she observes the law inside the streets.
Remember the sergeant let her slide and said if she saw
A warm welcome that filled him just below the navel.
He had his eyes closed, previous charges, he had given them up.
I was one block from Lueders Park, I saw a patrol car parked
And in his heart, he hates it there, but in his mind.
He got to where nothing really matters, so he hit the back seat.
Because Rosa Parks is never a factor when she beats the police
Luxury girls on Long Beach Boulevard
And God knows she is beautiful.
God knows the usual leaving your body sore
As she falls like a 12-berth on tour
Suddenly realized she will never escape the charm
Of a black man, white man, who needs satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now it is insensitive.
Sometimes she wonders if she can do it like the nuns do.
But she never heard of the Catholic religion or the redemption of sinners.
That sounds silly, and you can blame it on his mother.
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
10 months before she was 10 she moved
And that's when he touched her
This mothafucka is the reason why Keisha rushes to that.
One block from Lueders Park
And in her heart she hates it there but in her mind
He got to where nothing really matters, still hitting the back seat.
Then he caught a knife inside the bladder
Left for dead, raped on the street
Keisha's song
My little sister 11, I looked at her face
The day I wrote this song, I sat it down and hit play
Luxury girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Pointing out all these flashy cars
Luxury girls on Long Beach Boulevard, oh
Pointing out all these flashy cars
I can tell you what it is, I can tell you what it is not
Fuck a stage name, that's the name they gave me
The only thing I can identify within this business
I'm just a good compton boy who wants to rap
But this monkey on my back, they don't want me to win
I'm trying to follow the dreams, you want me to follow the trends
So to get a dollar, will I sell my soul?
They say anything worthwhile is worth waiting for
There is no time like now, I can shorten my patience
Or give them more dresses, I don't even want the crown
I just want quiet, and nigga, when I get it
You won't get a piece of me, won't you care about your own business?
A rich nigga buys everything you sell him
A broken nigga believes everything you tell him
Well I'm a bankrupt nigga but I still wouldn't listen to you
Even if your hand was on a quote from the Bible, nigga, pfttuh
See I was raised differently
It does not concern you if you were not born in it
I swear we have to move fast, before time passes
My new saying for '0-10 is, why lie?
This is me black, look me in the eye
Nigga, I'm Kendrick ... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick ... Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick ... Lamar
I changed the name because I was tired of being like you
Now I'm finally ready to tell the world who I am, pfttuh
And that used to be a big task
Now I'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass
My character like I don't have confidence
That can marry a Halle Berry or Angelina without cash
I'm about to take advantage of my thoughts
Give you a compass and then tell you you're lost
What I'm about to achieve is something you can't understand
Once vespers arrive, they look at it quickly.
Hoping I don't take your bitch, but I'm on another shit
When I'm done, I'll try to run the government
These are big dreams, the transition from a rapper to a human being.
You can't 'teach' a dean
All because everyone is a facade, my God
All because who I am, Lamar
But my first name must be Kendrick ... Lamar
Nigga, my name is Kendrick ... Lamar
I changed the name because I was tired of being like you
Now I'm finally ready to tell the world who I am, now let's go
But we can't go back ...
Vai se foder, filho da puta, você é um arrombado
Eu não sei because it tries to be great, hand, you are not merda nenhuma
I shouldn't be fodendo with you in any way
I need a player, a chef
Six parceiros know, everyone knows
Vai se foder, mano, no ligue mais mais
You will not know, you will lose a boa mulher
This pau is not in graça
You are smelling for me how I don't know if I receive
As I know you were never banked like waste
Eating your leftovers and your raw meat
This pau is not in graça

All the members of rap Mount Rushmore released new albums in 2013: Kanye, Jay Z, Drake, Eminem, but it was another MC who stole the crown, and he did it with just a handful of verses: Kendrick Lamar, the last one, and possibly best: the rapper will be straight out of Compton.
It turned out that he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his "little brother," a boy from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by the neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a shooting near the home of Kendrick's parents. He stayed for a month, but eventually died of complications from gunshot wounds.
So today, aboard this seven-seater Challenger 300, en route to New York City's Fall Fashion Week, a crowded destination that Kendrick isn't sure if he wants to impress or fuck with, I'm telling about Chad. "It all happened when I was abroad," he says. "I had to Skype him in the hospital bed before he passed away."
It has been a strange year. When it started, Kendrick was already considered a messiah among rap nerds, one of the best rappers to have come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers in history, and since then his legend has spread rapidly.
It actually started late last year, when Kendrick's debut debut album Good Kid, m.A.A.d city fell to universal acclaim. The album, about a day in the life of Compton K. Dot's teenage nerd and his friends as they race in his mother's minivan chasing "that crazy mad Sherane," is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man. , both a deconstruction of the gangster's violent violent tropes and a celebration of its characteristic slow sound. Like a good boy, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple confessionals from a part of the country that most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a cooler interior to fetishize. He is the most linguistic MC in the game, but also the most real, the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed friends trying to entangle him to rob a guy's house, and it is this polarity that makes him listen to the Rey Kendrick feels like you're putting on the smallest three-dimensional hip-hop glasses. Music nods to influences beyond the west coast (Beach House samples, exuberance of the Dungeon family), but at all times, his voice remains singularly focused within a twenty block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:
If Pirus and Crips got along, they'd probably kill me by the end of this song. Good boy, the city of m.A.A.d sold 241,000 copies of the industry the first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick placed a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse on his friend Big Sean's song "Control," a guest spot on a song that didn't even make it to the final record. After Big Sean continues for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick awakens the entire hip-hop universe, calling almost every young rapper in the game: Drake; A $ AP Rocky; J Cole; Tyler the creator; even Big Sean himself. The guy beats Sean in his own song. He also proclaimed himself "the King of New York," which to some ears on the East Coast sounded like a Greek guy entering Troy and pouring rain on Hector's grave.
"Control" leaked to YouTube at the end of the day on August 12; During a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced that he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.
Kendrick's professional momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. The Chad Keaton memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Then she went to Las Vegas to perform at a pool party. He just "came back on set" to cry for a single day, the day we were scheduled to speak. "It can be complicated and confusing," Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for friends killed one day, private jets for fashion parties the next. "From my point of view, I am not only famous, I still live in this world." And when someone at home needs something, "I still have to get that phone call."
It is clear that the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small boy, only five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, he looked like he was talking to a withered rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break and he lay down on the sofa to rest. Just a little curled up with his back turned.
A little later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers appear on my phone: "When the cameras stop working, it doesn't mean that real life will continue." Instantly he had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a photo of Chad: "Rest N Heaven my brother Lil. I saw you become a man. You fought brother. The city stole your life, but not your legacy."
On the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over "Control" was peaking, I followed Kendrick through the backstage maze at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. At one point, he met Drake, and they wrapped themselves in a big hug. It was their first meeting since Kendrick called him on "Control," and of all the slaps in that verse, it felt more personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, giving the boy not just one verse but an entire song. Her second album. After Drake's VMA performance of "Hold On, We Going Home," Kendrick returned to the green room, hooking the hook: I rolled my eyes at you ... He caught mine and smiled. "Look," he joked, "I'm going to be singing my fifth album!"
I put Kendrick on the phone after the BET recording, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public onslaught: "Name names" Control, "sure, but essentially it was a tribute to the teammates Kendrick really cared about. It doesn't give a shit. Most of them took it in that spirit. No Drake "Yes, I guess he took it as a disadvantage," Kendrick said, downplaying the talk about beef. But it was also clear that he doesn't admire Drake, He doesn't see it as any kind of creative influence. When asked if Drake was a mentor or role model, he quickly replied, "No, just the same. If anything. We are all the same. "
"I came from a late study session, sleeping on mom's couch. Now I'm 26, it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, stumbling from the studio, lying down and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking The weirdest shit of all. I'm not very superstitious and all that shit. That's what made him so crazy. It can drive you crazy. Listen to someone you admired for years saying, "Don't let the music die. Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. As if it were there. Just a silhouette. "
Pac's visit changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was recounting in his music and forced him to think more carefully about who was listening to her. "It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinks," he explains. "I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there are people who really can't connect with that lifestyle. They are in the fight."
A few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everyone was silent, looking at cell phones, waiting for news of the after parties. A plan was put together to host a party hosted by Diddy at the Dream Downtown Hotel. But one of the Kendrick Top Dawg guys leaned back and said, "Aw man, I can't go to any club."
Kendrick spoke.
"We have to go."
"Look at you! We have to go. You never have to go."
"You know me," Kendrick explained. "I only go when there is a point. Usually the point is just drinking niggas. But walk around the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!"
"Well," Tiffith said to me, "we're going to have to spend a night with you, because we're about to calm down. You understand."
The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto / VMA Afterparty launch party sounded like it had fallen out of a massive tear in the mid-90s on the west coast wave of the east coast. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene in Dream: the hip-hop Illuminati stalls - Jay, Bey - gaped like a lost Diddy, enraged by the boast of the "King of New York", tried to serve him a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z J. Cole's acolyte, who was cast out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally, Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. "It was all love at that party," he told me on the private plane.
After landing at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I take a trip with Kendrick to Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week launch party in Chelsea hosted by industry doyenne Jenné Lombardo, and in the car she rides, imagining the horror he and his Compton friends could inspire: "We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K. Dot and they niggas Piru."
At the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty screwed up. There is chronic in the air; models wobble on their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call and response to "Swimming Pools (Drank)," a song about his family's dark relationship to chemical dependency: a shot in the head. DRINK. Sit down. DRINK. Get up. DRANK: A six-foot ghostly blonde with a white veil dances around a small model coven. There's something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounts his feverish dreams about the dire consequences of decadence as he presides over a decadent Fashion Week party.
It's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will re-enter the Top Dawg booth, and he hopes to be as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. "I don't know," he says. "It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I will be, how happy I will be or how confused I will be."
At one point the good boy Kendrick raps, "I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew that life can be dangerous." The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the reversal of the consummate rap watcher becoming the watched. How will all of his eyes affect his art? Because it's already 10,000 feet above Compton and it's rising.
Just back off lately
Feel like we're just going back honey
Feel the energy we go through, I told you
Clench your fist like I'm supposed to, I showed you
My view of antisocial is so cool
I refuse to be the victim, my religion is to move
I can't hurt my own skin, the government needs help
What to tell you I will not bend, break or fake the partition
I can't, this is the design of my life, this is me taking mine
This is what I live for, this is me taking yours
This is more than C4, this is what happens when
We are ready to build and destroy, hope you enjoy
It seems like I'm only going back lately
I have my hopes again, oh no, not again
Feel like we're just going back honey
I live my life a rebel, a vigilante, the demons try to attack me
Pedal through this underworld, the gravediggers won't catch me
The system is not a justice system if you ask me
I will tell you that everything is corrupted, do not pass by me
With a condescending look, I can tell you're pretending
Like you my friends and just like a minion I feel ruthless
I feel the tension in the air thick enough to cut it
Or cut you with it, I'm cut from a cloth that spawned a nuisance
Search of their property, I am properly aiming to go against their democracy
The victory of the fight is in my eyes.
The night is young and I can see your passing, I'm waiting for it
You can't ignore it, you live latent, I die huge
Big as the lies you tell, I can tell you that you feel defeated
It seems like I'm only going back lately
Every part of me says forward
Feel like we're just going back honey
I have a bone to collect
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (he's mad!), But I'm not stressed
True friends, a question
Bitch, where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, I got the whole world talking
King Kunta, everyone wants to cut off his legs
Kunta, lossless black man, oh yeah
Bitch, where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, I got the whole world talking
King Kunta, everyone wants to cut off his legs
Yam is the power that
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rappin ', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the hell happened (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't say it, but most of you share bars
As if you had the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something is in the water (Something is in the water)
So I'd rather be a bum than a damn ballet player (oh yeah!)
Bitch, where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, I got the whole world talking
King Kunta, everyone wants to cut off his legs
King Kunta, lossless black man, oh yeah
Bitch, where were you when I was walking?
King Kunta, everyone wants to cut off his legs
Yam got it from Richard Pryor
I was contemplating leaving the stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy and say ... (Oh yeah)
Bitch, where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, I got the whole world talking
King Kunta, lossless black man, oh yeah
Now I run the game, I got the whole world talking
King Kunta, everyone wants to cut off his legs
You're a motherfucker
He was going to kill a couple of rappers, but they did it to themselves
This shit is elemental, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot your identity and bounce left
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put it to my mom and my baby too
Twenty million leaving the court building, woo-woo!
Aw yeah fuck the judge
A little black diaper-headed man with the world behind him
Screaming, "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limousine tinted with gold plates
Directly from below, this is the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a damn king (Oh yeah)
Bitch, where were you when I walked - * shot *
For when you hear the next pop
The funk will be inside you ... * Shot *
King Kunta, everyone wants to cut off his legs

Don't you hear that
Then deaf blood
Moving like a snail
You can catch a slug
I have big drums
Hunt for every dollar
I just stack funds
Yours is insufficient
That's why you're angry, huh?
Ever since I got a deal black people hate me so much
I have no time to waste, money on my mind
Like hair
Like a flight of steps
All a nigga gets is stairs
Looking like a pear
When I get to a club
I'm leaving with a couple
Nigga I don't care

Crash my whip today and catch another tomorrow
* So what's up Jay? *

King of my city, I have to understand how I live
Me without a dollar is like a scholar without intelligence (what is that?)
That doesn't make sense, does it? (mm-mmh)
I'm in a Lamborghini with a Brazilian woman (yeah?)
Suck my dick until she numbs it (damn it)
You fly like an airplane
But I'm more like a kite
Flying over the atmosphere
I can hear the joy of aliens (ha)
Victory is sweet my dear (mm-hmm)
Here is the dear technique (mm-hmm)
And maybe you can duplicate me
It is strange how they can never progress within the process
Of making waste
I guess I'm not yet
Look at everyone with their arms as women rub their triceps
You all are funny to me
You thought I came alone, no
It is the root of all evil, but the need of all people.
Yours is fragile
Weight mines on the Brannon scales
Shit nothing but money
*What are you trying to say?*
Plus fifty plus hundreds
Astronauts float throughout the atmosphere, let the ghetto burb
Get up the sidewalk (what's up, dude!), Smoke a nigga and then dive in
He's the immaculate, verbal killer, strangle your perfect tag for an accent
This is Jesus of Nazareth.
Spitting gold politics into an unknown world
In a low-low cherry with four areas of grass, without branches or seeds
Prestigious when I post insurance across fifty states, below speed
You can corner the bigger crowds, Mosh Pit with a big dick
Screaming bitches ain't shit she gobble gobble for hours I jumped in the shower
I dismantle, I devour, the harder Emcees are softer than clam chowder
No challenger can compete, they are childish and weak, harmful.
Dangerous danger for instrumentals, intertwined with God and Frankenstein.
I'm kurupted!
Give me a hundred G for each ringmaster I kneel down
Truly useless, do you have the juice? I will squeeze you without juice
Been the truth ever since, Snoop and the kennel were fucking ruthless
The bullets to its midsection, Mr. Lethal's injection into a regal higher than church steeples, I swear to God.
Count your letters on a jar, I'm a pterodactyl squad, like forgive me on Terrance Martin in Aston Martin
Cannibal coexisting with the coldest, that means I am the sickest, and Theraflu will not
Every time I kick the evil, explosive, syntagmatic, smoking like the barrel of this technology pointed at your neck
I'm kurupted!
(Look buddy) I'm from C-O-MP-TO-a. Nigga can get it, the little friend tied up and he with it.
At the Avalanche exchange meeting (what a fool!)
Forceful for longer than Rosecrans, I'll catch the devil and then dance slowly
Practice trigonometry, practice my aim on the rooftops eating pastrami sandwiches, you are false
Heartbeats and worthless verses arose. The west coast with a long range kills all of you is Top Dawg, TDE, CPT

Three six fo, a bottle of goose, I'm the truth, could you put your hand on the bible and shoot
I'm Kurupted!
I see many of you being really disrespectful, very comfortable, not recognizing the legends
West Coast Legends, Young Gotti
I pass out like Howard University when I verbally become Hercules hurting these emcees early and urgently clenching my nerves looking for certain certified nouns and verbs on the verge of a vigorous victory. Kurupted
Check, check, check, check, check
Go...
Travel to him, travel to him, because you never know
When a bullet can hit and you die to it, it dies to it
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, cause he's not what you are
For the meaning of life, what is my purpose?
Maybe this Earth is not a good place to be
How far is the sky? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I will die, will you give me receipts?
I wonder if the eyes of the Lord will look at me.
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I am good, I am bad, I am a Christian, I am a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm fair, I'm a murderer
What I'm doing, I say I'm human, now people just
Travel to him, travel to him, because you never know
When a bullet can hit and you die to it, it dies to it
Die to him, die to him, live your life, live it well
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, cause he's not what you are
It goes one (one), two (two), three (three)
Two in the front, one in the back seat (seat), seat (seat), seat (seat), seat (seat)
But why should we retaliate? Is it human nature?
I don't know, then I look for the answers
"Turn right, there they go!"
Travel to him, travel to him, because you never know
Die to him, die to him, live your life, live it well
Don't do it like he did, cause he's not what you are
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
When I open this book and then I burn part of this jacket
My plan is to discover the world and escape all my demons.
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion is inside the heavens
A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to do it right
But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I could jump tonight
Have you ever met a saint who was following the sinner's advice?
When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so attractive to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, treating my morale
Some people look at my face and then tell me not to worry about it
I return that they deposit, without money, only total silence
I'm running, they say I'm crazy, a young man without a guide
There are hundreds of us with problems
More money, more drugs and violence
That's dealing with the hardest life, that's in my life
But regardless of who I am
Travel to him, travel to him, because I never know
When a bullet hits me and I die, I die
Die to him, die to him, live my life, live it well
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, cause he's not who I am
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
Yes, life can please you, but death can bother you
The day Niko had that seizure
I lost one of my biggest believers, aww!
Nearby deaths make you think about your life
As if you had the same opportunity twice, what would you do differently?
I would tell her that I loved her more, do more
But he jokes about her crying in that photo
Now when I'm done recording
I swear, I let the beat beat on your behalf
Have him shake his head in the sky and say, "They do it again."
Make the clouds become speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with your people
I hate that the truth that life chose for them is below me
Sir, what kind of life is this?
"Mom, I just want to sing"
You have to risk everything "
So I'm smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
I love money, I love bitches for lack of better words
I have no time, I have no feelings for the lack of better words
Loud music, I can't hear it playing for lack of better words
You have nothing more to offer than a lack of better words.
Get nothing more from me than a lack of better words
Feeling cheap for being your woman for lack of better words
But I say my ego has to go for lack of better words
I can't love you, I love these streets for lack of better words
But if it's true, would you trust me for better or for worse
I'm selfish, I can't help it, for lack of better words
You're going to be like this forever for lack of better words
You gon 'fix your shit, no, no, you never learn
You can't do better for lack of better words
I can never let you forget it every time you make me nervous
Na, na, na, everything you do, excuse
Na, na, na, everything you do is an excuse
(Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy)
I wish this nigga (uh!)
I wish a nigga
I wish this nigga (yeah!)
I wish your mhm-mhm-mhh
I wish this nigga (uh!)
I wish a nigga
I want a nigga (yeah!)
Trapped in a rock and a hard place [inaudible]
Yeah woah
He's just nice, just cut like a ginsu
Look at the life I went through
We're the last real niggas alive, that's official
The game fell Documentary and made many enemies
It was a classic album, but before that.
Guerilla Black debuted and waxed the city
But that was not my M.O., I just thought he was an asshole
I can't understand why Game would say his name that way.
Many years have passed, there is still no legitimate answer.
Anyway, I took out a mixtape in 12th grade
Minor of the Year Hub City Threat, DJ Dave
Put it on people, people said it was stupid
With the current, I went to the barbershop to show my skills
Mike and Himey and some other cat said it was real
Himey was a game barber, the other cat made a statement
Said I'd play it for him, hoping to get my big break
But I never got an answer ... anyway
This nigga called Pop Gates came to my school with a camera
I was free on your DVD for a minute and then
Hit the streets, they knew me as K. Dot from Compton
Man Hootie was probably the youngest poppin 'out
Until I met Top Dawg, I told Dave that he would like to meet
I in the studio made me freestyle for an hour
He told me to come back tomorrow, but I was back in an hour
Jay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape
At first I was skeptical because I knew where I was staying.
We did our first collaboration on the Nephew track
We started with his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper
Before Sidekicks became a modern phone
At the same time our buzz was generated by G Malone
I had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it
He said that Sony had given him an incredible budget
Now that he's a smart nigga, I'm trying to make my raps bigger than life
But not knowing how to market it well
Turned on the radio
The only new West Coast cat playing was Bishop
And by then this buzz of nigga was tremendous
In the lab, Rock and I try to hone our craft.
But all we had was the instrumental and the hook
But when
He gave it to Julio, just to get his opinion.
The next thing you know is that the registration was
Yarn
That was a good look, it set the coast on fire
Niggas in garden projects presents Watts Riot
So these rappers start hating, calling the station
Ask them why they don't record, what are you blacks complaining about?
The shit was funny to us
Niggas hate to see a nigga coming from below, I
Amidst a single poppin 'and niggas tryna search and destroy
I had a situation with Def Jam, premature
I was glad Jay-Z respected me
As for radio playback, obviously, it has a lot
Fighting Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock talked about it
Which in my opinion, I didn't think shit was important
But that's another story, we got to the lab with Game
And some other names like Juice and Young, boy
The cypher freestyle and everyone said "Wow"
These niggas Top Dawg ‘about to make noise"
Surely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that.
But right after that, we didn't see it anymore
G Malone came with great success with Akon
Mistah FAB fought Royce Nickel with napalm
Then they all start screaming the new west
And they claim that west coast legends don't want to see it at best
I think that's just an excuse, because his music is not tight
Tell them Ab-soul said it, they can quote it twice
So Crooked came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killing the internet
But he was a threat from Deathrow, then Roccett emerged
It finally started to seem like the West was making moves
Western Union had the whole block booming due to Snoop
In fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite of the group
So problem? took off, another Compton native
We're both niggas from Compton, but Compton still hasn't made it
At this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves
We almost got into big meat for Lil 'Wayne
There are certain things that the streets should only know
Yell at Nipsey
It was then that I dropped C4 and the critics got mad at me
Since they didn't see my views, take the most popular album and do it again.
That's a damn stupid power move
You're a fool, you don't know shit about this war shit
There's more shit to want to be the king of the coast.
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, just cut like a ginsu
Look at the life I went through
We're the last real niggas alive, that's official
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, just cut like a ginsu
Look at the life I went through
So two weeks ago I finally ran into black, I also gave him my mixtape
And he said he was a Game partner
He said he didn't like it
But blacks like it
"Look, look, look, look now, I tried to tell him that you were tight"
Nigga probably never gave it to him and shit
Everyone, clap your hands only if they're real
Middle finger up, fuck how they feel
Be yourself, just show me you're real
Middle fingers up
Just let me be me
That's the only way i know
Just let me be me
That's the only way i know how to hold it down
That's the only way i know how to hold it down
I just wanna be me
Without disrespect, but screw you
My education stopped at a high school
But I can outwit any high IQ
Cold my style makes me run my nose
Oh, I look at the mirror and then I realize that the real lies inside me
Some say I'm crazy because I think I need a psychiatrist
Ask too many questions about the stars and shit on Earth.
I'd rather be in the studio than buy drinks
So if I'm not dancing, don't think I'm in shit
But I prefer only 2 steps, like my first steps
yes
Just let me be me
Just let me be me
That's the only way i know
That's the only way i know how to hold it down
And tight jeans are not lick
Still face, play with me like an oompa loompa
Won't you relax like Michael did?
I grew up with killas man, people who killed men
Not a fake person, that's the Sims man
Live my life through some movie, man
I'm not acting shit, I'm packing shows
Because they know they don't know Kendrick for you
And oh
Just let me be me
That's the only way i know
Just let me be me
That's the only way i know
That's the only way i know how to hold it down
That's the only way i know how to hold it down
I almost lost my life to the industry
These tag heads are just shit
I have you with professional killas, chasing successes
Making the records they want, that was destroying my brilliance
My mom said, "Boy, that doesn't sound like you."
I said, "This is the sound, though."
My only excuse
And he kicked it like he was skating, make these motherfuckers hate me
And you may underestimate me, but I know what I'm worth
A diamond in the land of God, a diamond in winter.
Watch the Simpsons and eat cereal for dinner
To make sure you feel me
Just let me be me
That's the only way i know
That's the only way i know how to hold it down
That's the only way i know how to hold it down
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar. What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, is it really you?
Is this who you are? What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
Kendrick Lamar, who are you?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
What are you trying to accomplish Kendrick Lamar?
I think I finally got to the pinnacle
To find myself as an individual
The world is so typical
I used to want to be the rap messiah
In love with becoming a relevant star
I never had that, but I wrote it in my raps to make you mad
Vanity, they say it can harm me
So do I really want it?
If I didn't, I guess I'm a good connected cocaine
Cook in a laboratory, hoping to tell a story.
That everyone can feel, like the ones that came before me
Knowing that I am misunderstood
So I have to express my point like a snitch would
And I would never walk in the shade that was never really there
Or try to fill the shoes with an invisible pair
And Dave said he was proud of my new honesty.
And all I can say is, "Will radio matter to me?"
Yes, or should I say no?
Or should I stop and come with a whole new approach?
You heard my hip-hop when I was 16
Well that was me then, now I'm an adult
But i'm not worried
My talent should take me to places I've never been
The world should spin as soon as my records spin
I wanna be the tallest plus all the shit
Capital punishment, loud police sirens.
Too focused, one word, just
And this is Kendrick Lamar, and they will soon know Cloud 9, already
That means I want to be the tallest
Too focused, one word, just
Too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Too focused, one word
Too focused, too focused, one word
Uh
Yes
Kendrick Lamar
Yeah i can reconcile being depressed really bad
I am a thinker, not a drinker, but I keep dragging Hennessey on;
Alcohol numbs pain like where Novacane stabs
In your arteries, forgive me but my city goes crazy
Via Compton California, places with forensics and karma in em
Colors corresponding to gangs about us
Common Corrupt Crips and Viruses paralyze the city
Triple crime, the Bible and the Koran cannot save it;
Welcome, don't be afraid, your city is similar, right?
Where helicopters hijack the night and the police silence your rights;
Staring at the sky, I wonder will you live to see twenty-five?
I'm twenty-two years old, at twenty I knew I was against it;
This boy named Jonathan was monitoring
His mom and sister, his older cousin, honored him;
For Johnny, it could have been
A modern rider then
Walk outside again, see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a MAC-11 now his eyes are big
Fascinated by chaos, what does your cousin say now?
He wants to be from the neighborhood he is from and that's one
Go crazy, matching shirts that say "The hood made me"
Without love, they only scatter slugs, that is the policy, the leader and the prodigy;
Now shorty doo-wop, holding an oowop, hanging with rah-rahs
With blah blah they sit on the block and fade and lick
Going on missions with lunatics, a ninth degree threat
Banging for six months, smoking like six bangs an hour;
The power to hit, he was walking from ... (shots)
Little Johnny
I think you will find, sir, that there will come a time
Thinking for themselves like other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves.
Then the black man will think like a black man and feel for other black people
And this new thought and feeling will make blacks stick together
And then at that point you will have a situation
Where when you attack a black man, you are attacking all black men
And this kind of black thinking will make all black people stick together
And this kind of thinking will also end the brutality inflicted on black people by (black people)
And it's the only thing that will end it
It is something that the black man has to end.
Wow
I think I must have forgotten or something
As if it wasn't hot or something
Like I don't make your girl take off her top or something
I am like
LOL
LMAO
Laugh at the haters here
I'll be your favorite in years
She wants to play play
But what else can I say?
Jump to the blow and I'm going
I smell money, I don't need cologne
I just need a weirdo
Who can jump on the bone
Like an X-ray technician
My rectangular prism
Say money sex then drugs
How to play blackjack
Imagine this kodak
Moment forever
K. dot that guy
She sucked on my cock and froze
I have a pocket full of checks
With a two-step madman
And diamonds on my neck
Cool ziploc
Hoes want to play play
Goose bottle and I'm leaving
See her let go
The shit we're in
It is the maximum
Dual flow XL
That's the best vibe
As if it could never happen
A test of sobriety
I'm in the club i can manage
Make my view panoramic
I'm off this planet
They don't say K.Dot is here
They say your spaceship has landed
And your access has been granted
Like a kitchen floor
I travel in the shared car because I have two whores
Like Aaliyah alone
DJ Heat, how are you?
Hello, hit every liar clip with an Eggo
Who spent you? Man, I raised the price of petro
Assassination of Cali, gang members and GTA
Grass and water, come and swim in a tidal wave
I'm screwed, psychologically brain dead
I once entered a blood group, wearing all red
I wonder why no one is hitting me
Angry as shit, then the police came
I'm from Compton too, I yell at Game, give me a pair of shoes
Finna skydives at the peak of my career
From the edge of murder, you never heard that, okay
What do you think now? Clip-clip, pow, fallen man
It is so and so and so and a
It is so and so and so and a
You never know, so I'm tied up and I
Give up, give up, give up, give up, hit
Bang bang bang bang bang bang
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Wash, bang, bang, you know what is good, bang, bang
Who said Long Beach doesn't keep it hooded?
Five minutes away, say you can die today if you are speechless
Well, let's just say, if you run your trout
Your fucking fish gets shot in the mouth
And also your bitch gets shot in the mouth
That's ejaculation, you kiss it, then you try it
I walk with my antennas like
Television long before satellite
K Dot mechanisms, learn something
I could say you don't know anything
You're an idiot, I'm gloating and I'm Jim Carrey myself
You better duck, blessed be you, you'll be eating through a tube
I've been fed, that's the kind of shit
I've fed, that's so fucking fly
So where's my parachute? I'm about to jump off Hoover Dam
No car sign, I think I landed in the Hoover, damn
They are about to shoot
It is so and so and so and a
You never know, so I'm tied up and I
Bang bang bang bang bang bang
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Wash, bang, bang, you know what is good, bang, bang
I'm a savage on the east side, black matters bring tragic
Spray worms, fly for practice
It's a habit to laugh at you bitch niggas get down on my level
Heavy metal when I'm rocking in my jeans
Leave your captor to act like he wants the drama
Grab the flame, she's the baddest mom
Disrespectful house, blame the hood I come from
Catch me walking with a little
I'm doubly hot, I'm walking with heat that's in the sun
Your blood explodes, you have if you don't have one
Before you know it, you're close to showing
Down for count as an accountant
California, what do you know about it?
Yeah i'm about that about it
Like teacher Pete, I am the streets
Jay rock
It is so and so and so and a
It is so and so and so and a
The murderous niggas from Cali don't know how to act and I
You never know, so I'm tied up and I
Give up, give up, give up, give up, hit
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Uh, yell at ScHoolboy Q
He's uglier than a motherfucker (laughs)
Tire marks, tire marks
Finish line with tire marks
When the relay begins, I'm a runaway slave
Ugh, walk on water and run on waves
God MC oh my gosh you gotta see
There's never a me in me
From an Odyssey, I'm a block away
The fire marshal is moving
Marshmallows inside my pen
Sweet sixteens
I have a sweet sixteen and they are more deadly than sin
I am so horrified
With the prototype with a pious protocol.
I hurt you on camera in Compton in Canada
I don't care where you are
Just blink twice and I'm there where you are
In an ocean full of sharks about to fall short
Water in the pot, flow crack rock like Bam Bam nigga
Have two grams of nigga pay or blam blam nigga
He had a black Camry, a Dipset with bumps, a black Killa Cam
I'd been close to niggas, killas, pimps
You ain't been close to shit, but your mom and your bitch
Uncle Bobby got the house broken into at 9-6
Kick in the door
K9s all in the kitchen before I heard about Mike Vick
Mom in the bathroom poppa at work
It happened on Sunday that we should have gone to church
Look at my shirt, polo in it
Will be sold if my logo is on it
I am not afraid of any opponent
A demon approaches and could throw a spear into the omen
You are looking at the Romans 2010
Empire, Hiiipower HP, in your face like HD
And I spat like an HK
They shot me like an H3, H-U-B-C-I-T-Y, A-B and Y-G
Trouble and hootie nigga
Tell the government to come shoot me, nigga
And a fist full of money gives it to the fifth grade
Drink a fifth of Hennessy and then take another fade
With a democratic politician from CA
They don't want to see a B-L-A-C-K
Scratch like a Hall of Fame DJ
Give us some free J, put us on PJ
Now we're in the county jail asking for a triple
Damn you are cold
Black man tell me where your damn heart goes
Although I am in the land of milk and honey.
No one ever cared when I got my first chain
Take it back and shit
And you rap niggas looking funny, try to answer and shit
As if he returned that shit
Acting like you're real or something
Nigga hasn't busted any steel, hasn't busted any necklace
Go take some pills or something
With your BM inside and your box glove
And the medicine that a doctor gave a nigger won't help
I'm on the edge where I'm amazing
I bet I hit it where they kill all the rappers like
Blah blah blah blah where's the knife?
Cut, cut, cut, where is your life?
Your careers are over, he collapsed
And if I'm out of rhythm, I know I'm not sober
That's a new flow
New dough for the new year and sumo in a rap buddy
I'm not a rapper, I'm a raptor
That's a V-neck T-Rex for the rapture
I'm a factor and your facial
I will fracture into a fraction
Not half and i hate math
The pastor is like Eddie Long, fucking fagot
It took me a long time to get here
Nigga, fuck!
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yes I know
A minute has passed
Have to know
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
When you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
When you need me
Yes you need me (Woooh!)
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation boy
Don't argue with us
Wonderful rhythm pickers, novel authors and spitters
And everything is for literature.
I promise I will never leave you, ah yeah
My life is like twelve open note microphones without hope
As soon as the flow becomes pleasant
The poltergeist that scares the masters of ceremonies
My prototype for each
My share of Gd's and R.I.P
She knows my type of style is like my everything
Apparently my appetite remains hungry
Don't bite any hand that feeds
The culture vulture dies and bleeds
My focus holds these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen (look over your shoulder)
Spending my time and mind seems
It's supposed to shine, remember I'm king
The pros are the cons, the diamond rings
Advance time but i will bring
The divine soul and crossed between
What is yours and mine? Gold, green.
That grabbed Shakur and by the wing
And it flies before my vocal scream!
For hip-hop, check out my Ziploc bag full of goodies
You Chris Rock
Hit the pookie and the pit stops
When they fuck you up
It's love i know you
Don't you know baby?
Don't you know baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
When you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
When you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yes, yes, you need me (Woooh!)
Shhh, look over your shoulder, do you understand me?
Niggas are afraid to rap with me
Burn until I've been anointed
One of the kings of black history.
And yes, I see that the game is a little different.
Blacks simply lack
And bars and I spit them out like darts
Until your kidney is punctured
Trash and no matter how hard you try to convince me
And you're going to make my gun shoot into your hole at night
Yes ohh
I am the Buddha, the Ali Baba, the creator
So pristine, the dice roll under my sleeve when I shake them
So rude, I'm so cold but I'm what you need to wake them up
While the crowns and medals on the wall wait for me to take them
When I arrive, my theme song, I have to play it
And when I go even my shadow has a sound
Because I am the god, the hardest, the martyr, the father
Completing the saga while we meet and greet
And beating your niggas completely
Conquer, bark extremely at a black
You see me, you deeply divide a black, believe me
But, Kenny, you grew up (you pity me)
Now give me the startup
So sweet when I spit
The sky is deep, it was deep
I was asleep, now the guard is up, hmm
Defend the fundamentals
While most of you boast about rent
Focus on what is most essential.
Do I have your attention?
As I applaud these blows like thunder
Look over your shoulder boy and ask yourself
Don't you know baby? (Mhm, mhn, yes)
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Just look over your shoulders!
Yes, yes, you need me (Woooh!)
With God taking care of us
And I on your shoulders
(All you had to do is look forward)
But what are you going to do?
You get even closer to the devil
Those clowns you hang out with
More ridiculous than white Cleopatra
Or Caucasians telling blacks to go back to Africa
But I'm rambling, you're more, but you act less
Why do you act less?
Still, when the weight of life feels like a rock
(Just look over your shoulders)
I'm here when you need me
When you need me
When you need me
When you need me
Don't you know baby?
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
When you need me
Just look over your shoulders!
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Yes, yes, you need me (Wooh!)
(Wooh!)
Don't you know baby
Don't you know baby
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
When you need me
When you need me
Just look over your shoulders, honey!
Damn all of us
Give me a run for my money

If I made up my mind at work, would you still love me?

Feeling like Tyson with it
Leave it twice, I'm on it
Only at night, I'm joking
Just for life, yeah, just for life, yeah
Only for life, we will get it
Hit that thin shoulder
I know what's coming over me
Overseas back
At ten o'clock, all the money comes in
If I didn't ride the blade on the sidewalk, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me to love me

I told you I'm on my way (love me)
I'm on the way, I know the connection is lazy
Pick up the phone for me, darling
Damn, we're jammin '
Bad attitude from your babysitter
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to try it
I told you i'm on my way
If I didn't ride the blade on the sidewalk, would you still love me?
If I downplayed my net worth, would you still love me?
Keep it a hundred, I'd rather you trust me to love me

Love me just love me
I have a ball for my dead friends
I count this bread for my dead friends
Smoking dodo at your mom's house
She leaves work early, insults us and kicks us out.
Popping wheelies in aqueducts in the summer
Stealing a whistle from minibikes when González was coming
And I remember Shaniqua gave you a cold shoulder
Says he ain't fucking with niggas singing on Boost Mobiles
I'm laughing at you and praying that the helicopters don't catch you (never catch me, never
Never catch me, never
Never catch me, never)
We drop the third period just to screw up your school
We know where you're from, uniforms can't fool us
Throw it as you proposed
Cornrows with the zags in the middle
FUBU platinum jeans, elastic wrapped around the denim
Memory...
(Ooh, I remember)
I can feel when you're around
I return the favor when I'm on stage
And then I have to say this
How I laugh, now I'm crying, I miss you (I miss you)
How I fought you, hugged you, I remember (Oh, I remember)
You are forever my friend, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking about my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo-woo-woo-woo
(Woo-woo-woo-woo)
Poppin 'trophies, by the mall
Pat Dawg that's my cousin, I love him too
Wishing we could turn around, patrolling the grass
Tam's hamburger for breakfast, fries on my shirt
Grandma said, "We go to church, how often do we listen?"
Aw man, I have weight on my shoulder
Aw man, I have
Aw man, I have so many angels to feed
Look at the skies, they depend on me
These staff, I hope you know my loyalty
Will always run deep
So i put it twice
Put my candle on the street
Put my faith where you are
Gone, but you are not forgotten
I fought with you, I hugged you, I remember (Ooh, I remember)
I love it even if I don't get bigger
You are forever my friend, my nigga
I'm in this club thinking about my boys
As I cry tears of joy like
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo-woo
Woo-woo-woo-woo
You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)
You can have the world and you still need help (I am)
You survive the world, if your heart is real (I am)
You can't change the world if you can't change yourself (I am)
You can please the world, but not God himself (I am)
You can have the world and you still need help (I am)
You survive the world, if your heart is real (I am)
I said I'm angry and I'm excited (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is to just get high (high, high, high)
Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (Die for)
Ooh, that good pussy is to die for (On fire)
It is a secret society
All we ask for is trust (All we ask for is trust)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Kung fu kenny now
A better way to make a wave, stop defending them
I meditate and moderate all my victories again
I'm always on your mind
I put my letter and my lifeline on the line
And there's no limit when it could shine, it could grind
You're shooting with him at the right time, right now
(Only for the dollar sign)
Bad girl RiRi now
Turn, turn, turn, turn, put it down now
On your pulse like it's EDM
Gas in the bitch like it's premium
Transport the ass to a bitch in the fast lane
Run the atlas, I'm natural, I'm fine
I'm a savage, I'm a jerk, I'm a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (yeah)
I've been down so long lost hope
I did it so hard that I slowed down
Honestly forever, all a real nigga wants
All I want tonight is just get high (Yeah)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Feel something wrong
You act suspiciously, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Tell me who you are loyal
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it grass? Is it drink?
Does it come down with the strong pipes in the rain?
Big chillin ', just for the power in your name
Tell me who you are loyal
Is it love for the streets when the lights go dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari does not start?
Tell me when your loyalty comes from the heart
Tell me who you are loyal
Does it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Does it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself beforehand?
I said, tell me who you're loyal to
Is it someone you would lie about?
That's what God is for
I said I'm angry and I'm excited (fired, fire)
All I want tonight is just get high (Yeah)
All I want is, all I want is
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Feel something wrong
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
It is very difficult to be humble
It's so hard to be
God knows I'm trying
Yes that's great
Thirty-two shots in the clip of his thirty-four, a little black man with a heart
Frustrated to be broke while climbing the charts
Penitentiary changing and dancing with suicide
Homie, I have love for him
Angel in angel powder, used to throw for him
It took me on my first mission, transition
Good boy turned rapper, pay attention
This is deeper than you think
We dismissed it as a joke when we saw her leave the stage
With all your favorite accessories
Those are especially the big budget videos
Just a shadow in the dark, mingling with all the friends in the industry
So I guess this is where the story begins, J Amazing, what!
I need some water, something came over me
Too close to comfort, as blood runs through my favorite vein
Beats racing like a junkie, I just need you to love me
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl, respect the cat
I promise just a touch, let me put my head
If it's okay, she said, "It's okay"
Yeah i need everyone's fucking hands right now
I need all the motherfuckers
Door and its Nike Air rattles
Take on the fire escape, no time for battles
There's that new shit
This new, new shit
Wake up in the morning, thinking about money, kick your feet
Go hit you lick, fuck off with a bitch
Don't go to work today, cut yourself well
Door and its Nike Air rattles
Take on the fire escape, no time for battles
Well i never expected
Watch yourself a comedy, stay!
Watch yourself a comedy, fuck off, then roll up some weed
Go lick, fuck you with a bitch, don't go to work today
Drink some grease, go get a gun, shoot out the window
Bet on your favorite team, play a little Madden
Go to your mom's club or house
Whatever you do, just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the morning, thinking about money, kick your feet
Touch yourself, call your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get a visa, make you pay the rent
Get on the Gram, flex the bitches who hate you
Make yourself a pill, call your bitches, make them wait for you
Go to the club, have fun, make that ass bounce
Whatever it is, just make it count
I need some water, something came over me
Too much heat to simmer could also overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood runs through my favorite vein
Am I asking too much? Let me put my head inside
I promise just a touch, let me put my head
Both in a trance, the feelings are dead, what a quick life!
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
I did this before, I promised myself that I would arrive an hour earlier
Get on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take a nap and do it again
We all wake up, try to tune into the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping that the elections were not true
All of us worried, all buried and our deep feelings
None of us married to his proposal, makes us feel cheap
Still and sad, anguished and angry, tell the neighbor
I bet you agree, parade the streets with your voice with pride
Going back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust
Lately, I feel like I've been grieved for fame
Lately, we want the same shame routine
Lately, lately, lately, my lust has increased (Lately)
Lately, everything is contradiction
Lately i'm not here
Lately, I want
Lately, in James 4: 4 it says
Friend of the world is enemy of the lord
Get ready, lust is all yours
Too much heat to simmer could also overheat
Too close to comfort, as blood runs through my favorite vein
Beats racing like a junkie, I just need you to love me
Ooh, I don't want more than that, girl, respect the cat
I promise just a touch, let me put my head
If it's okay, she said, "It's okay"
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5
When I kick it, I kick it like the beat is my enemy
Paying a picture like duderline, you're not shit, but do it
In the city where you see me pointed, damn
You can hide, you get it if you want
I make karate moves, but the crushing tiger could be destroyed by a writer
Yes, the passenger jumped
There is a murderer like everywhere
So why would you take him there?
The neighborhood terrorist got terror when these people got scared
That is why my intelligence tells me to stay with a banker.
Tell me f * ck you I'll tell you f * ck back with my index finger
I can flip some murderous shit, but I'd rather stay calm
Keep it sober, try not to be a p ** s and like you
Nigga that cold attack of kale, Cali on my back until my torso breaks black
This is where that is gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5
I'm so malicious that I exploit your wicked
Make them close like Stygians, hell of a kitchen I'm blowing dishes
I'll lift it up, my flow is a gift
She fries the paper of wealth with a bow and ribbon
I am flying and listening to my car, why with a broken mission?
They are so suspicious, short and vicious without convictions
The juries who make their own decisions want us to go to prison
Call the adrenaline, I have this soul like a living poe
And since I'm coexistent to the ban
I'm a clothing critic who says these widows are the best when they spit on them
Mother of Statistics Rap with Metaphysics
And yes, simplistic, they are left out as a repetition
Show a little appreciation, keep your pessimistic .my
Better than ever, Papoose is the definition
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5

If Pirus and Crips got along
They would probably kill me at the end of this song
It seems that the whole city is against me
Every time I'm on the street, I hear ...
Man, where are you from, nigga?
Fuck who do you know, where are you from, my nigga?
Where does your grandmother stay? My nigga?
Get ready, I'll take you on a journey down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm throwing crack or moving cocaine
This is a dead end and a lot of cognac and intense pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress on your brain
It was me, L Boog and Yan Yan, YG Lucky we traveled through Rosecrans
He got ugly, waving his hand out the window, check it out!
Warriors and Conans, I hope the euphoria can dance slowly
With society, the driver's seat is the first to be killed.
Seen a fair-skinned black with a brain burst
At the same hamburger stand where * beep * hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying it did
But since that day, I was looking at it differently
That was when he was nine, Joey packed all nine.
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
With the sliding door, what happens?
Fuck you shooting because if you're not walking, damn punk?
Picking up the damn bomb, picking up fools
Suck a dick or die or suck blow
That's what mom said when we were eating that free lunch
Aw man, damn it, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin in '94, fuck your truce!
Now drag your head into that knot
You end up dead in the news
Not a peace treaty, just pack BG to pre-approve
Bodies in the upper part of the bodies, IV in the upper part of the IV
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
When you get into that car make sure your color is correct
Make sure you are corporate or they will call your mother to collect
When we're in traffic and it's tragic, that shit ain't no threat
You move backwards if you suggest you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a helicopter and have a speed dial doctor I guess
M.A.A.d. city
Man, where are you from, nigga?
Fuck who do you know, where are you from, my nigga?
Where does your grandmother stay? My nigga?
If Pirus and Crips got along
They would probably kill me at the end of this song
It seems that the whole city is against me
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Wake up, you idiot!
It's nothing more than a Compton thang
G-yes, very simple and simple
Let me teach you some lessons on the street
(Smoke something, nigga!)
Hood ('Sup, Cuz?)
It's nothing more than a Compton thang
G-yes, how do we do it?
Fresh out of school because I was a high school graduate
Sleeping in the living room on my mom's pillow
Reality hit, I saw the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas jumped on foot and lunged
My friends said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up going
To organize a robbery on the third Saturday, I entered
Cocaine mixed with marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if his first forceful blow foamed you in the mouth
You know the reasons but you will never know my life
Niggas has been mixing shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, rear nudes
Dive in, do a black turn
Cluck heads up and down the block and shit
Once it's crooked and shit
Block a nigga
Lark, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the neighborhood, loc, yeah, that's great
Shit, the hood sank me so I follow the rules
But yes, that's how I am, I grew up in the neighborhood where they beat
And the blacks that represent colors are doing the same
Pass it to the left so you can smoke on me
A couple of passes on the hood lately, shit
A couple of IVs with the fucking spray can
Shooting in the crowd, then they all ran
Crew, I'm going to kill, the street life I long for
Shooting hits the enemy, hearts become brave
Fit, regulators on the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we're still in the hood
Deal with the result, a strap in hand
And a bird and ten big ones where a mothafucka is found
If I told you I killed a black man at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceiving me as innocent Kendrick you saw on the street
With a basketball and something from Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
And it's safe to say that our next generation may be able to sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of a boy with a helicopter holding the hostage from the dead end
Kill them all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, vandalizing the option
From living a lie, choking your body with toxins
Hit the dust, then look at this flame that reaches his eyes
Listen, you coward, the concept is point and then hit and slide
Out with that bitch with a deposit, a price on her head, tithes
I probably go to projects, I
Lives within the womb of the rough, Compton, USA. USA
Made me an angel in Angel Dust, what?
City of M.A.A.d
Compton
Nigga, pass me the bottle, damn it!
You're not the one who got screwed
What do you have it for?
Nigga, that's not a word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, are you alright, my nigga?
Don't even stumble
Just lie down and drink that
Reporting live
Compton, California
Have you ever felt like you never have a life?
Since you never did well, like a black sheep?
Step back, step back your dreams like a bad dream
Chasing the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh, what a cold world for a bankrupt black, it's bitter
I hit a lot of pain, I let him know I wasn't playing
I was as honest as Nas's first name, in Belly
They tell me that it is very difficult to see 25
And if I survive, it's probably with a celly
My chances are low because my dark complexion floats
In the ghetto rather in heels like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I go out
Filling Bankrupt D-Boys Gaps Selling Marijuana
BB King or Snoop's neighbors, that's why I'm
In the club like fucking, although
They say it's just a life, life, life
And if you say that I can't live comfortably
I'll tell you it's a lie, a lie, a lie
So as I hold this Ciroc bottle with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the same day that happened
We are, we are (fine)
We are, we are (true)
Through, through barbs (cables)
We will, we will go through
So as I hold this Ciroc bottle with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the same day that happened
Through the barbed wire
Have you ever felt like you never have a life?
Since you never did well, like a black sheep?
Barbed wire has a barricade at your destination, she desperately
I need some inspiration, look what people are saying
She will have a baby and then run away from her education
At the age of 16, credit card scam schemes
She will never pass, not how, no way
State-owned welfare beneficiary
Housing, Section 8, prostitute from the corner store
The owner is about to prosecute, the blacks tell him that he is cute
Trash hoodrat, six baby daddies
And this baby daddy is new to the family
Relaxing in pajamas, waiting for the first
Fast forward spilling drinks on her fur, that's why she
In the club like fucking, although
They say it's just a life, life, life
And if you say you can't live comfortably
She will tell you it's a lie, a lie, a lie
So while she's in the VIP pouring Merlot into the glass
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are (fine)
We will, we will go through
So while she's in the VIP pouring Merlot into the glass
Celebrate the same day that she passes
Through the barbed wire
Have you ever felt that you finally have life?
Are you finally right? It is no longer a black sheep
In the front seat of a convertible running away to get married
What a feeling to beat the odds
It's like we just got to the lottery my gosh
There must be a God, because God
You have finished the fight while you dispute Ali
Now your lifestyle is looking up and you ran away from crooked handcuffs
And you don't have to kill a nigga just to win a couple bucks
And she doesn't have to go and fuck everyone for a dollar
And they are both constantly working, doing it legally
Just try to make a decent payment every second of the day
But they won't give you credit, they say they say
You must have joined the Illuminati just to get out
In the club like fucking, although
They say it's just a life, life, life
They went to tell you it's a lie, a lie, a lie
So even if you overcame doubt and living isn't bad
Know it's a barbed wire that's always on your way
Through the barbed wire (just laugh)
So everyone says ...
Because they won't catch me again
And I am here to stop trends.
You can catch me if you try
Disappear in the night
And I left
So you passed all the barbed wires?
One more left * Shot *
Two masters of ceremonies, that's all we need
This is a freestyle top, proceed
I come from the west
You know I have to get them
Yes-ugh
As we swing from the top
You know i have the shot sure
If you want to see me all say hello!
Me, give me back that damn microphone
I'll put your little ass on the chair
As you don't see before
Never a better presenter who's fucking shorter than me
I'm-ma use that microphone
I am doing that well
I'm spitting this out all day and all night
Does anyone want to be under pressure?
I love you from here to there, you have the head of the future
Rocky, good boy, crazy city (good boy, M.A.A.D. city)
I was there, ah
Now I had to change it and get the braids
Now it had to happen
Flow sicker than AIDS
I have to make it happen, I have to be real
I have to be proof, I have to be you
It must be us and it must be due
A step forward, master of ceremonies
If you want time right now
Come right now
And it shines! (x6)
To hold!
I have to go with at least some bars
It's not about the women, the money, the stars, and the cars.
It's not about the clothes, the hoes
Know who we are
It's about the mindset.
Love making chords
Your life makes you bruise and mistreat
But that does not matter
If you want to know
Fuck all that chatter
Do your thing let them sing
Let the gunslinger reign
What happens!
Itchy finger shot
To annoy one of you niggas
I'm challenging one of you niggas to jump
I'm going to take out a gun to whip you
Then I put you back in the trunk
The front page of the newspaper.
They say I'm seeing more paper ... right
But only if you knew that
I was at your house right now, taking your paper off
Chick sways on his dick like a fucking bat
I'm going hard, tires bigger than the fucking car
Baby, why the hell do you have tires?
I don't know, just go in
I fold the dough like a notebook
I see money, you spend it like Magic Johnson without looking
Who the hell taught black people to cook?
That's what i hear in your song
Beat said if you're cooking the product and your doll doesn't hurt when you do, then you're doing it wrong (fucking offer)
I used to want to be like Michael Jordan
I guess I would get to the NBA and make a fortune
Uh, every time I'm in my town, I'm acting like my shit doesn't suck
I used to clean my Rolie chain with rubbing alcohol in the sink
Traveling with niggas I grew up with from McNair
Hitting me against the world: hello world Kendrick here
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's how it goes
Michael Jordan
Bounce-bounce ho, bounce-bounce
This shit makes a nigga want to get some bread or pop a head
Or fuck my enemy's bitch, act bad and get rich
Stop at these 26, I'm a slave to vanity
I am a sinner, Jesus Christ, please forgive me for my ways
I don't know why your bitch wants to fuck me
And I don't know why you fucking niggas can't see
I am a representative of the city of Comp, a concrete turner
A.K. To that nigger, don't do it!
And I don't know why you fucking niggas can't see
I'm showing up now, every two hours the paparazzi come
You're kidding, let her be a ho, why are you stopping?
We are stopping traffic, what do you know about those hockey pucks?
I have seen many of you getting money, I know my turn is coming
I don't know why your bitch wants to fuck me
I don't know why (hey wait a minute motherfucker)
Every time I'm in my town, I feel like my shit doesn't suck
I used to clean my Rollie chain with rubbing alcohol in the sink
Ridin '' hang around niggas I grew up with since McNair
Bumpin '"Me Against the World", hello, world, Kendrick here
And I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's how it goes
Michael Jordan Bitch, Michael Jordan Bitch, Michael Jordan Bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I'm too much for these niggas
I'm three a lot for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's how it goes
The only thing I did wrong was make it possible
I did BOP and I made them pop titties
Coming out of Fred Segal, put my girl on it
So fat ass, you probably feel the world in it (Yeah)
Crazy pussy, crazy pussy
Man I know I can't tell you about the friend world
Her crazy pussy, her crazy pussy, I fuck black, I know you hate me
I know they pay too much attention to me
Bring my name, you have to mention it
I need a motor that goes very fast
Call it hall of fame once you drag your ass
Give me a tall glass, coco Cîroc
Please no fizzy, I do my solo pop
Life is a bitch, her crazy pussy
Every time I'm in my town, I feel like my shit doesn't suck
I used to clean my Rolie chain with rubbing alcohol in the sink
Traveling with niggas I grew up with from McNair
Bumpin '"Me Against the World", hello, world, Kendrick here
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's how it goes
Michael Jordan Bitch, Michael Jordan Bitch, Michael Jordan Bitch
Michael Jordan bitch, that means I'm too much for these niggas
Like my glock, don't think
Grandmother in the kitchen, neck bones in the sink.
I don't know why your bitch wants to fuck me
And I don't know why you fools can't see
I'm from the Hoover man, tall like Superman, shit Lois Lane
Your pussy man with the pussy game, shit, we take off the chain
We're exploiting fortune, not fame, shit, you backwards, man
You're chasing hoes, we replace them, pack them up and pass hoes to them
We fuck her houses, we fuck her and we send her home, strong marijuana
You know I'm gone, ignite my arrogance, am I bloated enough?
My long role, yeah, you were left alone, they don't fuck you
Leaning from the Actavis, going blunt again and again
He said Mary was going, so we went round and round
Your bitch texted me, she wants it now, so I had to take her down
I hurt her bouncing off my balls, throwing my cock out of my mouth
You let it go, I hit home runs, I cleaned his shelter until I was done
I can be his number two and you can be his number one
Her pussy is crazy, her pussy is crazy, you fuck niggas
Uh, every time I'm in my town, I'm acting like my shit doesn't suck
I used to clean my Rolie chain with rubbing alcohol in the sink
Traveling with niggas I grew up with from McNair
Bumpin '"Me Against the World", hello, world, Kendrick here
And I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
I'm too much for these niggas, I'm three for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's how it goes
Michael Jordan Bitch, Michael Jordan Bitch, Michael Jordan Bitch
I'm three a lot for these hoes
Wayne told me that and that's how it goes
All studies
Cut the lights
Persuasive invasion, which could cost us our lives.
Looking through the mist, yeah, my head in the night
Audio cardio, jog your brain
Look at God and he calls me
Baby you understand me now
Don't you know that nobody alive can always be an angel?
Oh lord please don't let them misunderstand me
As soon as the beat drops
My flow is sweeter than strawberries, oranges, and apricots.
Damn, I raised the standards of the status quo
We are sexing, I am a nymphomaniac
For the instrumentals, okay, I admit it.
I actually have a hot date tonight, real rap
Prepare me is kerosene struck by lightning
You look at me and then you look at me
And what that means is that this human being is a fly, don't try to duplicate
I'm authentic, I see you looking at my style as a forensic, that's disgusting
Tech! Leave them for the banks
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let them misunderstand me
I see the future better than your computers
Rugers on my hip, finish off all intruders
Shoulda 'coulda' knew he was a murderer
Burning the sun, the rapture
God has returned, they said he would come, but I came faster
I am not an actor, if you play Denzel, you will be thrown through a windshield
The nine is simply portable, the AK is practical
Now on the battlefield I can land in a thousand mines and not explode because I am the bomb
Inside your CD player, bend down to protect yourself, protect your neck, I demand respect
If I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas under control
Preach Tabernacle seek the Holy Bible if I'm lying
King of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my tunnel of vision
Since I don't need to stray, my producer name is Soundwave and he beats me by the batch.
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
My cold flow, like Aspen
I love showing off when I'm in that Aston
A nigga on the east side where I can make you explode
A hundred rounds nigga stop that
This is lyrical murder, not rap
So don't get it wrong
Say my name on your bars, shit, I'm in your neighborhood
Speak out loud, no bite, you niggas are pus
I'm out of that bubble, thinking about life
Or how to make a mill and spend it all in one night
For the top catalog of dogs, that means everyone
Multiple bodies in the shoty eight rappers don't
Damn I hate rappers don't call me that
If you call it what you saw it, you would call me real rap
I don't make shit, all I do is keep it real
Eat, sleep and take shit, clean me if you want
Wait, big truck, lurking with the monster grill
Four-fifths hit me like Emmett Till
Put me in my g mode by schooling every hard head
Tell them about the g-code, like Eskimos
My arms froze, paddle
Watching the game, I'm so official
Oh shit! I need that
I need you sloppy, you sloppy
Yeah that sloppy
This feeling is unmatched
This feeling comes to you thanks to adrenaline and good rap
We don't share the same synonym, go back (west, west, west)
I've been before the internet had new acts
Imitating the nemesis on the radio woke me up
My limited innocence, the experience lacked
Ten of us without a tentative tactic that broke
The mind of a literate writer, but in fact I did
You admitted it once I shipped it wrapped in plastic
Remember to write diligent scratchlin and scratchin sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle ciphers for your reaction
Now I can live in a stadium, pack it faster
Gamblin 'Benjamin benefits, sinning in traffic
Spinnin 'women in cartwheels, linen fabric in fashion
Win in every decision
Kendrick is the master who mastered it
Thank goodness for rap, I'd say he got me a badge
But what is better than that?
The fact that you brought me back home
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
I know everything, I know myself
I know doom could haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
Be a street shit, be a conscious shit
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertising, your sponsors.
Be wise, be bad religion, be good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money.
Be loyalty, be respect, be those who are fools
I know that if I'm generous of heart, I don't need recognition
The way that I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line is for the Compton School District
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I know how much it is worth
Until I realized I didn't know shit
The day i got home
We've been waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Afro diaper, gap in your smile
Sneakers bouncing off the crowd
Throwing soccer balls with his ashen black ankles
Breaking new laws that mom passed at home training
You just forgot about what the public schools had painted
Oh, I forgot, 'Don't kill my environment', it's true, you're famous
I used to watch on channel 5, the television was taken
But it doesn't matter, you're here right now, don't mistake it
It's just a new journey, take a look at your family's ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was shit
I know your life is full of confusion
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can try to enlighten you without scaring you
But if you choose the destination before resting in peace
So be an advocate, especially tell your friends
To come back home "
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
I've been looking for you all my life, an appetite
Is it in a woman, in money or in humanity?
You make me want to jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about love
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let's talk about love
I've been looking for you all my life, an appetite
Is it in a woman, in money or in humanity?
Tell me something, think I'm going crazy, ah!
I say, where are you? Front to back
I'm looking for you, I react only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 Special
Maybe you're on a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the rich know how you feel
I can preach for you if you tell me what's the problem
The invasion of the house was persuasive (it was persuasive)
Nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish)
Dreams of living life like rappers do (like rappers do)
When condom wrappers weren't great (they weren't great)
I took Sherane and went to tell my brothers (Tell my brothers)
Then came Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" ("Let Burn")
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (Ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs)
You look like an easy idea, ya bish (Ya bish)
A silver spoon that I know you're coming from, ya bish (Ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle we never knew (we never knew)
Go to a reverend for income
Go Halle Berry or Hallelujah
Choose your poison, tell me what are you doing
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I've been in a rush all day
This way, that way
Through canals and alleys, just to say
Money Trees is the perfect place for shade
And this is how I feel
This is how I feel, no
A dollar could say fuck the niggas you came with
This is how I feel, no, no
A dollar could make that lane change
This is how I feel, no
A dollar can turn into a million and we are all rich

Two bullets in my uncle Tony's head (my Tony's head)
Said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (Ya bish)
That Louis Burgers will never be the same (It will not be the same)
A Louis belt will never ease that pain (it won't ease that pain)
But I'll buy when that day is shaking (That day is shaking)
Take off at Church's, with Pirellis skirting (Pirellis skirting)
Hoping everyone offends you, ya bish (Ya bish)
And we're going to crash it when no one is home

Do you love one of you bucket-head hoes? No way!
Where the niggas pick up your pockets
Santa Claus don't lose them stockings
Spirits spilling, guns busting
No turkey on Thanksgiving
My house boy just tamed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgives him
When do you eat government cheese?
I have to support my daughter n'em
Get out of my way, bish
I have that drum and I have bands for them
Like a parade, Bish
Leave that job in the bushes
I hope the children don't see my hiding place
This is the last time you can see my butt
From the gardens where the grass is not cut
Snakes stalk, Blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs
Unfulfilled promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time is it
Take your J's and tell him to kick him where a FootLocker is
Dream of me shaded under a money tree
Go Halle Berry or Hallelujah
Everyone will respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

Nigga, tell the world that I'm Compton, Compton
Nigga, I'm Compton
Big ass condom, mothafuck already trouble
I want you to suck my whole band after the concert
Compton, Compton
Big ass condom, mothafuck already trouble
I'm killing every instrument and I sign them
And there are no 360 offers, look that's upfront at McDonald’s
I spark like a wino
Over and over again, I often wonder where the time will go, my mom and dad know
I trample a rapper like a Kappa or hit him like a Congo
Then speed up in a Bronco, OJ
Back then we wore LA Gears with rhinestones
Today I come headlong like a rhino
Rhyme like I made it up, my pun is limitless
Now nigga turn my vinyl, the club goes crazy
Rap like I ain't eaten shit, shit on any list
And we never agree to your singing, King K
POINT. is E.T.A. Primetime, new clothes
Bitch I think I'm 2Pac
Bitch I think I'm B.I.G
Bitch I think I'm Eazy-E, I'm Big L and I'm ODB
And OMG could OD yeah, that's my new tape
That's a thank you ribbon, thanks for knowing that I'm great
Middle finger to fake ... Fuck you!
I'm the center of attention Hut 1, Hut 2
And my bitch is also a stray dog, mixed with all kinds of shit
I got them all hype and shit, I don't even do anything
Screaming "fuck the world", I tell you when I'm crazy
Compton, Compton
Big ass condom, motherfucking, mom!
I go into the study and a suicide bomber bombs you.
I bomb Obama if that nigga gets in my way
I'm smelling a little vagina, ya niggas a little clit
He must be dead already, saying I'm not killing him
I'm in the lead and I win, feeling like a double
Already speaking Illuminati, I am speaking eliminating
Everyone, including Satan, the Lord knows that heaven awaits
I'm the best rapper alive!
I'm the best rapper alive!
I'm the best rapper alive!
Tell Wayne to swallow his pride
Ya niggas talking that jive
I'm talking about Malcolm X
Martin Luther rushes through your fucking set of shit
I'm the best rapper alive!
I'm the best rapper alive!
I'm the best rapper alive!
The Jigga man should have retired
I'm going after Kanye, Lupe Fiasco and Nas
Snoop Dogg and mister Andre, Eminem, Busta Buss Rhymes
You better not burst more rhymes
I'm starting to break your ass
You will not be action, you will not pass
Let's start busting niggas
Choppers be bustin ’on niggas?
Chopper be bustin 'in niggas!
I'm doing this for soul-o
TDE what is the logo
Yes she knows all my tape
I'll make a nasty movie and make sure the tapes
You are absolutely right, I have a big appetite with a big tapeworm every day that I crave another food, I am very gray
Give my ho-mays a little
I got this ignorant shit, from my uncle Tony
And may my nigga rest in peace
From heaven I know you see I'm Compton, Compton
Nigga, I'm Compton
A great condom, mothafuck LAPD, DA, and his honor were infused in Lark
Catch my body, set my mind free
Hoping you can see the sign
I feel like
I feel like
But it's my day
And sometimes shit has to go my way
Niggas got me fucked up
Top dawg and we're all stars like we're chucks
But it doesn't matter
Take a trip to outer space to show you where my mind is
You know where my routine
Inside the studio where I spend my time in
Fuck on the game until I make that bitch climax
Miss me with that shit that hates dying young
You can run to the poor hole
Pulling the pit stop
Car like a flip flop
Bitches applaud me like they wanna make my piss hot
I don't even travel, I don't need company
I think that in the long term I try to build a company
Kendrick the good boy
As I move I feel much better doing myself, I can only do it
I hope you do, I sincerely believe, I can only feel it later.
Some people say I'm rude, but I don't care if she says he or they
I'm not cool, but change how I feel about myself today
Nigga, what I guess is so powerful
That if the land dries up, it could spit out the ocean
Then hop on a jet ski and start West-Coastin '
Taking action in the heat of the night
So if the devil came, tell him I'm fine
Walk outside and then smell a whole key
Old woman made called the police
It's just an average Joe walking with his heart on his Pendex
Don't be afraid to speak
You all, Dwarf Max, swinging at Shaq now have a seat
You can never live with the oldest of my mom
Kendrick be your name
I understood well
My nigga locked up in the pin, that's what my mind writes
Ink on my brain
What happens
As I move I feel much better doing myself, I can only do it
I hope you do, I sincerely believe, I can only feel it later.
Some people say I'm rude, but I don't care if she says he or they
So let me start the third verse
Collecting your favorites is our curse
Fuck the system, the truth, the religion
Fuck George Bush, rappers who love dissin '
Fuck you because you don't see my vision
I fucked your new girlfriend too
Because she's cute and her ass
It looks like a grenade in denim
Fuck the groupies, fuck the gossiping bitches
Fuck niggas who can't fight, so pull the triggas
Fuck the new world price of gasoline that costs a life
I don't give a shit, you can keep your accessories
Kendrick every day Jay-Z wasn't lying
Dumbass
As I move I feel much better doing myself, I can only do it
I hope you do, I sincerely believe, I can only feel it later.
I'm not cool, but change how I feel about myself today
Ohhh, ohhhh, woahhh
Uh
Yeah uh
Mandela's ghost, I hope my flows continue to drive
Let these words be your Earth and your moon, consume each message
As I lead this army, I make room for mistakes and depression.
And with that said, my nigga, let me ask you this question:
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
When the shit hit the fan
(one two, one two)
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
Mandela's ghost, I hope my flows continue to drive
As I lead this army, I make room for mistakes and depression.
And with that said, my nigga, let me ask you this question:
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
You believe in me? You're fooling me
Could I easily disappoint you? Is your heart where it should be?
If I am tried in a court of law, if the industry cuts me off
If the government wants me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Or question my character and demean myself on each blog?
I want you to love me like Nelson, I want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're welcome
You tell me that my song is more than a song, surely it is a blessing
But a prophet is not a prophet until they ask you this question:
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Be sure to ask your friends
Mandela's ghost, I hope my flows continue to drive
Let my words be your land and your moon, consume every message
As I lead this army, I make room for mistakes and depression.
And with that-
You believe in me? How much do you believe in it?
Do you think she will stay if 25 years happen?
Do you think he can hold you when you fall behind bars, wounded?
Do you think you all have common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life expiring?
Who got your best interest?
How clinging are people who say they love you?
And who pretends?
How hard is your skin when they deliver you?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you fold by shaking your shoulders so as not to offend you?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions started whistling?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
You want to be remembered who delivered the message
That considered everyone's blessing
This is your lesson for everyone, let's say;
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
Won't you look to your left and right? Be sure to ask your friends
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
Mandela's voice, I hope this flow continues to drive
Let my word be your land and moon, consume every message
As I lead this army, I make room for mistakes and depression.
And if you travel with me, nigga ...
I was canceled before, I had abandonment problems
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let it bother me
I went to Robben Island to analyze; that's where your cell is
In order to find clarity, how much do you appreciate me?
Is this relationship false or real like heaven?
Look, I have to question everything; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blows, Murphy's Law
Generation X: Will I ever be your ex?
Defects of a small step ', mutilated by the mouth a little, pause
Get under stress, crawl under rocks, crouch down
It is respect, but tomorrow, put your back against the wall.
How many leaders did you say you needed and then left them for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter, assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh I know it's Michael Jackson, oh
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
When the shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?
That black man gave us "Billie Jean", you say he touched those children?
Mandela's ghost, I hope my flows continue to drive
Let my word be your land and moon, consume every message
And if you travel with me nigga let me ask you this question nigga
Misuse of your influence
Sometimes i did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
The resentment that turned into a deep depression.
I found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't want to destroy myself
Lucy's ills were all around me.
So I went to look for answers
Until I got home
Coming and going trying to convince myself of the stripes I won
Or maybe because A-1 was my foundation
But as my loved ones fought the ongoing war in the city
I was entering a new one
A war based on apartheid and discrimination.
It made me want to go back to town and tell friends what I learned.
The word was respect
Doesn't mean I can't respect you like a black man
Forgetting all the pain and pain that we cause ourselves in these streets
But I don't know, I'm not a mortal man
Maybe I'm just another nigger "
Shit and that's all I wrote
I was going to call him "Another nigger" but it's not really a poem
I felt like it's something you can probably relate to
Other than that, now that I finally had a chance to yell at you
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situation.
About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground
What do you mean by that, what does the ground represent?
Right
This is how I see it, my word is link
I see, and the ground is the symbol of the poor.
Right
Poor people will open this whole world
And swallow the rich
Because rich people are going to be so fat
And they are going to be so appetizing, you know what I say Rico, appetizing
The poor will be so poor and hungry
You know what I say, it will be like
You know what I say, it will be ...
There may be, there may be some cannibalism in this muh-fu-
Aight so let me ask you this then
Or someone who made the most of their own opportunities?
I look like a born scammer
A true swindler in every sense of the word.
I didn't take advantage of anything, I took advantage of opportunities
I worked in the most servile and degrading job
And I built myself so I could take it where I owned it
I went from having someone handle me
For me to hire the person who works in my management company
In a matter of five years, do you know what I'm saying?
Now is the time to make millions for me, do you know what I'm saying?
I made millions for the record companies
Now I make millions for us
How would you say you managed to maintain a level of sanity?
For my faith in God, for my faith in the game
And by my faith in "all good things come to those that remain true"
Right
You know what I'm talking?
You know what I'm saying, I was realizing shit
I was pressing the right buttons and it was happening
I mean, it's a problem, but I'm not going to let you know
I'm going straight
Do you consider yourself a fighter at heart or someone who
Is someone who only reacts when backing up against the wall?
And not just me but my family tree
You know what I say, it is in my veins to fight
Well how long do you think it will be before the niggas are like
"We are fighting a war, I am fighting a war that I cannot win
In this country, a black man only has
5 years we can display maximum strength
And that's now when you're a teenager, while you're still strong
While you still want to lift weights, while you still want to shoot again
Because once you turn 30 it's like
They take away the heart and soul of a man
From a black man, in this country
And you don't want to fight anymore
And if you don't believe me, you can look around
You don't see a noisy mouth 30-year-old motherfuckers
That is crazy, because I am one of your descendants
From the legacy you left behind, I can really tell you that
What do you think the future is for me and my generation today?
I think niggas are tired of grabbing shit from stores
And the next time it's a riot it'll be like, uh, bloodshed
I really don't think the United States knows that
Not going to be playing
It is going to be a murder, you know what I say?
It will be like Nat Turner, 1831, in this son of a bitch
You know what I say, it will happen
That's a crazy man, in my opinion.
A lot of people don't understand how important it is, you know
Sometimes I like to get behind a microphone
And I don't know what kind of energy I'm going to expel
Or where it comes from, sometimes it bumps into me
Because they are spirits, we are not even really rapping
We just let our dead friends tell us stories
Curse
I wanted to read you one last thing
It's actually something a good friend had written.
"The caterpillar is a prisoner of the streets that conceived it
Your only job is to eat or consume everything around you.
To protect yourself from this crazy city
The caterpillar begins to notice ways of surviving.
But praise the butterfly
The butterfly represents talent, consideration.
And the beauty inside the caterpillar
But having a hard perspective on life
The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
The caterpillar will work on the cocoon
You can no longer see beyond your own thoughts.
Its trapped
Go home and bring new concepts to this crazy city
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations
That the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and the caterpillar are completely different
What is your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac? Pac?
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Cooking the flow
Tryna takes my mom out of the neighborhood
I'm K-Dot if you didn't know
Aiming straight to the top
Hub city beat
87 baby 87 Cudi screaming "Fuck the police"
Peel off your top, don't talk, don't talk about me
I move discreetly, I think like a double OG
Inside an old school bumping oldies
Lame niggas get up off my street nigga
Before the big platform comes and runs over your brain
I spread niggas for your dividends
Forgive you innocent, Compton all my uncles wore Pendletons
West coast rider, bitch, I'm gonna ride her
Until the wheels fall off, buy more tires
Mmm, say hi to the new prince
Na'mean?
All day all night
Cooking the flow
How should i
Tryna takes my mom out of the neighborhood
So don't blame me if I hurry like I'm broke
Because all my life I've been bankrupt
Aiming straight to the top
Get out of my business
Because I've been handling the shit out of my business
The grinding had a perfect attendance
Uh, I've been a winner from the start
What do you mean I'm done? I'm just starting
But you're on the sidelines like Vince Lombardi
Weezy, newborn baby? and it's my party
And I'm kicking like a horse on the Ferrarri stick
Like new cocaine, bright yellow drug?
Bright red flag like a red velvet rope
When this shit is in, I'm deeper than your pool, so I swim without towels
Bitch I'm and I've been dancing
I'm in the studio
All day all night
Get my career right
Tryna takes my mom out of the neighborhood
So don't blame me if I hurry like I'm broke
Because all my life I've been bankrupt
Aiming straight to the top
Mmm, fuck 'em all up, kill' em all
Send them to the saint
Put a hole in one, like miniature golf
Price on your head, and they're trying to buy
Deliver the fabric
Fabric over the gun
Gun on your jaw
Bullet over your tongue
I put my cock inside hip-hop and the shorty came up
Every time I get a chance to come, I get over
On the drums
I don't tell you any
Get it? I don't tell you any
Catholic or Christian, holding the book of sums
In the back of my true religions
I never passed the bar but
Just to judge lyrics
Mmm, I should be the judge of the letters
Hit the hammer, it gives you a life sentence
I'm in the studio
Get my career right
How should i
Tryna takes my mom out of the neighborhood
So don't blame me if I hurry like I'm broke
Because all my life I've been bankrupt
Aiming straight to the top
As my mind wanders and then splits
Like in the middle of a joint, I start to catapult myself
I have the feeling in my strange bone that we are not the same
Only antonyms of another era
My soul gathers with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a gold D
Haha LMFAO
I hate them all but I spread love like May
Then scatter slugs
My brain stuff is a brain ghost
Look at my vision, or my vision will stare at you
This is the future if I say so, you are covering tight caps
I'm about to go find a halo.
The god of rap and I mean it, and I play soccer with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius, interact with the villains in the city center
What enters your system as a computer hack
Then go dap
I don't think they heard you, why don't you tell them what your name is?
Nigga my name is Kendrick, Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick, Lamar
I can tell you what it is
I can tell you what it is not
No more K. Dot
My mother had called me Kendrick.
That's the name they gave me
I'm just a good compton boy who wants to rap
I never killed a man
I never sold any crack
All I did was try to keep my city on the map
Put Smokey on my back
They don't want me to win
My people don't want me
Why do we hate each other?
My people don't want me
We can love each other
My people don't want me
Why do we ride another, we need to love each other
My people don't want me
I said we all have, I swear to God, dog, we all have
My people don't want me
The senseless death of this whole world
Universe beyond evil, a theme to serve
Be my black people, we'll miss the point like Shaq's free kick
Sean Taylor, life is gone for the enemies
A black man he knew tried to invade his house, it went wrong
Days later, arrangements to wake up, flowers to attend
That was so impatient, take it from the next man
Because you don't have the will to rush as you can
Kill for dividends
This life is critical, we live in a time where
9 year old totalizer
Turn 10, it's Mac 10 and coca lines
I wonder why the successful black man has to die from a black man
My people don't want me
Why do I have to accumulate some hatred wherever I go?
My people don't want me
Genocide everything we know shit, basically we're in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
Blacks don't love me
It can't be a positive black model
Leading the future with no enemies to follow
Now that's screwed, if I ever wanna see
Success, do I have to see death? Being famous for what?
He aims for higher education, you aim to tear him down
He flies right, you want to turn him
You burn your brother's bridges
His achievements making way for his children
No, I have never been, you never win, I have to lose
That is the slope that is for black inheritance
We make a fool better than comedians
Disobedient friend without respect, ethics
I refuse to be a statistic
But changing my community doesn't seem realistic
Show me an African American doing the right thing
I'll show you one that will kill her ass tonight
My people don't want me
Why do I have to accumulate some hatred wherever I go?
Genocide everything we know shit, basically we're in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it away from me
Blacks don't love me
We hate each other, we hurt ourselves
That's why today, blacks are going to love each other
We stay together in the days of slavery
The shit that we're doing, I know they're pouring into their graves
Yes, the one given for the cause, some like Jesus for us
We used to run away from the KKK
Man I never thought there'd be days like this
I can't trust your friends that you're dating
Damn shame, why are you killing a nigger for a chain?
When could you get up from your hustle and get the same
United, we are upright, divided, we all fall
The blacks we all have
My people don't want me
Why do I have to accumulate some hatred wherever I go?
Genocide everything we know shit, basically we're in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it away from me
Blacks don't love me
That's why today, blacks are going to love each other
You better wake up and smell the coffee
It's black on black killing each other, you need to stop
Honest talk
Blacks need to prepare
Change is coming, change is here
Hello if you listen to me
In 2Pac's memory sincerely
It's been a G, ever since I was standing four feet from the monkey bars
Steal a nigga's box like it's ours
Cars roll, no we don't fold
Shit, I put everything in the halls of high school
Montgomery never saw the dime bags
I cleaned my work, I finished a sale just before class ended
Now what happened, I'm old enough to put the world on my shoulders without a massage.
I never came back in the truck, we sat behind
Times are tough, the only time you pledge your loyalty
It's a gutter when the sun comes up
When the sun sets
Nothing but tears, no onions
Under ungodly functions, 187s and robberies will come
Don't go looking for it
You don't seem harsh
You better look foreign, I'm warning you
Your blood temperature, that corner full of forensic doctors
Neighbors are listeners.
Just because you have the flu doesn't mean you're sick enough
If California snows, then I did
On June 21 I will make a snow storm
The OG aims to shoot the moon
Bullets go through the atmosphere
Fear no one but God, the God of rap is here
And I can see you scared (Ugh)
Real gangsters either dead or in jail
And his album isn't really shit, he won't sell
No skates on my feet, just running the grass through life like soccer cleats
5 hours asleep, nigga, you do the math
It's 19 hours wasted, I have bad insomnia
But I can't complain or think too much, the passion that Albert Einstien won came
Did I have to hold my stomach for hunger pains to look?
This business has too many villains
Superman is back
The cape is not red, it is black
That's a raincoat
And the note for your information if we were dead this reincarnation
Take care of your heads
I don't need the hype
Call me, shit, I don't need an introduction
Without improvising my name 100 times for nothing
You know it's K. Dot, city of Compton
The analogy is like Biggie and Bed Stuy, Oakland and 2Pac
I'm more focused, I'm not like you new guys
Fighting for a few lines thinking you're hot
Because your homebody told you that you were several times
Which is too many times
They lie to you, they tell you a lie
The only time I go to bed in the cabin is when I sleep in it.
Record 24 hours, niggas better raise your bars
I do bench press with this rap material, I have it closed as handcuffs
My juice is on, and I wish one of you would try to steal from me
I shoot and I have you lying between the sheets with rented eyes (Isleys)
The helicopters come and realize that nothing is behind me.
Your honor, I fuck on this beat without a condom
This is not rap, it is really a pornography, roll me up again
Finally the best of all is back
To define crack laws, you do not obey
You are not nice, you are just fine
You're just a little phrase from John
Musical theme for Shaft, equivalent to the musical theme of your career
Just inspiration: something you never had
If my pockets is something you try to grab
I take out the rocket and take you off like a scab
You old news, old guys, get out of my way
Let the young man pass; don't mention my age
I'm on a mission for pay, and you astronauts niggas clutter up my space
You are not in my atmosphere, you can act like you here
But you're not really accurate fucking with the music business
The industry says "Fuck it, let the music be yours"
There's no theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Little shark, the jaws are here, jump into the water
Are you really fucking with President Carter?
My answer is that I can't get away from the bosses
I have the bidding war exploding like an auction
5 or 10 labels like what I was hitting for? 7 zeros or more?
I remember having Aftermath sitting on my doorstep
Money in front of me, I couldn't open the door.
Boom! That's it, left him face up
You're talking like that, Jack, spitting
Rap but some niggas wake up, talent they lack
My pockets are getting fat, your pockets are flat
So I'm just hollaback, rock your little J's
But niggas ain't get paid on the spot, like they're slaves
12 hours just for some change, man, this shit is a shame
When the feds come, who will you blame? But that's just
Learning the game, you niggas should do the same
They go as fast as they came, because when you pass me you will not see
I'm going bar by bar, and b, you're just a target, b
So just call me Muhammed Ali
I leave you with the (?), Choose a wide, about three or two
Life is like a puzzle, but my level is a problem, man, you have to use your muscle, in the hood I had to fight
Man, I'm moving to the store, (?), Man, you're not
Niggas talk constantly but hardly look at the place
I'm so far ahead of my time, I have people in 5 years pressing rewind
I'm hardly friends with you, I hate rappers, where's your artist?
If it's not a good drawing, don't bring it to the architect
You often argue about who came next, claiming you're running the game
Niggas barely walk yet, they jump everywhere without studying the training ground
Your flow in the same place, just don't rap; to elaborate
Try to expand, try to be more creative maybe
My rap friends, I'm not saying you're crazy, psyche
Like a voice, I'm just stating the facts, right?
(?) metaphors that I write, in fact, it has been a factor
Don't compare me to them, it's like a shark against Nemo, a gorilla against a chimpanzee, Jordan against Kukoč
A Tony Montana with a blow to the nose to a child
I remember it, uhh
When my uncles
Smokers served
In Lark
In front of our building, they were my heroes.
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
Bad bitches, crack junkies, street niggas, crack hoes
Dope beat, dope flow, they vary for me
Especially when Sounwave is on his P
Do not fast forward, I will serve you some keys
And hit me like a C-R-I-P
P-I-R-U, stop, I'm an I-V
I said an I-V because when I'm in the studio I shot
A needle in your veins, take it in your vein
Or sting until your eyeballs explode
I'm cold in the cold turkey
I hate chickens but I fuck pretty little birds
Where is your girl About the Pyrex, where my world is in
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
Bad bitches, crack junkies, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
Uhh, and I'm scared
Every listener is a strawberry to me
A nightmare, I'm there like a Siamese
-Twin, when are you going to learn mothafuckas?
Who flies I am a red eye with eye drops
I Big, I Pac, you Chris, I Rock
I'm the first to do that, I bet you never knew
Back as a tailbone, who do you have to tell?
If it's not about me about how it's about face
If you are not at a higher level, learn
There are soft drinks in the pot and the fire, burning
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
Bad bitches, crack junkies, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
Uhh, and it's scary to wear
Smooth flow like a Merlot drink
That will scare them like a Virgo girl
When I turbo on any track, it's a Reynold wrap
And I rap like a nigga who invented rap
Hitting the heat, you can fall to beat
If you don't pay tolls like the limbs on your feet
I guess this is bigger than life.
Probably all of them, Illuminati
I strip her like a Harley
The lights will flash, the cars will crash
Smoke more trash while addicts laugh
They refund you, put it on my tab
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
Bad bitches, crack junkies, street niggas, crack hoes
This shit is so silly, maybe you want to be my hoe
I love the way you put it in your eyes
And girl, it's fine, but I want to know, do you mind?
Without makeup today, without makeup today
No makeup today, no makeup for ...
And girl, it's fine, but I want to know, do you mind?
I know you're about to ask me what it looks like
I say beautiful and how long it took
It looked like a model from a Mac book
Focus on how the liner thickens
I stand behind her and try to imagine her vision.
Your complexion in a direction that I've overcome
Damn girl, why so much?
You're about to explode when you cover yourself
Don't you know that your blemishes are a wonderful blessing?
From heaven, it's where you got it
From your lips to your eyebrows
I love the way you put it in your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all the time
And girl, it's fine, but I want to know, do you mind?
Without makeup today, without makeup today
No makeup today, no makeup for ...
And girl, it's fine, but I want to know, do you mind?
I know you're about to ask me what it looks like
It looked like a model from a Mac book
Concentrating on how my liner thickens
He stands behind me and tries to imagine his vision.
My complexion in a direction that I have overcome
I can never do too much makeup
Yes, I know your imperfections, I am constantly stressed
That's where I get it from, they tell me I need
Smile at least once in a while
I hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows.
It is the beauty in me, but what he does not see.
Ladies and gentlemen
And you don't have to get drunk to have fun
You don't have to get drunk to have fun
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all the time
And girl, it's fine, but I want to know, do you mind?
Without makeup today, without makeup today
No makeup today, no makeup for ...
That's fine, but I want to know, do you mind?
Ladies and gentlemen
And you don't have to get drunk to have fun
You don't have to get drunk to have fun
I love the way you put it in your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all the time
And girl, it's fine, but I want to know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup for ...
That's fine, but I want to know, do you mind?
A massive attack, I chase you
I mastered rap and then I fucked up the monitors
I mastered that after that I went for thermometers
Holla back we were promised
No sleepless pajamas
I'll attack, I'll attack like the piranha does
Hit your block like a kite (blah!)
And you all know what time it is
2012, mark on your calendars and silencers that exercise that activation strap
Rock with us, Metallica, competition without talent
I'm in a jungle that's wild enough
Don't lie to my soldiers dying, this is Iraq
Alliances aligned with stars and bars of a prison representative
My science applies pressure, your stretcher is needed, pay the winnings
You niggas can't see me unless you're watching TV or hugging my silhouette
It means my dick is death's dick, it means I'm killing that pussy
Like Spike every time Jerry slept
Yes Dre
Me and Andre the giant, 6'7 and climbing
Whether you storm your weather
Whether your rhythm is doing or rhyming
Bumpin a little Phyllis Hyman
Hand full of diamonds like Jay's fans
On an island with Ray Bans
Palmin 'ass glasses that probably came with a great tan (laughs)
I'm the damn mecca of this spectrum of central cities
They'll probably call the federal after I kill several
Etcetera, etcetera Bentley going celicas
Tell us about shit, HiiiPoWeR in your mouth, bitch
And Top Dawg can answer bitch
Nigga, what do you think, over the face in army outfits?
The generals here
That means scammers and criminals here
Penance reaches the pinnacles of life and despair and I solemnly swear to handle mine like a Taliban and die for it.
The only difference is that I am never asking Allah
The only difference is that I'm spazzin 'and I'm still a proud poet
Put me in a category
I don't know what a sadder story is
Guts and glory
Your pain bored me, you really haven't lived it
I take you to a block where Crippin
Or Piru who is 5'2 bigger than Pippen's torso
Show me something different
Either you kiss my cock or you give me away
You live in a district of dimebags and dummies. I know your statistics.
Who's your boss? He looks more like my assistant.
Lose yourself, eat an egg and a cookie
It breaks fast when we point cookies at them
Q ... Q
Bend, shit, what the fuck?
Give me some of my poppin 'promotion
Setbacks fall
Soon look
I just locked and loaded explode
Marriotts and Swisher sweets
LA nigga prolly este
X O henny scrapes the keif
Bangin C, I'm hitting B
Put them niggas by my side
Stop and focus to take the lead
I'm here now, let the hardest speak
All those guys already have ovaries, period
Run on sentence I'm still ventin '
Air conditioning in the cooler breeze
Sick diseases
Grab my penis shoot my cum
I'm still coming, miles running
The head throbs, she is a leprechaun
We're mobbin 'on bitches
Stick and miss and she the business
Get a witness frenchin pussy
If a mission
Poppin 'off like on a mission
Trample a nigga, crush a nigga
Dust a nigga, Copperhead is gonna push a nigga
Warming up the winning nigga
Something to remember nigga
Hella sick, I have a grill
Damn with a verse like God told me to kill the shit
Load the Heckler & Koch clip
The Vacuum King
Natural vacuum cleaner
Fing ring with a vision that clarifies it with Visine
Asian beijing
Money makes her cum, she C.R.E.A.M
At first with raindrops
Autobot
Space shuttle shitting in your car lots
Boy style
At least I could have a Saturn, huh?
Working on tracks like we've never been free
22 black squezze shooting out of C
Please thought a nigga shot 16
Rhyme 16
Bada bing, bing, bing, bing ... bing
If you want to be from HiiiPoWeR
Please come to the friends area
But don't wowwy
You won't suck my dick tonight
I am more concentrated, I see that I am not like you new [?]
Thinking they're hot because her friends said it was a few times
Which is often lying to you, telling a lie
The only time I go to bed in the cabin is when I sleep in it.
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get their bars
I do bench press with this rap material, I have it closed as handcuffs
I threw away the key, my calm is on, she loves my air conditioner
My jewelry is on and I wish one of you would try to steal from me
I shoot and I laid you down between the sheets with the Isleys
We push the coupe at high speed and the helicopters come and realize that there is nothing behind us, it is behind me.
Your honor, I fuck on these beats without a condom
This is not really a rap, it is a porn, go back
Redefine a loss, right, they don't obey
All of you more than a phrase from Lil Jon
I'm Mike Jordan at his best, a modern Issac Hayes
Fingers on the axis, new to the musical theme of your career
Old men get out of my way and let the young man pass, don't mention my age, SHIT
I'm on a mission for pay and you niggas astronauts just clutter up my space
You are not in my atmosphere, you can act as if you were here
But you're not really screwed with this music business
Industry like "Fuck it, let the music be yours"
There's no theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Little shark, Jaws is here, jump into the water
I have the bidding war exploding like an auction
Five or ten labels like "What's it hitting for?", Seven zeros or more
I remember having Aftermath sitting on my doorstep
I'm hardly impressed with you guys, I hate rappers
They are often arguing over who came next
Claiming you all run the game, niggas barely walking
Jumping everywhere without going through the training ground
Try to study some cool things and then maybe you will be where I am
Changing your flow, your flow in the same place
Don't just elaborate, expand, try to be more creative maybe
My rap friends, I'm not saying hit, psycho
Like an invoice, I'm just stating the facts, right?
The metaphors that I write
In fact, you have been a factor that you have feared all your life, there is no television program
A Tony Montana with a blow to the nose to a child
Before I kill myself, lives will be taken
Mmm, real hip-hop, west coast
I i
I see a million MCs die, lyrical murder
Hit them again less than 5 exact minutes, then run away from the scene
This is Armageddon, two weapons, two palms.
A vietnam man
.45 popper, rhymes like the 9-5 big poppa
On a seven-story yacht, eat lobster with my comrades
He gave it out of courtesy
Lay back while I jump in my underground shit
Like a subway, derail the track, the real thing is black
True orators, hitmen, crime payers, flamethrowers
Hurry in front of the corner stores
It's not a threat, I'm doing myself a favor
With suicide
Before committing suicide
Before committing suicide
Suicide, it's suicide
Suicide, it's suicide
Suicide, it's suicide
I have my mind on murder and murder on my mind
You are a liar, you and I are not the same
I flow like water, purify microphones
Ask Sean Carter, Nasir Jones
Or anyone sitting on the throne
Don't postpone your career
Women, children, I passed in traffic
I can't drive, the cars collide
I have a death wish, you could be on my guest list
Guns clap in the direction of your sepsis
It doesn't matter your gender, not sexist
You MC? You better give up
Killing these rappers
Training in winter, training in summer
More practice, let's continue
You are absolutely right, I spit it out quite accurately
And every time the verse ends, it means I took another life
Suicide, it's suicide
Suicide, it's suicide
Suicide, it's suicide
(Oh, motherfuckers, they think I'm playing, huh? Let me get on my Dad Kane shit, jump on my shit, 'You mean?)
I remove MCs under concrete
An assassin, I put these rappers on their deathbed
One shot to the heart, one more to the head
My rhymes are so smart that I never fall
From a nigga in the industry, they're all taken out
But not from a sawmill, but rather like an uzi
He spits out rap, and these succulent MCs are chewed, B
Money, power, respect, pussy and guns.
Hoes pop pills like a modern ritual
But I don't sweat them all, I just decapitate them all
And leave the party jumping like B-ball players
Board B, those who catch will die
Destroy any rapper you think makes noise
It's K-Dot, the terminator.
Fake rhyming killer rapper
Those who live now will die later
Suicide
Yes Yes. So, all of you curious. It's okay. That's fine, man. I'm ... look, I'm telling you how your boy, Moochie, landed on this damn blow. It was Kendrick. Yes, Kendrick Lamar.
So is. The shit was wild, damn it.
This son of a bitch.
We had a ball. Oh, black, you don't have to believe me, black. Dammit.
He is just talking about it.
Man, you haven't been here that long. Your permanent is still new. So anyway. You know what I'm saying? We had strippers. They let us do everything we wanted to, touch anything we wanted to touch. I was putting my finger in places, but my fingernail was about to fall off.
Kill these motherfuckers. Can you hear me?
Get that money and get out.
Man, you should have heard what this little nigger was talking about, man. Talking so much shit on the block. Man, I've been trying to tell you. You are talking about making more money than me, making more money than you. I said, "Fuck this son of a bitch, man. This little son of a bitch is about to be hit right now. Fuck him. Fuck this son of a bitch right now."
But you don't listen to what he said.
Nigga, I'm a smoke ass. Now you're smoking, talking shit. What, bitch? Than? Than? Let's go. Let's go. Come on. You're talking about that shit. Where's this motherfucker? Nigga, get out of here.
Hi boy. When I got there, I already had two bottles and three pussies deep. [Laughter] Do you hear what I say? It was on, boy. I barely stood up at the end. Aw yeah it was great man. We were getting discouraged, having a good time, dancing, dancing. Everything was calm. They were showing love to your boy. [Laughter] But something was wrong. I knew something was wrong, man. You know, sometimes you have that feeling. Like when a real and pretty woman shows you genuine love. Oh, that's not right. But that's when I saw Kendrick out there with my lady. Man, I spent the night at his house and accompanied his daughter to school. You know, that means you have forced me. But I wasn't stumbling too much, you know? As I said, I was already three pussies deep. You know, I kind of respect your boy, Kendrick. Yes, everything was great, man. Well shit, man, nobody told me.
This is special, man. As my boy Mozzy says, you know, God is on top all the time. We really talk, you know. Hip-hop, man. I said hip-hop.
From the jump I thought it was all about the compliments, the cars and the clothes. But it's really about expressing yourself and putting that painting on the canvas so that the world evolves for the next listener, the next generation after that, you know what I'm saying? Hip-hop has done it for me.
I have a lot of guys in this building right now who still idolize me to this day: Jay-Z, Nas, Puff, you know. These boys showed me the game through their lyrics, up close and far.
So with that said, this hip-hop trophy, a real conversation. That is love, darling. Jay for president!
Tell the teacher that I need to fuck on his fast pace
I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my journey
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9
That is not a lie, ho
Rappers go crazy so I have to go
Psycho on these niggas, call me Norman Bates with a poker face
I got the punch in my hand and I'm out to touch your face
The housing authority saved my Section 8
My section will be on the west side of Compton Cali, champion
Let a rapper tell me I'm no better than who's out
I'm going to knock them out of their Force 1 once I kick them out
Air jets flying 'cross the atlas, I made it mom, I made a promise
Married to hip hop, and the bridesmaid will be R&B
I'm fucking her too, so please give me my condoms
Where the honeymoon in the mother's cabin
You're fucking fine, I'm the fucking truth
Tell my mom not to feel sorry because her son was a gunner
They found my dead body with a rapper's head in my stomach
I would never stop what you can't see
It's like a red light when you drive with Stevie
I run the game with both hands as you collide
Like Earnhardt, my heart to the fallen soldiers
You can ride or tip
Sleeping on me, I put you in a coma
So relax before you meet the coldest
Hold him
I'm the best rapper under 25, 24 inches on my journey
Ball like 23 and I shot my first .22 when I was 9
And my soldiers killed 20 of your troops at once
And I have about nine teenagers in the corner fucking with marijuana
Jive and heard about 18 rappers say a bird can go for 17.5
Damn, my 16 candy is equivalent to about 15 cakes
I was 14 years old when I wrote a rhyme
All I saw was 13 ghosts every time I wrote a crazy line
All these 12 bars in my verses, that's what Notorious and Pac got
Damn, I spit like a Mac 11 every time
I drop jewelry, you drop dime, you pretend to be like mine
I intend to put about 10 rappers on channel 9
Direct, fuck and eat
Money when I sink my teeth into Carter III beats
For you, my son, the victory is mine, I won
I am the one
The beat was the pussy
And I run hard
When I jumped off the porch, I was forced to resort to the last resources of a temper that had fallen short.
And of course when that took its course I snore when yelling
The demons that fought within me taught society how to rejoice
Assassins by my side, privacy obviously lost
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed ...
A good boy in a crazy city, a little upset
I walk down the street without heat and I find beef when I'm just vegan
Stinking the scent of a saint, sinners smell it and then start squeezing
Pellets falling directly into my melon, apparent reason ...
That was Blooding in public and Kendrick saw it last weekend, cuz
But you're not related to me, probably Kendrick, I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, shoot as your remedy
Fair enough, I have enemies but I don't hit
But that's the repercussion, like when your cousin is staining blood
And you're all alone in the Compton show
Life or death
You are with me
Wassup
Man, Beyoncé, I'm mad at you
Man...
They say hello (ay) .. Hello (ay)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
See you
They say hello (ay) .. Hello (ay)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
Until I saw the video with the ring in your hand
It hurts me a lot
I remember you were 16 years old on the TV screen with Wyclef
Were you my type Oh god yes i was impressed
Hoping that someday I can accompany you while you were on the road
You wore braids with a bangin body
It looks like you did pilates, a lot of squats probably
But stop that, I was there from the beginning
Even when Latoya Luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
I hope you have not cried because, honestly, they were more or less
They couldn't sing anyway, you deserve to go alone
Without disrespecting Kelly and Michelle, I'm just saying they are great
But you? You are something like Wonder Woman
And I just want to hold your hand, take you to Compton
Gonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand
Eating hot cheetos with pickle juice
Put down that napkin, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're done
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinking of the good times before meeting Jay
See you
They say hello (ay) .. Hello (ay)
I really thought I had a chance to be your man
It hurts me a lot
I looked at the cover for a full 5 minutes until my girlfriend hit me
She is jealous of you because I don't love her like I love you
I even make her do the "uh oh, uh oh" just like you do
Like Ice Cube long before the Mac 10 fight
She's like "damn fool, that girl is rich and you're broke"
Anyway, I had feelings even before you got paid
And I greet Kanye for looking for you
But Jay should have done that, I thought he had your biz-ack
What happened, Mister Izzo? Hopico? Fredrico?
Used to be my favorite until he ditched my diva
They say hello (ay) .. Hello (ay)
I can daydream about Beyonce all day
Thinking of the good times before meeting Jay
You never know, hmm ...
I'm going to sneak behind the scenes at a Mary J Blige concert
In a "I love Mary" t-shirt, find Jay-Z
It was then that I screamed "Sun wave! Hurry up, take the picture!"
Put it on Bossip the same night, yeah, that sounds pretty good
Advertising like that? Yes, they would be sure to fight
Better yet, I'm going to steal your cell phone, then I'll call Affion
Impersonating Jay well put Beyonce on the line
Then make up a fake shit like "You don't rub the back of my knees well
What about the ring on my finger? Guess what? I'm throwing it away!
Haha that should catch them
That should break them like a Kit Kat when I do that, yes it's true that
I'm going to put the plan into action, that's for sure
Yeah man I hope Jay doesn't get mad at me for this song
Start-ay, Wizzle pulls me back like the first verse
Like just before entering
Haha, what do you say? Nah, do you think it will be really hot?
Nigga, stupid, they probably laugh as much as you do
Nigga has the best wife in the world and that shit
Run that back?
Classic, young gotti
Gangsta, gangsta
Look, swallow your pride and then eat a dick
I'm Rick Rubin at 85 with a thick beard
I tell you I'm one up, sun down then sun up
Son, son niggas, I probably fucked up your mother
Pussy, tell your honor that this trauma is Jeffrey Dahmer
It took me too many moons to set up this new platoon
Being ambushed or kicked, pushed with a broom
Man look, your man, it looks like fresh water
Big Homie said I have to crawl before I walk
And if I passed my mouth, they would cut my legs
I'm just a young boss with a cave of bats
Tell them to put my name on the blimp
Ball like I'm Derrick Rose, you should know my gym
And prick your Gatorade with gasoline, I'm disgusting
I'm in the crowd like Artest and they
Drill lines mean I'm really going to hit civilians
Crisis time means I take it to the hole
Not this basket, but the nice pussy I'm in
I kill you niggas, I make you wait shake
Blank ribbons in your gavel, niggas still break your neck
They hear you need tagged plans just to spin
I need to clear it up with the bank just to win
Club accounts go 15 racks when you get wet like that shit
Hm. These hoes squeeze me because I'm a winner
When we eat canned food for dinner, I cover the food and the tools ... they make my schedule
This assault is a deadly weapon
Blame your favorite rapper, latest favorite rapper
We fuck your baby actress on the map, what a blessing
Make the pussy go up, she calls my dick antidepressant
I'm really not depressed, none of you niggas stressed
Those are some of you niggas who bless with the gift of wearing presence.
A great Pac and pop with ... and with investments
15 minutes come with 60 seconds
It occurred to shitty writers to block blacks in this stressful
Who cares? Who the hell cares? Even if you get drunk
Still be a millionaire
You could play a Santa Claus and make sure you're all loved
Every line I put that bitch in the hearse, while the boy screams
Uh Church to your pussy and push me to get the package ...
I see that you cookie read it, my foot is here big boy
And you don't stop
And it doesn't stop
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop
And bitches rub their tits like they think these monkeys are rich
Monkey, look what monkeys do, you monkeys never tip
Get the shit up the tree on you
Paranoid shit and bricks that can build the castle
Hurry up and break your fence
I know pterodactyls that still exist
Clappin, if you resist cooperating, go home and watch your daughters leave.
You are at risk if you wear a bracelet, we want your wrist
We can test it from the planet Pluto
Dog Gonnit terrifies you like a poodle that rips your ass off and congratulates you
Sevillas with white walls, clean them with my shoe
I feel like you're just menthol, meant to be smoked and sent to your maker
Mean is not a hood high up in California and G watches snoops
And you don't, and you don't and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop
Yes ah
1 2, LA, what about that?
Kendrick Lamar
You dig that, we're here
Look
While I am in Compon stomping through the swamp to exchange meeting
Returning to Los Angeles, already
Trying to see what poppin is
you can not stop me
We are the best, with the west
I've been put in all the OG's
Dre Snoop, Quick Easy E
DJ Quick and now it's me
So you see the game, now we are going to change
All the fucking game wrecks, I know you're lame
Compton you should already know the name, yeah, we got it out
I scream all over the west side cause I got it like this
And if we had it once, we got it back immediately
And if you ever had it, you won't have it anymore
And if we see the back to the front door
Taking your bread, crucifying everyone with their heads
What happens?
And you stop, and you stop, and you stop
And you do it, and you do it, and you do it and you do it
And you do it, and you do it, and you do it and you do it
And you do it, and you do it, and you stop
The parasites in my stomach keep me feeling good, you guys
I have to see how I relax once I park this luxury car
Jumping feeling big like Mutombo
20 at the pump six dirty Marcelo called me Dumbo
20 years ago I can't forget
Now I can give my full attention to how to stack this waste
Ten times, the liberal concept of what men will do
20 in 6, you didn't hear me
African Indians only spoke Zulu, my American language was suspicious
Whoever passed me only asked 10 thousand dollars, emphasizing on dry land
Blue skies, powder blue skies and then open up
Piece of crack I wanted, I knew I was smoking
He asked me to feed him twice, he didn't believe it, I told him to hit him
He contributed money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said "my son, temptation is one thing that I defeated
Listen to me, I want a single invoice from you
Nothing less, nothing more "
I said I didn't have it and then closed the door
And this is a freestyle start
And if you know me, you know that K.Dot won TDE
We are the champions, we do not agree
You can't see it, so you better believe
This is the encryption, I need them to make them vomit some words
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop
This is the message that I'm too bad, straight from Compton
If you come through my city, you will be trampled
The Watts neighborhood and Long Beach
Boy you're out of reach
This is TDE, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock
Schoolboy Q, we are hot, you are not
I am a representative every time I come to the laboratory
If you wanna see me boy take the taxi
Because you can't ride with me, you can't see the streets
My house boy Dave will take you straight
Drinking that juice and gin and that's a classic
Coming directly from Dre and Snoop
If you want us, jump inside the group
This is straight hip hop, this is off the top
And when I move you feel it
If it's us and then you hear it
Now when I give it back I beat the beat like my enemy
Hand over the bars everyone agrees on
I love the pianos and I love the flow
I love the drum, I love ... oh, I can't curse on the radio
Because if I do, they could let me go
I'm next to the best, I walk to the best
I represent the West, please don't try to prove
Everyone wants to rock, but they can't
Because they come from Rosecrans Street [?]
We drop it on top of the board for real
And that's a swish, that's a network, alley oop
I feel like we're the champions and these gods will stomp on you
I come through your block and crash everything you want or got out
And if you know my flow, then you know how it goes
If you know death row then you know Eazy then you know Dre
So you know Snoop and you know we don't play
I said we don't stop boy we run hip hop
D-O-T, D-A-W-G, K-D-O-T, C-P-T
L-B-C West, W-A-T-T-S, Jay Rock, he doesn't play
Niggas and guards, projects
Whatever you want? We can collide at any time with the biceps
You know I'm so gross, you know I'm off the top
You know this hip hop, you know I cut
The roof from the birth of the earth.
And I've been doing this since church
With small pants, with soft strap
If you rap like that boy we suspend you
We contenders are at the top of the map
We are on top of the world and yes, this true rap
Running like cheetahs, we run this game and I win
And [?] Man on the beat right now
He will flip it and please believe
Every 16 bars is like ours
And if you want it, then let's take over, what happens?
Tonight is the night I jump off my shit
And every time the words go around the ringmaster, but I don't stumble
I keep walking, I keep pushing and I put them in a coffin
You often look for the best, I'm here
We are talking, you look for stress, you are there
Keep walking, you look for the west, right here
You stalking the flow, you often know
I want you to know that you have been doing this since the days of Death Row and Ruthless
I've been ruthless, the coupe has been homeless
Spit, the words have no teeth
But it gets like that because you feel it
I have Rikki on my side and she relaxes
Big Boy on my side and he will
It's my handwriting, it's my pen
It's my role when I start
And she's been reciting my rhymes
So for those who didn't know
Big Boy puts on the microphone and kicks a bad current
About 10 years ago I received this call
He said "Uncle Big Boy, I want to start rapping"
I said "what's up, little friend?", He said "I want to start catching
I want to start covering, I want to start going to the studio "
He said "yell, I want to shake the place"
I said "what's your name?", He said "my name is K.Dot"
I said "K.Dot, okay, I think I feel you
Record it and then press play "
He said "ok", it was very rude that I took K.Dot in
He was one of my little students.
Do I receive an A, B, C, D, E or failure? "
I said "are you okay" his head started to swell
He said "there is a guy in Compton who has TDE"
I said "Top Dawg? Wait, that's my partner
He wants this, but don't smoke a joint
He said "big boy, I've been a student, I'm about sixteen"
He started doing uhh, he started doing these shows
And he became poetic, he became energetic
Spotetic, all those -etics
More -etics, more editions
Then o-etics, and then an o-etics
And then I gave them that pass
Before entering they had a missing sound
Well you know what niggas
I'm just going to play Kendrick
Feel this
Uh let me shit on these niggas man
Look friend, I'm not your cripple or your blood
Homie, I'm just Kendrick
Surprised to have dialed as smooth as a baby
Why you provoke it doesn't mean boasting a little
‘Because all it takes is a finger to light it holmes
Definitely, but still dark, I think I could change the Jaguar for the Porsche
‘Because it has better steering grip
Young but he's been a man and you won't understand
Spree wheels that look like a room ceiling fan
When the meat starts to cook
And the shots start to come
Don't hesitate to burst that thing
People start looking
And people start to run
Don't hesitate to burst that thing
Rolling down rosecrans
I'm not afraid of any man
If I live on my knees I'd rather die standing
That shit from the city center of shit is me
(Nigga) I'm from the land where demons fly like Peter Pan
And the average man got hot in his dickie pants
I have some plans to accumulate wealth
You don't know but now I'm focused as a camera lens
And if I know your man, I could give you a second chance
‘Because I don't want to hurt you
Make them run in herzels
Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
Crack sells, sells drugs all in virtue
I've been an artist since Prince played Color Purple
Hydro grass smoke blow on that purple
2 straps next to me as suspenders in Urkel
Suspend being killed, why are you lying?
You know you're not eating like feeding the commercials of children
Man my kids go round your block
Drop vaccinations and go home 30 minutes before curfew.
When the meat starts to cook
Don't hesitate to burst that thing
People start looking
And people start to run
Don't hesitate to burst that thing
Rolling down rosecrans
I'm not afraid of any man
Be god damn
If I live on my knees I'd rather die standing
That shit from the city center of shit is me
Kendrick
Come to me as a man, man
Kendrick
Niggas respect me man (K.Dot)
Stop being a black yank
Lotta niggas tryin 'to play gangsta, huh?
It's 2004 man
You're in this shit, leave it
Be yourself
Blacks respect me, bitch
What is your life about? enlighten me
Shoot between your little sister's two legs
Just take a sip of this elixir
Before they take us off the scene
But I've seen cops surround the block
I blow squares, but I swear one day I will stop
My nerves are itchy
On the brink of my career
While my colleagues fight for employment
(Uncle Sam is not related to me) One, two
Section 80 Babies Blame Ronald Reagan
We're raising hell, hell (Oh)
The president is black, but you can't vote for the skin
You vote for the best man
Come to our show, you can see the diversity
Unify people, they will look at it universally
We may not change the world
But let's manipulate it, I hope you participate
Ayo, Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we would be here, like in 04 '
HiiiPower started because our generation needed a generator
And all we do is help them
We are not overcomers, we are victims
The largest image has yet to be developed.
What if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy meets a real man
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
With your girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And all stumbling 2012
And the alien presence too
(Odd Future's aight) But our future is not
That shitty drop of martial law, we're all going to have
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work from nine to five
Don't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you're alive
HiiiPower
We focus like the Hubble telescope
Soul!
Life is a bottleneck, life is a bottleneck
Life is a bottleneck
Life is a bottleneck, life is a bottleneck
I'm ready to go, ready to go
Life is a bottleneck, life is a bottleneck
Life is a bottleneck
Lifetime...
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie, I do it, Section 80
Your son will touch me if the radio doesn't
Daughters who have just turned 1 to 21 listen to Kendrick
What is your life about? enlighten me
Are you going to live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan and pay your college degree
And do exactly what you see on television
True story!
Hmm
Can you repeat that for me, soul?
What is your life about? enlighten me
Are you going to live on your knees or die on your feet?
Now is the time, my daughter, come on
Look, many of you don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothing, God and history, all in the same sentence.
Only half the truth, if you say so
Look, I spent 23 years on this earth looking for answers
Until one day I realized that I had to invent mine
I'm not outside looking in
I'm not inside looking outside
I'm in the damn center, looking around me
Have you ever seen a newborn baby kill an adult man?
That's an analogy of the way the world makes me react
My innocence has been dead
So the next time you talk about money, hoes, clothing, God, and history, all in the same sentence.
I just know I meant it, and you felt it
Because you are also looking for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next rapper with a social conscience
I'm a human motherfucker who's on drug instruments
Kendrick Lamar!
Now screw them, Terrace!
(Soul!)
I look at this fire in which we are gathered
And look how it burns similarly to the fire inside you
Section 80
Section 80 babies
A generation of happiness and disobedience.
You know they can't control us
You know they can't control you
But we can control ourselves
We build our own world
If you don't go with anything else tonight
You will go with knowing yourself
Our family
Heart, honor and respect
This is you
And we are HiiiPower
Lord forgive me! Lord forgive me!
Things that I do not understand
Sometimes i need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I have my drink, I have my music
I would share it, but today I'm screaming
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Look inside your soul and you can discover that it never exists
I can feel a new life, I always knew that life can be dangerous
I can say I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this image?
When the color blind is hanging with you?
It fell on my face and I woke up with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Why does every creation of this bother you?
Tell me your purpose is mean again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
I can feel that the new people around me just want to be famous
So put me on stage, for me that's amazing
To you that's a quick checkup
With all disrespect, let me tell you this
I am a sinner who will probably sin again
Lord forgive me! Lord forgive me!
Things that I do not understand
Sometimes i need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy two planets away
I would share it, but today I'm screaming
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I'm trying to keep it alive
You're trying to keep it private
And they only sign together what the radio does
And I'm looking beyond you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axes.
You live in a world, you live behind the mirror
I know what you are afraid of
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in an unfortunate vanity, tell me a watch and a chain.
It is much more credible, give me a feasible profit
I will let people know that this is something you can blame
In yourselves, you can remain trapped in a box
I'm going to go out and then hide each lock
I'm going to go out and then hide each lock
I can feel the changes
You can see that my city found me
So put me on stage, for me that's amazing
To you that's a quick checkup
I am a sinner who will probably sin again
Lord forgive me! Lord forgive me!
Things that I do not understand
Sometimes i need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You haven't heard the coast like this in a long time
Can't you see that long tail?
And they wait for Kendrick as the first and the fifteenth
Three in the air, I can see that you're in sync
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Get out the door and yell he's alive
My new year's resolution is to stop all pollution
He talks too much, damn, I have my drink, I have my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, let's go out!

I can feel your energy two planets away
I would share it, but today I'm screaming
Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
Look into my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside your soul and you can discover that it never exists
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew that life can be dangerous
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this image?
It fell on my face and I woke up with a scar
Another mistake living deep in my heart
Wear it over my sleeve in a movie
Why does every creation of this bother you?
Tell me your purpose is mean again
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes
You can see that my city found me

You live in a world, you live behind the mirror
I know what you are afraid of
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in an unfortunate vanity, tell me a watch and a chain.
It is much more credible, give me a feasible profit
Rather a seasonal name
I will let people know that this is something you can blame
In yourselves, you can remain trapped in a box
I'm going to go out and then hide each lock
I'm going to go out and then hide each lock
I can feel the changes

Trick, don't kill my vibe! Trick, don't kill my vibe!
My new year's resolution is to stop all pollution
Talk too much about mom, I have my drink, I have my music
Ayy, K-Dot, get in the car!
Come on, let's go out!
I have a pack of niggas and a beat CD
Prepare your freestyle!
You don't know what pain is, you only fuck with celebrities
I don't know you, I can say that your energy is dangerous
You don't know how long it took to finally come alive
So bitch don't kill my vibe
Yes, I can feel the changes, and I can tell you that you hate
Save your breath I'm sick of fake congratulations
So what, so what, so, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

I watch the game and watch porn there
I'm fucking hard on this industry
I'm packing this money, packing your tea, honey
You thought I was fresh out of the yard
Don't cry to me silly, you're a light weight
They call me nice and I say "wait"
Go get me a knife, you look like a steak
And when the stakes are high, I gamble for days
But we are not thirsty black, never warn me black
I have a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, friend, I'm in the extra environment
Come down on the sidewalk when you heard that I received these words
For the top rung, that's excellent (that's excellent)
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Sometimes i need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy two planets away
I would share it but today I'm screaming
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch don't kill my vibe
The rumors on the ground get too loud
Please shut the shit up, I can't hear myself thinking
Turbulence, shit, almost spilled my drink
In the white house with mink
Running through that bitch like it's my house
Everything in the hallway like a shopping mall
I told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I do not make you a member, I do not intend to
Empty my memory bank
Sitting next to Hillary smelling musty
Presidential pardon, name a nigger tougher than him
i will wait
I've been in my environment for like 20 years straight
Don't fuck my high, fuck my high
Nights like this could ruin a cake
Back off, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga has left
Back to this joint, smoking this shit like I'm trying to prove a point
Between you and me, turn the praise into urinals, angry niggas
Leader of the new school.
On tiptoe like a dancer, who knew Black Swan would be?
World in my palms, ironically
Niggas counted when I was 16
In the rice cart with six teenagers
Should have been in the pen
But now my pen writes with morphine
I heal niggas, I land with more demons
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to food ticket
They don't kill you in Las Vegas or a suburb
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
But I don't dry the tears, I just point them on purpose
Empty another magazine as bla
Let a young black man pass (Doot!)
I kill them all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I'm the bad, good God, the last thing the hood got
The last thing I would try to have a good job
If Shawn is a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo
Bitch see you at Woodstock ah!
I'm trying to get these hoes alone and this is my single
I bet I bring you dollas
Guaranteed girl, cut into slices like Kimbo
He appeared throwing signs at the ceiling
Drinking those 100 tests and I'm also dressed in Gucci
And these hoes prank a nigger so I yell "What is he doing!"
Where are you
Bitch I'm at the club with friends tell me what's good
I'm trying to get these hoes alone and this is my single
Where are you
Bitch I'm at the club with friends tell me what's good
I'm trying to get these hoes alone and this is my single
Move something, move something, move something
I have these stacks full of hundreds
With an icon woman on my left
My right, my right, my left, I am thrown
Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Can i pop my labels (pop my labels)
Can I play the fool (play the fool)
Can I swing my rag (swing my rag)
I'm a hub city maniac, bitch, get it right
Waiter, hurry up, put bottles on iceeee!
Bitch I'm at the club with friends tell me what's good
I'm trying to get these hoes alone and this is my single
I have a hundred dollas in me (I'm a rich bitch)
Baby I know you wanted (this dick)
Alright, it could be in some moccasins or Nikes
Faded blazer or white t-shirt
Either way she will like me
I get it for no reason
Looking, you see that ball like a student who is soft
And I can tell you that you don't have what I have
Which is a lot of juice, damn loot
Where are you
Bitch I'm at the club with friends tell me what's good
I'm trying to get these hoes alone and this is my single
Where are you
Bitch I'm at the club with friends tell me what's good
I'm trying to get these hoes alone and this is my single
I have a hundred dollas in me (I'm a rich bitch)
Baby I know you wanted (this dick)
I have a hundred dollas in me (I'm a rich bitch)
Baby I know you wanted (this dick)
So I say "What's wrong? What's wrong? Nigga, you made it"
So I say "What's up? What's up? Nigga, I hate it"
Frustrated and I'm riding through the back streets
"Will I survive to make this hole in time?"
Black boy flies, black boy flies
Black, black boy fly, black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one who followed
I would live in the gym, we lived with grief
Total envy of him, made his dream come true.
His way out of Compton with more to accomplish
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
Vividly remember how victory points had hurt me
Because each basket was a reaction or a reminder
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us dropping classes, going nowhere fast
I stuck my head inside the study room, focused on math
The qualities they gave him was the shit we didn't have
Dug into his backpack and Coach Palmer asked about his endings
Meanwhile, his back was like a spine
We sing the same old song turning the vinyl
Eleven students were wrong
Focused on the NBA, we focus on some pattern
Black boy flies, watch that black boy fly
Black boy flies, watch that black boy fly
Black boy flies, watch that black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music by writing songs
Money laundering, homies pondering against
Schemes to earn a million even if they hurt you
War is the case and in case you were not alarmed
The city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn.
It's 2004 and I hear people roar
By the name of The Game, they line up in front of the store
Swap knows, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, "Oh shit, wait."
I don't want to be another nigga caught regretting mistakes
My opinion was mixed feelings, I was defending my insecurities.
Relaxing my conscience with a villain
So as I go through these lottery tickets
I see a Harley Davidson truck visit the same plaza we bought
He was on top of the rap game, we were on top of the block
So watch that black boy fly
Black boy flies, watch that black boy fly
Black boy flies, watch that black boy fly
Black boy ...
My mom didn't raise me to be jealous
As most winners call it
That's what he said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from the microphone recording
The only way out of the ghetto, you know the stereotype
Shoot hoops or live on stereo like Top 40
And soon I was discouraged
Nigga, I was repeatedly rehearsing the phrase
That only one in a million will see better days
Especially when crime waves were bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces, you're just a typical homie
All these niggas are funny and they all stand by my side
Everyone will buy me a helicopter if any of you try me
What should I do when every neighborhood is an obstacle?
When two niggas who came out had never sounded logical?
Three niggas dating? That's an impossible mission
So I never believed the kind of acting I could do
I wasn't jealous for the talents they got
I was terrified that they were the last black boys to fly out of Compton
Thank God...
Hard dick like rottweiler
Can you control it? Can you control it? Woo woo, woo woo
The entire industry has been in ruins
All fleeting, I'm just changing the channel
Kendrick Lamar, the people's champion, I am an animal to analysts.
Verse detrimental to the race, meditating with burning candles
I like my extra prolific raps
From freestyle to lunch tables and park benches
And I won't mention my 10,000 hours in training
While juggling gangs, my balance was tremendous
And now we see the competition as a quick presentation
They take advantage before we have a chance to lose them
You see that my oath is very unbreakable, my style can never be confused
I can see them all unable
To be the presenters of God, you know me well
Ridiculous, poisonous, hate in my heart, the sinister
I'm rolling deep in that paper like two Adeles
Before scholars, it flowed stronger than virgin lips
We are here to rock the game and you are flying through the turbulence.
Everything is at stake today, this is how it was played today.
It is like an 8 ball in the face today.
They are seven figures and a preview for the case today, I am talking
More power, every two hours from Eddie Bauer
From storage boxes and lead showers, breaking the padlock
And the coward died dying a thousand deaths, whole lion
Surround yourself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit ah!
This is what they want, I'm the one
This is vintage from 1980 something
I am the son of the pioneer who brought you closer to the sun
Play with him, bitch, you better vote for Donald Trump
I'm yelling at Mr. Kanye West for president
He probably let me into the residence.
Abandoning Dropout, God Bless Americans
Nothing more influential than rap music
A locomotive could not locate me in my career
A bitch right out front, boy, what have you done here?
D-Bo, a whole year, Mississippi to California
It gets annoying, niggas wanna deplore it
And bitches want to worship him, but the industry shit is not for him
Probably thinking it's for him, just one for me
I swallowed the key and kicked the door, never leasing my foreigner
Mr. Valevictorian studied the game before they did.
Listen to them with boredom, baby rappers, abort them
A hundred thousand in my fortune, they call me back in the morning
You're competing against the turtle, calm down, it's important
Tie me up with the wisdom of my huge player
Jimi Kendrix acting, this damn haunted studio (Ah!)
I tell a bitch not to sweat me (don't sweat me)
I kill all this fucking rhythm if Cole leaves me (Please Cole)
Ib should never have shipped the instrumental
Every time I start writing I get sentimental
This shit is not fair
But why the hell do I care?
Two young stars were born and all will die here
Oh lord i gotta be the yam
Billboard list needs 2Pac, damn
But number 9 makes sure he's still alive, yeah
Every day a celebration, but even the valley reaches me
It's not validation, nigga this TDE
And my puppies will be salivating, wages, better grades
Whoa
Murder my accusations and burn my fingerprints
Sorry, they are not related, this party is reserved
I kill all this muthafucking beat if J. Cole says so
My nigga Ib cut the instruments, I have to kill him
I have to quit, I have to show you motherfuckers that I shouldn't play with
Whoa
Burning my leather
(Nah, I'm just fucking around)
(Know why I'm going easy)
Wait
King of my city, king of my country, king of my country
King of the unclean, king of the fallen, we live again
King of shooters, looters, reinforcements and poppin 'ghettos
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watching
King of culture, king of soldiers, king of bloodshed.
King of wisdom, king of the ocean, king of respect.
King of the optimists and dreamers who go and get it
Winner district king and geniuses with conviction
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the homeless
King of empathy, you resent me, king of remorse
King of my enemies, let defeat fall, I'm glad
King of the skyscrapers, dodging the haters, broke the religion
Nine faces, go against them, I erased them with precision
I hug them with a collision, the kings did it
A million tears fell
I know various responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards, but I live the old-fashioned way
The lens I'm looking through
He won't prescribe the correct lenses, the masses are now free
Ashes that I'm throwing, about to scatter all the crossed seas
Sisters and brothers in unison, not by me.
Because we don't stick with the opposition, we stick with the peace
But it would still ruin your organization if there was beef
What do you represent?
Are you an accident? Are you on the way
Your mother tongue contradicts what your body language says
Are you a king or are you smoking bowls to keep yourself open?
The king does not lie, the king gives heart, the king passes, the king does not fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
I am T'Challa
Jay, I've been ready
They say patience
Everyone wants to know why my game plan is so strong
Nigga like, I sleep and shit rapping; I never relax, I've been busy since I was born
"Are you really fucking with Sean?"
I answer, "Your choice, it would take a tool."
Dolce Brown Nigga, I'm right now, you don't have to wait later
Where's the CD? Put it on the record player
Tell him how to go, I do it like no other
The definition of a "young son of a bitch" with a problem returned
"West Coast Future" I am
And that's really hard
Southern California, Angeles, AKA LA's Chucks
Make comparisons when I saw him bend down
Man you think "What was it to Pac and Big before?"
I picked up a pen and when I did, my thumb and forefinger ached.
And then I started writing with it
I found it flows better, like a seashore at Venice Beach
It is cut from a different fabric.
It's cool, boy, but I'm a different frost
Like igloo, every time I go out
They hang on the wing of that G4
30,000 feet and it still won't fall
Because you do that?
Why did you have to sell that store?
I can't wait when it's my time (I'm coming)
No, I withdraw it, because I have time (I'm coming)
I know patience is virtue
But with that said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (no lie)
I can't wait when it's my time (my time)
No, I withdraw it, because I have time (I have time)
But with that said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (no lie)
When the lights go dark
And every calm body, I know it's my part
I could start a riot
The main event
I never played the bank
Star Point Guard
Never let money go by, I'm a pig
Touch everything I have in my hands, pushing like Ray Charles
I never had flaws
"Ooos" and "Ahhs" after each bar
Take your bitch and then give it back
For no reason, just because you will act hard
And I have some plastic under my belt, so rest assured
You don't want your moms to think about pulling the hospital wire
I went from a Honda Accord to a Bentley Azure
The back seat has a flock of girls
And I don't have to say kiss it, like "Sure"
Use Terrific, Easter Brum ????????
Who said that a veteran can not be so young?
I sound better than half already
Damn K. Dot, let me see your arm
I don't have to do a show, my jewels act
I don't have to do a show, my jewels act
Princess cut looks stupid fool
Eyes closed, all I see are dollar signs
And I won't have enough until I lie down on the grave or handcuffed once
It's not a lie
I can't wait when it's my time (I'm coming)
No, I withdraw it, because I have time (I'm coming)
I know patience is virtue
But with that said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (no lie)
I can't wait when it's my time (my time)
No, I withdraw it, because I have time (I have time)
I know patience is virtue
But with that said, you can't time beef, or I'll hurt you
No lie (no lie)
Eight doobies in the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, black, fuck it
Two pills and a half weight, nigga, fuck it
Man I swear my nigga is going crazy
Pick it up, then put it in cold water
I hope that takes away the pain
For the feeling you felt today
You know, when you're part of Section 80.
Because you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm at the house party stumbling
My generation takes cough syrup like water
There are never pancakes in the kitchen.
In the daily superstition that the world is about to end
Who cares? We never listen
'Less comes with an 808 (a tune and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drink (technology bought my soul)
Looking around and everything I see
It is a great crowd product of me
And they're probably relevant relatives to a rebel's dream
Purple label on the back, but that tab is light blue
She takes it straight to the head
So she looks at me, she has A.D.H.D
Eight doobies in the face, fuck that
12 bottles in the case, black, fuck it
You have a high tolerance when your age does not exist
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(I don't have a limit, just give me a little more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa
(I don't have a limit, just give me a little more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me that A.D.H.D did it)
And then she started ...
And then she started to feel herself
Like no one else in this department
"Sorry?" "Oh, I rap, baby."
"How old are you?" She says 22, I say 23
"Okay, so we are crack babies."
"Damn, why do you say that?" She said, "Where's my drink?"
"I'll tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax."
I stood up, closed the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Done behind where she resides
Then he said, "Read between the lines."
Yeah i hope i get close enough when the lights go out
And the fact that she could open up
The two of you really in the mood now
It's nothing we can do now
Someone came in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
Then he grabbed it, then said, "Make them understand."
"Do you know why we crack babies?
Eight doobies in the face, fuck that
Two pills and a half weight, nigga, fuck it
You have a high tolerance when your age does not exist
Like whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(I don't have a limit, just give me a little more with it)
(I don't have a limit, just give me a little more with it)
Whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa
(They always told me that A.D.H.D did it)
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Is it evil?
Is it weakness?
It's up to you
Are we going to live or die?
So I was taking a walk the other day
And I saw a woman, a blind woman
I grazed up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a little frustrated
As if I had dropped something and
Having a hard time finding it
I decide to go and lend a hand, you know?
"Hello madam, can I be of any help?
I think you have lost something
I'd like to help you find it. "
She replied "Oh yes, you have lost something
{Gunshot}
Is it evil?
Lamar expressed his views on police brutality
With that line in the song, he quotes:
"And we hate the popo, we want to kill ourselves on the street for 'sho'."
This is a public service announcement.
We call it Blood Sport
I also had to make one, sorry! I am a competitor
OMG it's about to get horrible
I hope you niggas know your story
Homie go ask Doc (talk about me)
Homie go ask Nas (and he'll tell you)
Homie go ask Jay (young boy)
But when you ask everyone (don't be jealous)
Or wherever you stay
Call me Bruce Willis
Don't call me lieutenant tinted glass on the black benz
So they only see him late at night like Jay Leno
I fuck twice your girlfriend told you we can't fuck
No she lies
You abuse the game, you challenge
Disobedient students need attention
Have a conference with parents. I'll be there. Just tell me what kind of class my son is in.
I'm recording Dwyane Wade
You like Kobe Bryant more without endorsements
That's like Shaq on the free kick, nonsense
I am equivalent to Earl Boykins, Spud Webb, Muggsy Bogues
I guess I handle the rock well
I make hoes like Stockton and Malone: choose and then roll
The ugly go to Sam Cassell
You washed like Nick Van Exel.
Let's dig into these NBA stats
My team kind of like the retro Celtics
Which means I am the equivalent of Larry Bird
The way I make a verse, he handles the ball
In the same way that I handle it without a pen
I call Jay Rock when I want to get him out
He hit like Vince Carter when he first saw the NBA court
Alley oop the court let him do whatever he wants
Explosion. Aw fuck, let's talk more sports
How about soccer?
I ran the game as Walter Payton in 1984
I pass you niggas like Peyton Manning
Play the field as Ray Buchanan
When I kick him like Morton Anderson, it's scary
Hip-hop cops on me I dodge them like Barry
Sanders ... John Madden saves your comment
Keep the cameras on I'm primetime like the '95 Deion
Should I continue?
Aw fuck let me go on
I'm going to do it like the '97 T Owens
It's not the we07 T Owens
You guys need to work on your defense, I train like Warren Sapp over the weekend
Let's go baseball now '94 Ken Griffey
The fact of a man's list is the Mike Plaza '96
LA MVP, call the doctor
My assumptions occurred to me, I must be rap ESPN or something
It is time to report halftime
I know you're good with the right but you're still not nice until you do it with the left hand
You're not nice until you play all the positions
I have tickets to the game of the stars, for the professional bowl game, girl bring a friend
I'm going to put you in, I'm going to take you out, I'll hit you
Drip my balls to the floor once
I'm the Jeff Gordon of the recording.
I'm Tony Hawk if I was skating
I'm Michael Irv before the cocaine snorted
Aw fuck, I'm what is always important
You niggas run out of time to get you together, man
I'm here
Hey, hey, hey, hey Moose what I gotta do boy
All those days on, all that's left on
I don't keep it, I won't be here for that
All those days on, all that's left on
However, I don't keep it, I won't be here for that
Blood on my hands and it looks like candy
I pay them lawyers and the microphone can't stand me
Ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
I have lood in my hands and it looks like candy
I pay them lawyers and the microphone can't stand me
Ya-yah, turn me on, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
Ya-yah, ya-yah
You know what kings do, lie down and stack at the door
This is what kings do, the vacation lands in Egypt
This is what kings do, hit Dubai in one night
And this is how kings move, hoe your money and invest wisely
A move from the king, keep it quiet, no one else dies
It's what kings do, that's how a king moves (What's wrong, son?)
Blood on my hands and it looks like candy
I pay them lawyers and the microphone can't stand me
Ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
I have lood in my hands and it looks like candy
I pay them lawyers and the microphone can't stand me
Ya-yah, turn me on, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
All those days and all that's left on

All those days and all that's left on
However, I don't keep it, I won't be here for that
Blood on my hands and it looks like candy
How I pay and pay lawyers, and nobody can bear me
Yes Yes
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
Yes Yes Yes Yes
I have blood on my hands and it looks like candy
How I pay and pay lawyers, and nobody can bear me
Yes yes (turn me around)
This is what kings do, talk on paper and skate
You know what kings do, lie down and stack at the door
This is what kings do, think about flying a Persian, yeah
This is what kings do, vacating land in Egypt
This is what kings do, breakdown plans with speeches
This is what kings do, hit Dubai in one night
And this is how kings move, me, save your money and invest wisely
Whether you sell buttons or select cakes
A move from the king, keep it quiet, no one else dies
All Pharaohs and Cameros flexin 'S5s
It's what a king does
How I pay and pay lawyers, and nobody can bear me
Yes Yes

Smoking, spilling, keep that tilt in my cup
All my car has leather and wood on my hood, we call it money
Everyone wants a ball, holla on broads in the mall
If he gets up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with all of you
(Pussy ass ho niggas) I can't fuck with you
(Bitches in my business) I can't fuck with you
(Counterfeiting industry) I can't fuck with all of you
Taking off when you land
Bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
And I'm dancing on them stars
The galaxy has no room for all of you
Nothing is going to happen soon for all of you
While I'm here and every day I listen
Your shit, self-pity
Reason why you never dealt with me
Reason why your girl dealt with me
Hands up, in the building, we take care and say
D.E.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yes
D.E.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yes
A to A to L-I-Y-A-H, take it twice
So give it back immediately, don't explode
Smoking, spilling, keep that tilt in my cup
All my car has leather and wood on my hood, we call it money
Everyone wants a ball, holla on broads in the mall
If he gets up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with all of you
(Pussy ass ho niggas) I can't fuck with you
(Bitches in my business) I can't fuck with you
(Counterfeiting industry) I can't fuck with all of you
Look at my life and then look at yours
Time will never wait on any man
Society will never take you by the hand
Blacks like gossip like bitches
It made me think you don't like bitches
I wonder what's behind them Ray Bans
Coward's eyes, I understand
Sip Dom Pérignon, when we finish, we say
D.E.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yes
D.E.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yes
That's exactly what it sounds like
But I will never forget the left eye
Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky
And a button on your lips, don't explode
Smoking, spilling, keep that tilt in my cup
All my car has leather and wood on my hood, we call it money
(Pussy ass ho niggas) I can't fuck with you
(Bitches in my business) I can't fuck with you
Now they all sing this shit
I am sending you a four page letter.
And when I write to you, better
Look at my life and look at yours
Get some ambition why are you bored
D.E.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
D.E.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
Witness
Watch me come in as junior club assistants
The roof recedes like it's vintage
The young man returned to burn your village, the fire touching the ceiling.
What does God want when HOVA retired?
Now come back, I guess you have some competition on your hands
Who is that? I am...
You can't categorize me
I'm already convinced that I'm the hottest nigga
Any comment? I thought so
You niggas are gassed like ALCO
Fear of playing Madden in All-Pro
I'm here to screw up the black barcodes
SoundScan will never read your albums again (whoo!)
The last one left are your moms (and even she doubts you ...)
There is nothing gifted about you
I'm about to send it right there, the shark food
The piranhas approach, I set the rhythm for the rap guys
I don't expect rap guys
Nigga NASA couldn't reach my altitude
The sky is the limit, and your body is not in the air ...
It is? Are you?
My real niggas, once again it's on
I kick the destruction and when I'm done
My city is cheating on you, it sounds like ...
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!
When the horns touch, I go
I told you Rock, I also like red
But you gotta kill these niggas out of nowhere
They don't see it coming
Who is not part of the family tree?
We travel like an ant colony, can't you tell us
Drink Henny until my throat is choking
New Benz, no malice
Count the money until our hands go numb
Caliber 40 at the Cavalier, welcome to Los
Angels, can you go with bandages
Real life, without mannequin
You take off, don't panic, you better shoot
Or that something falls on the roof, without raindrops
Without a magician, without magic, POOF
Closed coffin fatal attraction
Son 3 hit you like John Paxson, I'm not lying
Veterans have been loved
Speaking of bars, I have a life sentence
No man gets the best of him
In my opinion, why the rap?
I'm just losing my breath
It's all over, the end is here, so I'm taking steps
Try not to remember what I know
These pregnant dates mean, they give life as semen
I know the reason my heart is bleeding
I am coughing up blood on my palms as I recite the book of Psalms
On slow applause and hype, wisdom
Pay your tuition, this verse is like a college degree
They don't hear me, they fear me like a prophet of the end of the world
When I'm focused, nothing under the moon can stop it
I leave you off the surface of the Earth, that's what you get
This is not a verse, this is a Kennedy curse
My real niggas, once again it's on
I kick the destruction and when I'm done
My city is cheating on you, it sounds like ...
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!
When the horns touch, I go
Torch in hand, yeah, I'm running
My real niggas, once again it's on
Until we load the ammunition and drop the bomb
I kick the destruction and when I'm done
My city is cheating on you, it sounds like ...
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!
When the horns touch, I go
Torch in hand, yeah, I'm running
Swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the rulers apologize, you're not ruling shit
I'm Rick Rubin in '85 with a thick beard
Thick bitch type Peruvian eyes inclined crisscross
Sun down or sun up
Son, I son niggas
I probably fucked your mom
Without condom
That's good pussy fuck
Tell your honor
This trauma is Jeffery Dahmer
Being ambushed or kicked with brooms
Look man, your man looks like fresh water
Corn bread that breaks under pressure when caught
And if I passed my mouth, they would cut my legs
I'm just a young boss in the batcave
Against the wall
I went back with them back pain
Tell them to put my name on a gymnastic ball
Ho, know my gym
And players not allowed
I'm nailing your play towel
And shooting your Gatorade with gasoline, I'm disgusting
I'm in the crowd like Artest and they
Punchlines means I really go and hit civilians
Crisis time means I take it to the hole
Not a basket, but this nice pussy I'm in
I kill you niggas
I make your weight shape slim
Blank ribbons in your deck
You can still break their necks
I need to settle it with the bank just to spend
The appearance of the club goes through twenty-five scenes
When you have it like that, shit, it has to be a sin
So Lord forgive me, yeah I'm a sinner
But these hoes are with me cause I'm a winner
When we ate canned food for dinner
I trained fools to protools to make my schedule
I'm tofu, I'm nasty like tofu
I wish a motherfucker did it
Nigga, that's assault with a deadly weapon
I killed your favorite rapper
Last album of the favorite rapper
I fucked your favorite actress on the mattress
What a bless
Make the pussy go up
I'm really not impressed with
That some of you niggas blessed with
The gift to carry the presence.
I'm doing great shit with investments in labels
Fifteen minutes lasts fifty seconds
Last night, I spent twelve hours in a session
I came up with shit, writer's block
Niggas in this dressing like
"Who the hell cares? Who the hell cares?"
Even when you are Slumdog, you will still be a millionaire
Nigga playing Santa Claus will make sure you have deer
Get him to put that bitch in a hearse first while he runs Rock
Church for you pussies
You push me, they smear you pap
Explode your cookie
I read it, my fortune is here
See, this is that shit that makes real niggas grab their cocks
And bitches rub their tits
Monkey, look what the monkey does
Jump on a tree, shit on you
Shitting bricks that can build a castle
No problem breaking your fence
Learn about the pterodactyls that still exist.
And applaud if you resist
And you are at risk
You wear a bracelet, we want your wrist
You can try it from the planet Pluto
Lost, you panic like a poodle
Two Door regal, El Caminos and two more
Because I [???]
Wipe it on my shoe, ho
Before [???] your menthol
Intended to be smoked and then shipped
To jamaica
No trace of a Laker with Toni Kukoc
Means there is no hood
Jumping California JACO
See how the last prince of Snoop collapses
Bitch, start popping fireworks
* Fragment letters *
... is always right
And I love your mother, she's the reason we're both alive
That's right, my little butterfly, butterfly, you have a long way to go
Honey, just take it easy
It is what is inside, that heart that follows the love in those veins.
I still see Johnny ...
My little brotha, we evolve, we evolve as
Butterfly, butterfly, you have a long way to go
I want to hit line units ...
Do you want to lose weight and keep eating ...
Now I grew up in a litter box, next to you and her
For a baby to be like you, I wonder what that is worth
I wonder if you ever knew you were a role model for me.
The next day, I woke up in the morning, I saw you on the news.
I looked in the mirror and realized I had something to prove.
You told me: "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is fun now because all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I execute it (Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit!)
And I execute it (Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit!)
And I run it (Yeah! Hit!)
And I run it (Yeah! Hit!)
That is ironic (Knock! Knock! Knock! Knock!)
Ironic (Knock! Knock! Knock! Knock!)
That's ironic (Y-Yeah! Blow!)
Ironic (Yes! Hit! Yes!)
Salt everything in my wounds
Just for you, Mothafucka, I hope everyone has fun
And I execute it (Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit!)
And I execute it (Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit!)
And I run it (Y-Yes! Hit!)
Liberation ... Leader ...
Popular cake plant pictured here ...
Wile E. Coyote! Wile E. Coyote!
Remember when I had an appetite in the morning
Apple Jacks and after that I got to the TV Guide
Animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
I'm a maniac when I take aim at the enemy who lied
Tell a story that I will never grow to 25
Don't worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria.
No one is going to tie your shoe
No one will follow your rule
No one holding your gun
How come your tongue says "killa" and then kills my mood?
Speed of light living in the world you know
The old me, feeling like a live wire
Until I sink into a pole, like the right to vote
I'm from the bottom of the jungle
When you get a new chain, nigga take it away
Things we will never learn soon
In the era where we want to win soon
You all can suck my dick
All those days in the county building.
I'm about to enrich my mom
Cartoons and (Cereal!) I haven't felt this (Good since then!)
Scrooge McDuck (Here we go!), Primary Hood Crap
Now I grew up in a litter box, next to you and her
You held the gun, she was giving birth
For a baby to be like you, I wonder what that is worth
I wonder if you ever knew you were a role model for me.
The next day, I woke up in the morning, I saw you on the news.
Which is fun now because all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I execute it (Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit!)
And I run it (Yeah! Hit!)
That is ironic (Knock! Knock! Knock! Knock!)
Ironic (Knock! Knock! Knock! Knock!)
That's ironic (Y-Yeah! Blow!)
Ironic (Yes! Hit! Yes!)
Salt everything in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my songs
Just for you, Mothafucka, I hope everyone has fun
And I execute it (Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit!)
And I execute it (Hit! Hit! Hit! Hit!)
And I run it (Y-Yes! Hit!)
And I run it (Yeah! Hit!)
That's ironic
This shit makes a nigga I just wanna shit on everyone
Careless aim to a noisy mouth, discharge
Discard any business of yours
That your ass couldn't charge when the shit bounces
Everything comes apart, niggas are going to flip that car
AK for the whole hood
Lick the house fell perfect
Two shots to the head he deserved
I heard he hit my bed with a bowl and remote control
Dark Wing Duck lost service
Mom said I better bend down, she's nervous
I mean, don't step in without a machine gun
This block continues to shake, the feds lie in wait
As I did?
Well let me tell you so
Cartoon and cereals
Now I grew up in a litter box, next to you and her
You held the gun, she was giving birth
I wonder if you ever knew you were a role model for me.
The next day, I woke up in the morning, I saw you on the news.
I looked in the mirror and realized I had something to prove.
You told me: "Don't be like me, just finish watching cartoons"
Which is fun now because all I see is Wile E. Coyotes in the room
And I run it
Salt everything in my wounds
Hear my tears all in my songs
Let my life be lost in this cabin, just for you
Muhfucka, I hope you all have fun!
I did wrong, karma came
Cookies gave me ball and chain
State, powered, both can hang
No one can silence me
But I never said no one can shoot me
Just another stat for whites
I still work whip the white yolk, absolutely!
Every day it feels like the last
Hunt the money, don't hunt the ho
If you do what you always did
So you get what you always have
Silly jesters!
I haven't seen the back of my eyelids
During the last 72 hours.
Hand on my heart, face the hood
I promise every word you heard was honest
No cameras, no lights, just pain
Mom, how much trauma can I bear?
Dirty money comes with a lot of stains
The road to wealth comes with many lanes
I never had shit, I have a lot to gain ...
Just another player with a lot of play
I never had shit, I have a lot to gain
(To be continue)
I also had a lot of screaming for that shit, and that's random, but so what? Haha
Give me that silly heartbeat, this is a full time cat
I came back with a loot full time
And the critics thought they had me
No, I just bought more batteries
Supercharged shutdown, a medium far from living large
Where are my bitches knitted with them?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you screwed with the wrong one
Of the blood niggas fucking me, crypt niggas tryna kill me
It is a legitimate reason why
My heart to heaven, the rebel of the reverend
They're married to the game, well I'm about to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you're going through something, this is the shit you recite
This is bigger than life, this is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix's guitar on tour, bonjour, I mean a war like that!
Yes, that direct
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (Once)
You'll never know when I'm gone (twice)
On behalf of the conglomerate Top Dawg, it will remain anonymous
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me, she will fuck the homies ... Homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga, my nigga Tony said
"Just you, nigger!" Sample and test, black
And they will play you a fool, that's for sure
Until they know you have the stinky stool, black!
Back in the city and going around in four hoes
That boy has a cold, he's sick, crushed
Dropin red jewelry like a mitzvah school bar, ooh
Directly like this
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (Once)
Why do they complain about OGs?
No Snoop, no Dre, no Ice Cube
I look in the mirror and do it myself
Do I need a Dre or Jigga co-sign?
But do I need them? I just need a flow
The kind of shit that makes you think you've seen Pac's ghost
"Me against the world" in you mothafuckas
Uhh, try to record my steelo
Even when I'm not there like TiVo
And the grass is moving slowly right now but E goes
You know what I'm talking? I look at your Audemars
Just say hi, grab a flute and take out the wine, ooh
So
I need the world to celebrate me! (Once)
You'll never know when I'm gone (twice)
Looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where is she from? No I.D. (That girl is an alien)
The UFO flies away (so come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
She started me up, I'm all inside
Fifty stories, I'm falling
Where have you been? Is it the planet Mars?
Far beyond the stars? Are you martian
You are not familiar but still I feel you
Energy sending me to the ceiling
I'm high now, are you up there?
If it were, I'd climb any other ladder
And I'm impressed, nobody compares
Every contest in America when you were young
Lips, hips, hair falls down her back
(Crazy) Body Frame (Crazy) Crazy (Crazy)
The only girl who can make time
Then do me, to ...
Looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where is she from? No I.D. (That girl is an alien)
And if I die before waking up, I pray to be in outer space
The UFO flies away (so come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
So now we go on, so now we go
We make it sweet, they look bitter
Watch her get up, I hear them say
But why him? I hear them hate
I laugh at it instead of hitting it
Then continue life as a crack addict
Because I'm addicted, and you do the drug
Cold turkey? No sir
You definitely know, I probably have to give up
Lips, hips, hair falls down her back
(Crazy) Body Frame (Crazy) Crazy (Crazy)
The only girl who can make time
Then do me, to ...
Looks better than Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Halle Berry, Miss Jolie
Where is she from? No I.D. (That girl is an alien)
And if I die before waking up, I pray to be in outer space
The UFO flies away (so come on, come on, come on, come on, come on)
You are something different, I'm glad I found you
So pretty, I will never do anything to hurt you
I would like to thank everyone for coming tonight
I would like to share with you my celebrity scenes
I promise I won't tell the girl
I can hold water, I promise
I have this girl named Meagan Good
Well, you could say that Meagan was bad.
She made her son feel good, even curled my feet
Now please don't go back to Jay-Z
It's a rap, I used to fuck Christina a while ago
Which one, Aguilera or Milian, both of them?
They did this little trick with their tongues.
Brandi likes to suck, she said she needed some practice.
Brooke Valentine likes to take it from behind
Face down, ass up, shit I love when she goes up
And if I screw, I swear I won't say anything
Now we can all be famous cousins
I promise, I won't tell anyone else.
I promise, I swear I won't say anything else
I promise, just take off your clothes, no one will know
Psychoanalyze
And about Vivica
I got away with it before 50 Cent started failing her
One thing I know, shit, I hope I'm not kissing her
Man she could blow like a torch
And dick without using a fork
She introduced me to Gabrielle, of course.
Union, I had it on my backyard porch
Legs rolling movie, action, cut
She looks at me like "what happened, get up"
Shit, I felt like I was lucky
I gave him my last name, Trina kept going
She fucking with Lil Wayne now
Okay, I'm not crying because of my criticism
But for now I am free, "can you lift your skirt?"
We can have lunch, then dessert
Now we can all be famous cousins
And if I screw, I swear I won't say anything
Now we can all be famous cousins
And if I fuck, I swear I won't say anything else
I promise, I won't tell anyone else.
I promise, I swear I won't say anything else
Psychoanalyze
And Bow Wow wants to see my cars away from home
Saw the burner in the draw and came out
Will Smith knows exactly what I'm talking about
I had the same altercations when dealing with Jada
Baby momma drama I start to fuck Fantasia
Nothing serious, he thought it was a favor
And Lindsay Lohan, made my shit stand up
Pussycat Dolls want everyone's fantasy
Like, I need help trying to fuck everyone
An hour later, that's when Amerie called
OK ma, "you don't have to be a demon for ding-a-ling"
I will be there, make sure Eva is there
I want to see them mixed
Remember that time in my house
Remember that time in bed
Remember that time on the couch
Remember that time in the chair
Didn't we all have fun?
As celebrities can we?
Now we can all be famous cousins
Now we can all be famous cousins
And if I fuck, I swear I won't say anything else
I promise, I won't tell anyone else.
I promise, just take off your clothes, no one will know
Psychoanalyze
Ridin 'with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild and reckless is how we live life
Pray we get to twenty one (one, one, one)
Oh we hit twenty one (one, one, one)
Oh ho ho ho ho ho
I'm glad that we were able to talk about his vice and his ills. There is an even more important topic I would like to discuss: the dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan era. Young men who learned to do everything spiteful. This is your generation. Live fast and die young. Who is willing to explain this story?

Genç, vahşi ve umursamaz, hayatı böyle yaşıyoruz
Dua et 21'imize ulaşalım

Onun kötülükleri ve günahları hakkında konuşabildiğimiz için memnunum
Tartışmak istediğim daha önemli bir konu var
Ronald Reagan çağının işlevsiz piçleri
Bu senin nesilin

In time you will learn that it is about you
In time you will learn that it is about you
80's babies don't know it, they don't know it better
There is nothing better with ignorance
Some of them male, some female
'member of the universe used to be innocent
Now they just look at us crazy as immigrants
Every day I wake up, I'm a sin again
I'm not a citizen, I'm just a Section 80 black.
Hand show, how many have been taking notes? Good. Leave everything on the table now. Vulnerability, this is your generation. Show, show your pain
When the sun falls from the sky
All I have is me on earth to do or die
A highway, an accelerator and tranquility.
Now that's the maximum
I go to the cloud, I go cloud
Once darling tell me you need me
I'm going cloud, I'm going cloud
We have not kept in touch
Fell into lust, where's the love?
My independence has tendencies of lack of confidence
I look at the corners like my new wife
Seductive as she wants to be, with her hands on my clothes
And fortunately, being in denial is not the case
Instead, I'm grabbing her waist
And every part of it is in good taste
I know your feelings hate
In fact, you think I'm ungrateful ... I know
It gives me the feeling that you might need some time to grow
When the sun falls from the sky
All I have is me on earth to do or die
A highway, an accelerator and tranquility.
I go to the cloud, I go cloud
Once darling tell me you need me
I'm going cloud, I'm going cloud
Twice baby tell me you love me
And every time I think of your touch
Adrenaline pump, give me that rush
I'm like a thief in the wind
I know she loves me more, but I go crazy for the Benjamin
And I lost a friend
Lost in the world of a young man from Compton
Who never knew love because love was never promised
I know ... selfish as I want to be
I need time to grow ...
When the sun falls from the sky
All I have is me on earth to do or die
Now that's the maximum
I go to the cloud, I go cloud
Once darling tell me you need me
I'm going cloud, I'm going cloud
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Look at all the shit I've been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Tryna reaches you every day, picks up calls
Say who told you that he wanted this door
To snap shut, I just wanted to blow off steam or
A lawyer, I can give you more
As soon as it comes out, yeah, every shelf is yours
The commissary is running out, I need help
Not too much, I rush the rest myself
If you know me then you know how bad I feel
Quisha proves me wrong, and she never came to visit me
And I heard he was fucking another nigga
And my niggas left me in the dark, blind
Mama just come back to me this last time
Men lie, wo, women lie
Men lie, wo, women lie
Men lie, wo, women
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Mom, take this damn block off
Please believe me, this is not easy by far
You forgot you're talking to your only son
'Member when you put me in that relay race
All I need is for you to give me the same support
Research saying that the same report
A witness could testify in court
DA says I make a deal, or take a loss
I'm not made for all those damn numbers
If you can't, open the phone lines
Mama just come back to me this last time
Men lie, wo, women lie
Men lie, wo, women
Men lie, wo, women lie
Men lie, wo, women
Look at all the shit I've been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
That is the day that the state had removed the locks
I could only avoid doing too much
Improving your own crutch
Look at your reflection, tell me who you see
Your destiny and what will be
Thinking that my only son has just died
Looking out the window, kicking the door
It is you they seek, they storm outside
I'd rather see you locked up than dead
Only you would say that I'm selfish
So before I take the stand and put this bible in my hand
Son let me say this
Men lie, wo, women
Men lie, wo, women lie
Men lie, wo, women
Look at all the shit I've been through
If I take you home, will you tell the truth?
Shout out to my nigga Shellcase for doing this beat for me too
That nigger looks like a praying mantis
Drunk a hard liquor, pouring bottles on bitches
Feeling like old Jigga, old Nas
Bombing everything from the streets to the internet
Wet the instruments
Shoot who? Shoot what?
You're not a busted shit, but a gum and a lump
Who do they want motherfuckers?
Drop a motherfucker, from the fucking bomb
It's a peanut for an elephant, put that nigger in the trunk
Lean on my pimp cup
Ridin '84, throw like a pot [?]
Hoes on my athlete like I'm from the ATL
Flip a nigger like an NBA mascot
Strip a black of his wave layer to his [?]
I got it from my grandfather, he grew up on Compton blocks
Every day they fade, like us in the barbershop
Bullies in the parking lot
Ooh, you're a fool if you bark a lot, without biting
How [?] To kill right
In front of your mom
Hold on tight [?]
Summer time, perfect for hunting ducks
And your women want to be in my house
With her ass out, she climaxes and then passes out
Like promotional flyers, K Dot is the most flying
Eat ten rappers a day, now that it's a hellish diet
Your girlfriend she all about me
Let's say you want to clean my dirty clothes
Bitch I'm K Dot and I keep it friendly
Pumping like a fist [?]
From professional black this is automatic rap
Have a seat, have a sandwich, we'll be here for a second
Armageddon could be here when I'm done praying for heaven to have a home
I am alone in my own galaxy
You'll never have a start with a dead battery
And they scream agony, when I write shit
Visions of a black man making windmills with a blow
Impact for ten years, I've been here before
Look, this is all premature
I start the war as an instigator
Chopper, they are cream gaters
On a Thursday, mix the vodka with the sprite
Better yet, roll the dice, watch me come up
He wants [?] With me, great, raise your gun
About Macklemore winning the best rap album
It is well deserved; did what he did, man. He got out and hurried up and smiled. Everything happens for a reason; the universe returns, this is how it works.
At the Grammys they snub him completely
I definitely feel like they should always have more culture there, no doubt, because we definitely stand out like any other genre. We are part of the world. We are part of the movement. So I think any award, including the Grammys, should always drive more hip-hop because it's music as a whole, it's not just about dividing different regions. Everything moves as far as sound and vibrations, and this is how it goes. And we are part of it.
I'm with this
Complexion (two steps)
The complexion does not mean anything (it is a Zulu love)
Complexion (two steps)
Everything feels the same (it's a Zulu love)
Dark as midnight or bright as the morning sun
Shit on your complexion, I know what the Germans did
Sneak (dissin ')
Sneak out the back window, I'm a good country nigga
I made you a cotton flower just to relax
You know I'd go far, you know I'm ten fingers down
Even if the teacher listens, covers his ears, he is about to mention
Complexion (two steps)
The complexion does not mean anything (it is a Zulu love)
Oh complexion (two steps)
Everything feels the same (it's a Zulu love)
Dark as midnight or bright as the morning sun
Dark skin, but your blue eyes tell me that your mom can't run
Sneak out the back window, I'm a good country nigga
I made you a cotton flower just to relax
You know I'd go far, you know I'm ten fingers down
Even if the teacher is listening, I have the world's attention
So I say something that is vital and critical to survival
Of humanity, if it's lying, color should never rival
Beauty is what you do, I used to be so wrong
For different shades of faces
Then Whit 'said to me: "A woman is a woman, she loves creation"
It all came from God, so you were my confirmation
I came to where you live
And I looked around to see more places for sore eyes
Complexion (two steps)
The complexion does not mean anything (it is a Zulu love)
Oh complexion (two steps)
Everything feels the same (it's a Zulu love)
You like it i love it
You like it i love it
You like it i love it
You like it i love it
You like it i love it
I need you to say what you think very quickly, beloved!)
Let me speak my Stu Scott, ‘forgive me on my 2Pac
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That's the real sadness, baby, like you know Jay's baby
You surprised me, you create more beauty in blue, green and gray.
All my solemn men in the north, 12 years a slave
12 years old, thinking that my shadow is too dark
I love myself, I don't need Cupid anymore
Enforce my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light doesn't mean you're smart, being dark doesn't make you stupid
And in the mood for them you look, he's not talking "Woo-hah!"
If you don't look beautiful on your complexion
Putting it in context is not complex
Find the air under the kite, that's the context
Yes, darling, I'm aware, there's no competition
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones have been blessed
No stress, jiggaboos want to be
I'm talking about days we have school watching movie screens
And raise your self-esteem
The new James Bond is going to be black like me
Black like brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And everything is beautiful to me
Call your magnificent brothers, call all the queen sisters
We are all on the same team, blues and pirus, colors are nothing
I don't see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of landmines, the hell on earth
Now everyone serenades Kendrick Lamar's new faith
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point of intention is crude
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses on us
And the chapter that said at 25 would live inactive like five in the morning
They storm your place while Kendrick is acting
And if they take everything, I know I have
Compton, Compton, there's no city like mine
Oh Dre, what about my nigga?
I'm still at it, take off the plastic, you can feel the magic
When I'm back in the back of my city, back in the 'bach
With a bunch of them hitting Dre Beats with me, look where I am
It's a conclusion when I'm done and I've come a long way from a hundred bucks a month
A hundred thousand in a day, bitch I'm from
Compton, Compton, there's no city like mine
So come visit the screeching tire, ambulance, police
Won't you spend a weekend at Rosecrans nigga?
Kendrick Conan nigga
Where you attack with your hand, on the cross and swear that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra screams fucks your position and makes you hold that
I'm trying to stay ashore like four stories
But I know Piru Crip floors and tattoos
Swarms me like a hive
Get on the G ride
From west to east
I pass the blunt then pass the torch of course that's my decision
I crash the Porsche and then you report that you see me in Benzes
I explode every time we throw a record
Depending on what you expect, I'm sure it's bigger than your religion
Compton, Compton, there's no city like mine
Roll it up, I'm going to take you to the next height
I did exactly what I wanted, that's what made them fly the checks
In my direction, you never questioned when I said that
I would be a tycoon before visiting 2Pac and the left eye
Eazy and Aaliyah when I see you we will try
A Lambo in the sky but for now I'm in my sights
Compton, Compton, there's no city like mine
We can all reap NWA rap artists
United States Targets Our Rap Market, Like Controversy And Hate
For coca cola traffickers, the rich bell
And the broken niggas that play
With them gorillas who know murderers
Roll that kush, crack that box, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker here says:
"Look who is responsible
For taking Compton International
Ayo Just Blaze, handsome friend
There's no city like mine, yeah
In Compton City
There is no city like mine
Mom, I can't use the van too fast!
Come back, 15 minutes!
I am so horrified, Louis Vuitton draws
Shit, a booth for me is a bathroom stall
If you're not fond of me, you're comedy, little Duval
I have many defects, I am human first of all
I get up in the morning, I smell some coffee, then I tell your bitch to get off me
Man that bad boy, man that boy spaz
Until it crashes like Sandra Bullock and Luda on the avenue
He changed his name, he was a conscious rapper
Naw mutha'fucka, I'm just Compton's rapper
I could spit out intricate shit so the retards don't understand
Is that a contradiction? Does it contradict itself again?
We don't like what Christ is like
We all want ice and gadgets for bitches to say I like this
People don't understand why I was left-handed
I can't be like Game, I can't be like Eazy
To get into this rap game, I know it won't be easy
Because my shit is different
I know
He from Compton, where is he from, has he killed before?
The truth is that I am not the most ruthless, but I am not a cupid
Before having two children, my mother worked two concerts
To get out of Chicago
To return to another ghetto, in Sante Fe playing the lottery
I used to want a two door Tahoe champagne
Until I saw the same truck fired at five o'clock
Dead with his eyes closed, everyone should have seen him
From a gallon of cough syrup, but the rifles had tipped it
That's why these tough rappers don't think so.
They all want to be, I want to catch bats and beat them
So they can feel the pain of the blocks that I'm from
Where my heart went numb
Get out of your chain, or get out of your life and have a fatherless child
It is the syllabus for the ignorant militant mind.
Sure sure
Kendrick Lamar's LP I've been promoting for about a month
Don't worry, it will come soon, like a quick walnut
They never gassed me, some labels passed
Now that the industry collapses, I guess they were unlucky
Are you bad, don't you write either? There goes another fashion
Shit, I write ether
I understand it like the Vanna on the Wheel of Fortune forcing your loss
With the strength of the main forces of four forklifts
This is scarier, this is Amityville
This is the exorcist on ecstasy pills
And if I can't do it, my integrity will
Main dog wishes, every Compton bitch is
I mean this shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Fucking ridiculous
Everyone has a fat ass but tiny tits
Now I have to mix and match, jungle fever, black and white
Double D, Brittney, Becky, keep your mouth intact
Man these pitiful hoes
Do you know how long it took me to cut this fucking beat?
All you do is hate shit
And if I don't say shit, they still say I'm not shit
And that's ridiculous
I mean that shit is
Fucking ridiculous
Yeah look i know i can make a lot of money doing this man
It's the whole process that uh ...
That I have trouble knowing what I mean
I know you well, you know
Put it in the jar and just look at it, it already knows how to bubble and all that
Blame it on him! (than?)
And my thickets in
I'm the chemist whipping you in the kitchen
This is not for children.
You need parental advice
First you negotiate store
Jorge a visit
I have it wrapped in saran
This is the man from LA
Unless it's a drought
So it's another place
Turn around south
Back to class
I hope you are taking footnotes
The class is in session
Get your instruments
Take a little baking soda, a triple beam, a beaker
And a hanger with which you can rummage
Divide nine Os in four ways into that 36
Place it on the triple girder
As difficult as it sounds, it's not that complicated
Say you'll get it baby, just be patient with me
Confidence before compliments
Now let's take care
This is the procedure
Place it in the beaker.
Your water should already be boiling
Grab a small cup and pour it
Rotate the hanger until it is paper thin
Place the hanger in the beaker and then go around your wrist in a circular motion
But wait, it gets tricky again!
As your hand turns
You're probably thinking it's safe
The muscle inside your arm is making your joints hurt
You're struggling at work, but don't lose faith
Wait ... you got it back smooth (good)
Now pour a little hot water into the beaker
Then pour a little cold water on it
That's when the drug should drop
Take the cookie out of the jar, take a pocket knife from the cabinet
Lay it on the cardboard, then chop
Are you excited that the chemistry worked
This is the devil's appetite
It's bigger than life
You turned to Mr. Nino Brown in one night
You should thank me twice
Although you learned from a chemist who never moved a brick in his life
Like most of you rappers
Aw, I don't believe that man
There's no way you've never done it before, you know what I mean
That was too descriptive
Uh, it's that Compton -ish
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin's Nights, (yeah)
Rollin 'says gangsta rights
Bell Tip, (right)
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin's Nights, (ad lib)
Rollin 'says gangsta rights
I'm back at it again
My city is back with them
Back against the wall, K Dot, they try to nail
But they can fuck with that pen
The shit I write is brighter than blue gems
You better stay in that gym
Exercise your mind until it's strong enough
Hold on to my roots like Black Thought and 'em
I'm black with Einstein's thoughts
A word that describes it, genius
What you know about the city where I live
Is living with the souls of the dead
You don't know about our living conditions.
But it's more than grass and women, gangsters, hunters
Bullet collisions, players, pimps
Who can imagine the place where I reside?
NWA had mentioned, Quik had the turntables mixed
The first to say fuck the system
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights, dude, that's Compton's life
Rollin 'says gangsta rights
Hood tip, buddy, that's Compton's life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights, dude, that's Compton's life
Hood tip, buddy, that's Compton's life
Geah, your own street like concrete
Would better describe your gutter
But look, I'm what's underneath
I'm from the land of organized crime
Messy peace
‘Cause today niggas rush when they order their room
And worship your weapon just like your religious beliefs
Compton's actions cannot forget the police.
‘Because in the hood I tell the pigs no more
Be the mark of the beast
And his main goal is just to talk about the streets
Let them go, watch them?
I had you to kill the road like an opossum
Niggas plant their seeds to be gangstas
Hoping that someday they will flourish
Com 'Cause Compton raised niggas and bitches we barely got' em
Unless you talk about the one with the attitude problem
We come back, that's for my people, it's official
Husslin nights, dude, that's Compton's life
Rollin 'says gangsta rights
Hood tip, buddy, that's Compton's life
Chevy lights, women you like
Rollin 'says gangsta rights
Hood tip, buddy, that's Compton's life
I don't know if he's new around here
It is good to meet someone if you are new around here
‘Because it is not too safe for you to navigate here
Blacks stick to your ass like glue around here
Take New Jersey and put it on whatever you don't care
It's not a magic trick if they make your shit disappear
The result is severe, and part of this coffin will last a day.
But I'm amazed because the young man has been here for years
I saw niggas shed tears of blood
I hope you don't try to plan for the future, niggas will silence you
Introduce you to the rugers
Clock like Tap Judah
Except for the actress and the producers.
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights, dude, that's Compton's life
Rollin 'says gangsta rights
Hood tip, buddy, that's Compton's life
Chevy lights, women you like
Husslin nights, dude, that's Compton's life
Rollin 'says gangsta rights
Hood tip, buddy, that's Compton's life
Yes kendrick lamar
This for the city, nigga
Caught up in a murder when his friend died, the judge caught feelings
I'm at Rosecrans, chilling out at Best Outlest
Elementary McNair, say what Vanguard is doing
Centennial High, made me swim with a shark pool
I'm just a good boy, I try to keep it neutral
But I am very aware that you can also shoot a square
Most Crip and some Piru, this is how the game goes
Bitches with fat asses, burning in hiding places
July murders, call that summer madness
I swear to God, when I make it big, your voice will be heard
I am just a good boy, I try to keep it positive
Compton, concrete jungle
There is nothing you can't do
Now you're in compton
These streets will make or break you
Breathe out or get inspired
Let's hear it on Compton
Earl had been disciplined for not having fainted that week
However, the shit had made him stronger, yeah, those were the old days
Eating Tam's burger while my youth CD was playing
21 off, maybe sideline pop
Yellow tape on the sidewalk, damn, someone showed up
Hoping to live long, I don't want to die young
Please don't come to my party, I just want to have fun
Sheriffs in my rear view, mother fucks the police
From the Compton Swap, Los Angeles Black and Red Gears
Pac was on nigga Rosecrans, he was there
Release my J-Dub nigga and the two J-Mans
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
I'm talking about Westside Piru, N.H.P., Campanella, Carver Park
Front hood, Nutty Blocc, Lantana, 151, Park Village
Cedar Block, Santana
Burgundy and blue scarves
Peace! Peace!
Fruit Town, Kelly Park, Southside, Elm Street
Poccet hood, ATF, MOB, LPP, 135, VTP
Atlantic Drive, Limehood, NHC, PBC
Peace! Peace!
Tragniew, Compton Raymonds, Tree-Top, Mona Park, T Flats, 7 Os, 155
Compton Marsh, Holly Hood, T-Zones
All a nigga really wants us to keep
Peace! Peace!
But shit, that takes some time and more time
But I'm pushing to get us there in no time
I am just a good boy hoping to spread love
(Outro)
E-S-T 1987, Hospital Domínguez, that bitch was on Bullis Road]
That pussy bewitched me
That pussy bewitched me
That pussy bewitched me
Hey lil pretty lil, pretty lil, I bless you
That pussy bewitched me
That pussy bewitched me
That pussy bewitched me
Greetings boys and girls (Greetings boys and girls)
My name is Petey P (My name is Petey P)
Kendrick's imaginary childhood friend (it's true, it's true, it's true)
Your guns pop and fireworks (and sing)
And sing (together)
When we grow up, we go find ourselves a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow like Coltrane, blow like Coltrane, yeah
Spend it all in front of the county building
Blow like Coltrane, blow like Coltrane, yeah
Kendrick, you remember that once when we were ...
I've been waiting for this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
I was at Rosecrans at that burger stand in '95
People looking at them in amazement
Reservations at Days Inn
We lived in a hotel at that time
Breakfast, lunch and dinner, Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Mama babysitting Section 8 vouchers the movement
When nothing else to lose except a burger job
I close my eyes inside the exchange meeting and imagine it's a mansion
Howling at the moon, what is a herd of hungry babies?
I hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rage
Every day we pray to eat at the Sizzlers table
But never visit, if better days were coming
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food burns
Oh yeah, I remember, it was- it was the ravioli with the hot sauce, right?
When we grow up, we go find ourselves a million
I'm right?
Oh!
Blow like Coltrane, blow like Coltrane, yeah
By the way, don't forget to sing, sing
When we grow up, we go find ourselves a million
Spend it all in front of the county building
And all the ghetto kids in the world say "that's my car" (Yes, oh)
All the ghetto girls say "that's my car" (Yes, oh)
When we grow up, when we grow up (Yes, oh)
The ghetto kids in the world say "that's my car" (Yes, oh)
All the ghetto boys say "that's my car" (Yes, oh)
When we grow up, when we grow up (Yes, oh)
Nigga, do you remember the smoke and the burning buildings and that shit?
The passenger played, I think it's five years after the eighties (Yes, yes, that)
Seven, do the math, ‘92, don't be lazy (I won't)
Like a flame from a trick candle, everyone has dentistry
Sure because we are about to use dental floss, do you get the sofa I sent you?
From a scholar but, shit, not today, Dayton Spokes was his.
Coolers, Grills & Kicks Jordan
They invaded while the helicopters recorded it.
Let's say you have me, if not, I'll look in your drawer
The exchange was the bull's eye like Taurus
"Dad, you're really telling me that we can get more
If we run out of it? "He said," Lil 'nigga, today the poor are rich
Don't tell your mother you saw a Molotov bomb
If she asks I just know you have to lie and son don't forget it
Bitches ain't shit, hoes ain't
Niggas gon 'snitch, look at the company you keep
And one day you will put money in the ghetto when you have it
Instead of having to chase these Rodney King riots off "
That's right, that damn Rodney King ...
When we grow up, we go find ourselves a million
That's crazy
Don't forget, he still sings with the children, he still sings
When we grow up, we go find ourselves a million
Please sing
Spend it all in front of the county building
Yes, Kendrick Lamar, tone what, take a look
As the day goes by, I let the rock beat
Then put my thoughts in the crib, hip hop
God the Father plants the seed, you should be my son
And if you hot niggas, I guess I'm the sun
I'm a bit removed from global warming, this is a warning
I listen to an instrumental and then I go to Norman
I'm always acting
As if it was my last morning
Before I sit down with the Lord and watch my mother cry
Ground level was never important when walking on land
He said he needed a verse, I blessed him with a couple of lines
Bear hugged some bears, fight with a pair of lions
Damn Kendrick Lamar
I repeat my city until I am off this map
Chillin 'on the bricks with bricks looking fifty
It's still in my blood, nigga, it's all natural
Welcome to L.A gangbang Capital, still rocking my colors, I had not sworn
I'm not a millennial baby, look, I was born in it
Bless the beat when I speak every time, cocaine bars that modify every line
Flow bolder than a cold in a polar bear, shhh I'm the one that these rap niggas fear
Lil Watts Lil Compton in the East Race
A natural rhythm
You have me like a savage and a beast
The rap game begins to seem like a pristine party
So listen when the package is complete
You got me spitting with precision
So the truest MC is what I am
You can vibrate with it or go back
These new shots turn black blue
With boom bap I proved that
Know that my Golden State affiliates can demonstrate that
On my fucking shit Long Beach Venice shit
Primitive how I created this, all the calligraphy
It's intricate, now go and turn on the sirens
My microphone is in the flow is causing violence
We are the best duo since Bo and Marcus Allen
Boo-boo, T'd
You rejected, you were thirsty
I'm trying to learn something new
I'm trying to find myself, I'm looking deeply for Kendrick Lamar
In existence, at that moment my dreams will be unlocked
And by the way, I'm going to start, finding more light to shed
Like a little garage in your backyard
I am back relaxing with a friend of mine, she is fine
But I notice that his heart resides alongside bitterness.
Who do you want to fight with, who wears a tissue
Who's the fake Dooney and Bourke bag, who's got the keys
And who needs a Pap test to make me nervous?
But before your negative energy curve, bitch, I'll cut you down
Because every time you come
You'll be screaming that whoop-de-whoop, bla-zay-blah
He says, she says, oh my god
Shut your mouth ... hoe
Every time you come
You'll be screaming that whoop-de-whoop, bla-zay-blah
He says, she says ...
I'm trying to learn something new
Or at least ask similar wishes
I'm talking about ideas, motivation
It's more to do, enemies, my nigga
Oh, isn't that your memo? So tell me why are you constantly stressed
On how you connected well as a centipede, my nigga
I run with you and flaunt your gun
Every second tell me how you pressed them on Monte Cristo
Where and from where, and which neighborhoods are winning
Who baby mom is a rat and who was killed last weekend?
That shit is depressing madness, knocking me down
Talk about something with some substance that can make us both pay
Instead of telling me how these niggas tease your style
Or your tires ain't bigger, nigga cunt, I'm gonna cut you down
You'll be screaming that whoop-de-whoop, bla-zay-blah
He says, she says, oh my god
Every time you come
I'm trying to learn something new
I'm trying to improve my chances of becoming a star
I'm trying to feel the Mona Lisa atmosphere
Studying art ... now paint that image
Life behind bars, remember the same day I was caught?
I murdered a rapper and you filed the police report?
Look what they taught me, family is all I need
But in fact, they can also take me to a tree
Constantly talking shit about the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I would never give up
Since Grandma died, everyone separated
Arguing on vacation, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid attention to her, except the mothers.
Yes my mom is as loyal as any sister would come
Dang, what if your blood didn't run through my veins
I would cut them too, yeah
They'll be yelling that whoop-de-whoop, bla-zay-blah
He says, she says, oh my god, shut your mouth
Keep running, Ali
Every time you come
You'll be screaming that whoop-de-whoop, bla-zay-blah
He says, she says
So tell them, "Shut up!"
Say, "Shut up!"
Yeah bitch, boo-boo, T'd
You came down, you are thirsty
Say "Shut up!"
Yeah nigga, boo-boo, T'd
You came down, you are thirsty
You are thirsty, boo-boo
You T, you got off
Boo-boo, T'd
Boo-boo, you get off
You are thirsty, T'd
Boo-boo, you get off
Boo-boo, T'd
You're weak, weak bitch
I- (laughs)
Your boo-boo, your T (laughs)
Save all of that
HiiiPoWeR is the way we think, the way we live
Look, today we know that the human race is nothing
Without morale, without standards
No you don't have to have a lot of money
But you will be rich in mind and spirit
Some say it is as big as a crew, some say it is as big as a gang
HiiiPoWeR, we stand up for it as big as a religion
Yes follow me huh
Imagine Kendrick, one of the great masters of ceremonies
Roamin 'the coast as cell phones in airplane mode
I've been at bat for so many years
Now I'm out swinging like open marriages
Take this terrorist flow, say I'm arrogant
Stop playing around, thinking about rhyming over computer microphones
I knew it was tight by the time the speakers broke
I dove in and got chronicles but never knew it was a drug
You see, my uncles are murderers, but I never knew that I could smoke
A rapper like a .357, makes worse enemies
Let me rip your underpants until I bite your ass
I'm Cujo, (you) sumo actor, (me) sumo rapper
Heavy on the game, follow my name, K-Dizzle
A dream of twenty two years, now I have
As a person or thing place definitely like 6:30
Give me respect, I hold it down for DJBooth.net
And they tell them that K-Dot has the neck
From your baby mom
In my mom, the brain like a genius
I'm traveling to Venus
Where aliens have round pistols, V-necks
Nose, Kleenex
I guess I took the artists somewhere
Where the deceased newspaper sleeps at
Competition falls short like a dwarf
Hand in hand, you're not ready, I'm deadly like plec disease
God given, you're stumbling, I've walked the Seven Seas
Moses, cold as his heart, cloned as art
Foamin 'in the mouth, wildebeests kill opponents
'About business when I kick this, ridiculous symphony
Central and Rosecrans, Compton does not breed killers
Raise Conans with survival tactics
Do you love drama? Welcome to the land of the theater.
Even a preacher packs up as role managers who damage their assets
Cameras roll around the hood, trying to get that footage
Even news anchors come to your block when you wouldn't
This is the city at its best, take a seat, hold your breath
Kendrick Lamar, K-Dot, i mean ha ha ha ha yeah
Go away, no cheddar cheese
Just a white t-shirt and swap sweater
But I can't win if I can't fix it
What do I have to do to see success?
Having the best in the world to call me the best?
Stop at the Grammy Awards as the Best Dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress?
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
Who does not want to fuck with a broken black with ambition
But the last time I checked it, you guys were bankrupt
Make a name for myself and then bubble like Buffy's ass
The friends on the block can say what they say
I don't want to be a murderer, I want to be a Gates
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Sample and test, prove that you are the one
It's not about who is the baddest
Who wants it more?
So just go out there and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
What do I have to do to see success?
Having the best in the world to call me the best
Stop at the Grammy Awards for Best Dress
With an address next to a beautiful actress
Busy ear in a black who brags constantly
Catch it in the light, get it out of your Jeep car
Or maybe I have to connect with José
Cop 5 yay bricks, head to the bay
Area or take the birds to VA
Let Clipse distribute the work all day.
Every three weeks turn three to six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't want to be a distributor, I want to be a win
Donald who is
In time it will come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Sample and test, prove that you are the one
It's not about who is the baddest
Who wants it more?
So just go out there and get it
(And when I do it I do it again
Then i come back
When I do it I do it again
Then i come back
Throw it away)
Go out and get it
(But for now I'm going to go to the head and get it out
I have a rhyme, rhyme)
Go out and get it
Welcome to the story of my life
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my mom and wife
But while you listen to K-D-O-T
Man, my girl and I split the KFC cube
She listens to Drake and all I can say is "Damn
Are these niggas much better than me, baby?
I don't think this should be
Because i'm always losing self esteem
He paused the iPhone and then said, "Eh?"
I repeated what I said and she replied: "Shut up."
And never listen to what the industry says
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black businessmen did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I have to see success, I have to step out of Rosecrans' footsteps
Climbing to the top like a shaken soda
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
I have, I have, I have, I have ...
I have power, poison, pain and joy within my DNA
However, I have hustle, ambition flows inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, act like this, Yeshua was a new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, after your damn head
This that puts the children to bed
This I got, got, got, got ...
I went down, I had a troubled heart inside my DNA
I only win again, then I win again as Wimbledon, I serve
You see fireworks and Corvette tires skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know who you are
Look, you're a, you're a, you're a ...
Bitch, your hormones change neatly inside your DNA
Daddy repented neatly, inheritance within your DNA
The spine does not exist, I was born out of a jellyfish, I calculate
See, my pedigree definitely doesn't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through, it offends you, this is Paula's older son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, reinforcements, thieves, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, dead parents with children and
Yes, yes, yes, yes, the DNA of the soldier (I am the DNA of a soldier)
Born into the beast, my experience was verified in second grade
When I was 9 years old, in the cell, motel, we had nowhere to stay
At 29, I did really well, hit the car wheel on my property
And I'm gonna shine the way I'm supposed to, anti-social extrovert
And excellent means extra work
And the absence what the fuck did you hear
And Nazareth is going to defend his case
The reason why my power is here on earth
Hail the truth, when the prophet says
I have loyalty, I have royalty in my DNA
That's why I say hip hop has done more harm to young African-Americans than racism in recent years.
I have loyalty, I have royalty in my DNA
I live a better life, I'm throwing several dice, fuck your life
I have loyalty, I have royalty in my DNA
Live a baby, fuck your life
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
You motherfuckers can't tell me anything
I'd rather die than listen to you
My DNA is not to imitate
Your DNA is an abomination
This is how you are in Matrix
And sleeping in a villa
Drinking from a Grammy, walking in the building
Diamond on the ceiling, marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, looking out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Dodgin 'paparazzi, cursed through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock with sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretching Nirvana
Watching all the snakes, bending all the fakes
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder: these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up at the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the road, murders on the road
Motherfucker, I have winners on the way
You're not shit without a body on your belt
You are not sick enough to pull yourself
You're not rich enough to go to the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction will be my destiny
It will be your destiny, it will be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder: our DNA
If I like it
Or does the feeling haunt you? (Den)
I know the feeling haunts you (Haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Tell me what are you going to do to me
Confrontation is nothing new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false trust
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people who feel entitled
Look at me crazy because I don't invite you
Are you the moral of the story? You endorsing?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
This is how you find out who you're dealing with
A small percentage that I'm building with
I want credit if I am losing or winning
In my mom, that's the most real shit
Love let's talk about love
Is it something and everything you expected?
Or does the feeling haunt you? (Den)
I know the feeling haunts you (Haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Love let's talk about love
Is it something and everything you expected?
I know the feeling haunts you (Haunt)
This may be the night that my dreams let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
Realization of the motivation in my DNA.
I have
Devotion and emotion in my DNA.
Yes we just want the prize
Woman arrested for undressing
Barrel directly through the peephole
Tell your parents we're home
Propaganda that we have
Crime infested, uncontested
Block and street zone conventions
My redemption will not be long (woman)
My religion, fear no man (arrested)
Warrior, Conan, oh man (to wear)
Horror and Romance Stories (Naked)
Kettles burning with sin in them
Children don't want to hold hands
Tourists don't want to visit and purists die in maulin '
Fire burning across horizons
Follow fortune through guidelines
Stolen Porsches and baby abortions at their highest
More divorce and child support attorneys calling you "Dada"
The feds touch their wifi (skrrt)
The drugs drive you crazy, you dip your head in a little water
Give it a dip while you drink it
Fuck it, turn on the stop sign
Duck a clip on that drive-by
Fuck a bitch in the slingshot
Sell a brick to a minor
Making wishes for Jannah
Raise your fist much higher
Welcome to the future of America, the great ruler (woman)
Public Enemy is the firstborn, ready to shoot you
I hate when people look at me
His eyes red as blood
Remembering them playing Sega with each other
I was hurt, I could see it, lots of tears, not Kleenex
I stayed by his side because that was my friend
I gave him a hug, some of his brother's blood caught me
I stood up, sat down on the sidewalk again and asked who they were going to hang out with
I wasn't sure, so I didn't answer him
But I was sure I had a blammer for him and I wanted war
Revenge, what do you say to a good friend?
Did you lose that and take the helicopters out of the closet?
But he said, "My nig, this feeling is more than personal."
I stopped
He got on a four-door Honda Accord.
Before folding the block, he said, "K-Dot ...
"... You would not understand"
(These streets can turn a child into a murderer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a threat.
Can anyone pray for me?
Or at least try to understand
(The pressure of the city
The AK-47, twins MAC-11
The Eagle shotty desert and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh ay)
Candles on the pavement, postcard read
Look, this was not in our plans
Put down that Malcolm X book and then upload that K
Look the devil in the face, from a healthy eye
Cast the spell on yourself as Akeelah and the bee
Every street killer is a teenager with a corrupt mind.
Substance, time, is no longer a problem
We don't have it, so pass the scarf
Then close the coffin, kiss mom when you can
And tell him you understand, but you don't understand
(These streets can turn a child into a murderer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a threat.
Can anyone pray for me?
And hopefully you'll understand
(The pressure of the city
The AK-47, twins MAC-11
The Eagle shotty desert and the Smith & Wessons
Pray for me, oh ay)
He said, "Period, I went to one, do me this favor
Drop these weapons in a safe place, don't let anyone see you
This is as critical as it gets, my nigga, I need you. "
I said, "Okay, what happened?"
I didn't care who he hit "
That's wild shit, but anyway, I got you
I woke up the next morning with a cold
Allergies made me sneeze and wipe my nose when it was leaking
I checked the medicine cabinet, looking for something from DayQuil
But all I saw was a little aspirin, just my luck
I walked to the parking lot, that's when I saw the faces of death
They said they were looking for my man, helicopter in hand
Praying would get stuck, but you don't understand
(These streets can turn a child into a murderer in minutes
Not by choice, but forced to be a threat.
Can anyone pray for me?
I'm telling you, do you understand?
(The pressure of the city
AK-47, double MAC-11)
Hey? Do you understand
It is like
Of which I have been a part
No, from what you get, from not writing your things on paper, you get more, you know the ... expression, the feeling of yourself. You know what you mean; Instead of reading a newspaper that sounds read, it sounds narrated. Unless you want to do it narrated ...
And real life situations were artificial.
They say we're only living to die
Imagine if we are already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross into the sky we are getting confused
Planet earth is like oceans 11, we are planning the getaway
When my childhood friends are sent to prison for their first crime
He's screwed but listen, we study God but we don't know him
Criticizing people who work on Sundays, two jobs just to feed their children
Because we are not going to win
(Shit)
Don't worry, I'm just thinking again
Thinking out loud, thinking the opposite of proud
Because I'm disappointed in myself sometimes
Self-esteem becomes lower than nighttime strippers
Difficult to motivate the right rhymes, inspired by real crimes
Turn it off and then come back the next day, it's here to stay
Fight that is
I am so in love with knowing something that is waiting after this life
You know he sees me pouring out my heart, hopefully soon
Wait a minute K. Dot! You said turn it on again, bring it back
If it was great for you to be a victim
Let's say I'm weird, but you obviously didn't get it when I said it the first time
You're listening too far if you listen to this part
I fast forward to the common thoughts of a human
Stick heroin needles into politics, this is crack music
O-pi-um, inside your veins, don't abuse
Capture every moment like a movie, shoot all my enemies on the move
Direct them to a coffin
Give them only if they ask, if they want ...
If you want to see reality [haha]
I'm losing you again, right?
Am I not the perfect candidate to represent all fifty states?
Black President, they don't want to see that
It's obvious ... pain is pain
I swear to God we live in a womb
Kanye, West Coast niggas do it better
We learn to live with it, I guess
I mean to die with that, since we are already dead
Trying to cross to heaven, that's what I said the first time
Get it? Now little one, I have to sit you down
Teach you about the things we live
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away ...
When dreams were reality and money was love
What would we do for a buzz to maintain our sanity?
Chasing the wind, fighting for this vanity
American Dream or Scarface Fantasy
Kilos of coca and the arms of black families
We wear it, our hearts covered in stone
A mother's dreams for her baby to come home
Cause he's pushing that chrome, chasing that cash
Ending other niggas dreams when the fifth explosion
Now another mother screams choosing her coffin
Hard reality, it seems like it's simple math, it's not
It's trigonometry (trigganometry) divided by something from real life
And he'll do it again just to get a mill twice
It's not a dream, it's reality, look where it is [ugh]
Nickel and dime free, meanness
World trade occurred on the world stage
On video stations, women spinning
Parading, raping youth
Fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away, fade away ...
And as complicated as it seems, if the things we imagine really happened.
And real life situations were artificial.
They say we're only living to die
Imagine if we are already dead, waiting to live, living in hell
Trying to cross into the sky we are getting confused
Planet earth is like oceans 11, we are planning the getaway
I am the man of this piece! You will never see the light of day ..
Who the hell do you think you're fucking with? I am the police!
I run shit here, you just live here!

I'm a good guy, living my life, friend
Trick on a dumb bitch is nothing I can do
Some try to play fools, shooting at them [?]

That means mass, getting my weights
Gecko or Geico, whatever it represents
Red and blue flags, yours are like a rainbow
Pants hang low

87, one man, eighty weapons
I'm going hard without our protection

I am the best in this profession.
I can't help but bring him back to the mothafuckas essence

A sexy bachelor, hit 'em on your punches
Never break a nigga down your throat
The Phantom, not yet rich enough to be a cop
But picture [?] For pocket niggas
I can exercise you, can you get a [?]
When I lie down, don't dance, give me [?]
Killa is that hot, we know killas on the street
With the heat that makes you feel like a fat boy on the beach
So don't try to run with [?] Talking about all that [?] And shit

So fast come find me
If I had all the bitches in the world, boy, you're still not fucking with me
I am strictly for my money, as long as I stack my banks
I will have enough Young Bucks to fuck with 50
So where I move comes with me
You are fine, play with me, think that I will not take your life
The scope will have more points on you than a website
I'm over my right head and yours left
That's K-Dot, oh, didn't they hear you? Shit, that hot boy

Sum faster than cell phones on speed dial

(Exercise for me, exercise for me)
Feeling like a mother damn animal
Hannibal Lecter from 2012
Chosen to execute every rapper who has stood out
If music is your vocation
You're falling, pick yourself up
If a nigga said he could see me
I bet he told you in Braille, you bastard
Stand in front of the street and then buy you bread
Nigga, you eat meat, I should have worked at Subway
Goliath could not bear my triumph
I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk Zion
See how they face when the heartbeat drops
Me and the curtains dancing like peewee Kirkland calling them Kirk Franklin
Step on them, leave them hurt
They tried to find me guilty for spitting dirty like O.D.B
That's March 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it like a sweet chin
Music at Chuck Norris
Look, look, look
Hm, story of this nigga from the east side
Where across the tracks, opposites attract
Niggas going hard for the color of their flag
Dope man money, welfare recipients
Unfit mothers never heard of obedience
Ho is so devious, all niggas talk
Around the corner, deja vu
Same old shit, kind of like reps
You have to stay strong, if you slip, do you bleed?
Weapons at Levis, 501
Uh, that's the way it is in these streets of L.A.
Look, catch me sitting in my truck
Remy in this cup
There's no tags on this bitch, but I don't give a shit
I ride until the wheels fall off
That's a real shit
Never let it enter your mind, never reveal shit
Let a nigger know your feelings, business and everything
He's the type of nigga riffing and he wants you to fall
Fake niggas tryin 'to impersonate your character
That's why I set my mother's eyes on the scavengers
Look at these!
Pray for the late Charles, why does he have to die?
Thinking of my bursts, then stress starts to kick in
Roll me a plump, fat ass and start drinking
Curse!
I stop selling drugs because blacks started counting
Sex, money and marijuana: the life we began to live
Stay on your job
Keep your eyes open in every corner
In the blink of an eye, and you're a goner
Without grievance, tell them about the pains of this hunger
And the ? going crazy
Just living my life with cool shit
So nigga just misses me with all that bull shit
It was always me against the world
Until I found that it's me against me
Why because why?
Why because why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!
We will put it upside down
And I tell you one more time
What the-
Oh lamar
Pray with the hooligans, shadows in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I am a star
Life is a fun mothafucka
A true comedian, you must love him, you must trust him
Introverted by my thoughts; kids listen up it gets deep
The objective was to process and digest the dialect of poverty.
Inevitable adaptation: gun violence, crack spot
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well respected, calm and serene.
Laughing and joking made life easier; hard times, mom in crack
Her family history: pimpin 'and bangin'
Was meant to be dangerous
I grabbed it and started slandering
I even got something out of a smoker's head last weekend
Dodged a policeman, working for his great friend
Small-time Hustler, graduated in a brick above him
$ 10,000 from a housing project, that's daily
Having seen her first thousand and twenty years, she had a couple of babies
I had a couple of shooters
He picked up a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they robbed '
That was when he turned his back on him and they killed his cousin.
He beat the case and hurried back
Chasing away the birds, Anthony called
The first in projects with the two-tone Mustang.
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circular parking and parking spots
And jumping while you harass the corner blocks
Corrupt cops told Anthony he should kick him
He shook them off and returned to the Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Look, in this chicken place
There was a light-skinned black man who talked a lot
The window worked, it was called Ducky
He came from the streets, the houses of Robert Taylor
Southside Projects, Chiraq, Dome of Terror
He drove to California with a woman and $ 500.
They had a son, waiting for him to see college
Cadillac Sevilla, would ride with his son on weekends
Three-piece special with your name in your shirt pocket
'Cross the street of projects, Anthony planned to steal it
Stuck the place before, in '84
It was then that membership was really eight gears of war
Many relatives tell us, they sell us devilish works
Killing us, crime, smart, criminal
Prevalent proposal with 9's
Ducky was very aware
The manager was robbed and shot at a client last year
Free chicken every time Anthony posts online
They did not kill him; in fact it seems they are the last to survive
Pay attention, that decision changed the life of both
Reverse the manifesto and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put them in random situations
Give them a soul so they can make their own decisions and live with it.
Twenty years later, strangers themselves, you make them meet again
Then you start reminding them about the chicken incident
Who thought the best rapper would be by coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be serving life.

So, I was taking a walk the other day ...
Ali, mix it up
Ha ha ha, bad love, Whaddup?
LOL ...
I freak out until I pass out
There is clarity in my vulgarity for an open mouth
Your parody is not funny
As long as the Lord loves me, I'm good
I could: be the best rapper, but I prefer to be the answer that captures the violence that coincides in my neighborhood
Should: stick a fork in this music business
But I'm too deep like a pussy in my penis
Devil's Kitchen in Phoenix; Is that the heat that I'm bringing to where the shadow is?
I'm a Los Angeles radio and good music, boy, I don't play that
Ugh, walking a fine line of thinking like Einstein
Like a 99-year-old man locked up in prison
Expose yourself as an R&B ho with a hidden sex tape
I'm always for business, you can always feel it
Whether you wear blue or a black who is bleeding
My calligraphy is like Langston and I combined to the hip
Now understand that I am all you have
Give me a chance, give me ears, give me hearts, give me accessories
Oh did you spit Well the retarded slime is back
Look, I'm the author of the authors, the father of the Austin Power belt.
Who can burst like a letter, why bother?
I know that a jealous snake is a burden on my life
But I still carry on as luggage on a flight
I can give you an idea only if you're in sight
And I'm not even trying to give it my all!
You couldn't see my pedestal because you're afraid of heights
Cloud 9 where can you find
Me on my dime like Roosevelt at its best
Wait until I'm at my best
The moon and stars will line up on my Louis V. belt as Orion
It's not just about strikeouts, I don't do that
Kendrick Lamar on the radar for success
I can never stray, unless I am degraded to death
Even then I'll be the best yet, like a little robbery
I am going to: conquer my biggest dreams
Once you open the cage, I bet I'll spread my wings
And all I have is bad credit, big ears and big head
But they'll still feel me, cause we all ate cereal
Hump the daughter of our mother's friend while they hit the stereo
Backflips in shopping carts, free lunch in the park
We saw Power Rangers after school; here we go
I'm so blended that I will never compromise
For no faulty ass A&R or CEO
But we have been here for decades, and I answer for that
Open your mouth for that, speak well as a great iChat debate
Break your other eye
I don't rap, I-Iraq and declare war
I enjoy watching the blood of enemies pouring
I came to the lower middle class, not poor
So don't feel sorry for me, I don't need you to love me
And if you feel furious about jumping then feel free
My feeling is aside, my pride is private
For the maximum prize I will get when I see your suicide
New Kung Fu Kenny
I don't give a shit, I don't give a shit
I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a shit
I'm ready to die for this shit
I cried for this shit, I could take a life for this shit
Put the Bible down and go get this shit
D-O-T my enemy, you won't get a vibe from this shit, ayy
They trampled me in front of my mom
My dad's sheriff got to the commas
Bitch, all my dead grandmothers
Thirty million later, meet the feds watching
Auntie on my Telegram like, "Be careful!"
I'll be hanging out at Tam's, I'll be in Stockton
I'm ready to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fucking life for this shit, nigga
We will not go bankrupt again, the family sells drugs
That's why rap niggas maney-ass better know
If I gotta slap a nigga I'll make him look sexy
If I have to go hard on a bitch, I'm gonna make her look sexy
They won't take me out of my element
Nah, take me out of my element
I'm allergic to a bitch nigga, ayy
Seven figures, that's slimmer than my bitch figure, ayy
Goin 'digital and physical in all of you, ayy
Lots of criminals and money on my phone calls, ayy
They were never ready, yes, I know, yes, I know, yes
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
Years in the making, and don't mistake it
I caught them for a landslide, we talk about races
You know racing takes off, you just have to be patient
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option
If I gotta slap a nigga I'll make him look sexy
If I have to go hard on a bitch, I'm gonna make her look sexy
I stop, I go out, I go out, I make it look sexy
They won't take me out of my element
Nah, take me out of my element
Damn if I do, if I don't (Yuh)
Damn, damn, damn, it's a damn shame
You're not in line, get out of the damn way
Niggas thought they weren't going to see me, huh?
Niggas thought K-Dot's real life
It was the same life you see on TV, huh?
Niggas wants to flex me and be in Los Angeles for free, huh?
The next time you hit Highway 10, we need a receipt, huh?
Because most of you are not real, most of you are going to scream
Most of you just envy, but jealousy kills you
Most of you throw stones and try to hide your hand
Just say his name and I promise you will see Candyman
The last LP I tried to raise black artists
But it's a difference between black artists and Wack artists
If I have to go hard on a bitch, I'm gonna make her look sexy
I stop, I go out, I go out, I make it look sexy
They won't take me out of my element

All my life I ...
Difficult times like "Yah!"
Nazareth, I'm screwed
Nigga, we'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Hey? We'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
I admit that you're looking at me because of the pay cut
But the murder will be looking you in the face
Schemin ', and let me tell you about my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where nice pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mom that I love her, but this is what I like, God knows
Twenty of them in my Chevy, tell them to come find me
Harvesting everything I sow, then my karma comes to heaven
There are no preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a damn gangster silent for the record, huh
Tell the world that I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I went crazy
Drowning in my vices all day
Couldn't you believe when I say
We've been hurt, we've been depressed before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Do you want to kill us dead on the street for you?
Nigga, I'm at the door of the preacher
My knees go weak and my gun could explode
But we will be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Hey? We'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
What do you want from you, a house? You a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Whatever, look, my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
I don't think about it, I deposit every zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it in the Regal
Digging in my pocket, there's no profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic gets another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your boy ... Ah!
If I have it, then you know you have it, baby, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's it
Bick back and Chad, I catch the bag for all of you
My rights, my mistakes; I write until I'm right with God
You wouldn't know
We've been hurt, we've been depressed before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Looking at the world like, "Where are we going?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Do you want to kill us dead on the street for you?
Nigga, I'm at the door of the preacher
My knees go weak and my gun could explode
But we will be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Hey? We'll be fine
Nigga, we'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
I keep my head up
I cross my heart and hope to die
Loving me is complicated
Too afraid of too many changes
I'm fine, and you're a favorite.
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered that you were in conflict
I misuse his influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
The resentment that turned into a deep depression.
I found myself screaming in the hotel room
So I ran for answers
It's over, it's really over
Kobe really retired, it's crazy!
It's just a trip to be doing this right now
Summons marks, Kendrick takes a
What can I say?
I really mean, what can we say?
Day by day, season by season, twenty, to be exact
Grow up watching him paint murals
Using this building as their first study
Using L.A. like your canvas
Restoring crowns back to where they belong
Under royal banners, purple and gold
The color of royalty
My one man L.A. King
Kobe
The whole season has been goodbye
He for us, we for him, for everyone.
It still has magic, but it made it magical
From Compton to Crenshaw
We all witnessed
To all the things that he was
I mean, we share the world with him.
Kobe, within the three-point arc ...
Kobe Bryant has shot the bell!
COURT!
Very soon, it became our identity.
If you weren't born and raised here
Or I never lived here
You would probably never understand
I'm talking about the 81 points
I'm talking about the afro
I'm talking about the alleyoop to Shaq
The game of four extra hours of acquisition in the Finals
Kobe
I'm talking about the posterization of Steve Nash.
I'm talking about Dwight Howard's rookie year when he got baptized
You remember
Kobe wrapped it up
The five parades
Kobe
So I ask, how do empires last when there is no longer an emperor?
I mean we have you
But at the same time, we have you
I'm talking about your blood, your sweat, your tears.
And nothing would replace that or erase that
Forever great in our hearts
So with that said
It is simply due respect
Our due forever
Kobe
I take a sip of Hennessy and then I get drunk
I am not a drinker, I am a thinker, call it what you want
But if you turn your back, you should know that you just missed your chance
To witness the most real shit man has ever been told
I found myself losing focus on a Sunday service
Ashamed, then I start asking God, "What is my purpose?"
He said to live as he did, that's all he wants from me
Spread the word and bear witness, rose on the first Sunday
I said well, excited that my Lord would listen
I opened my Bible in search of being a better Christian
But shit, my life is so fucked up, man; I can't help but give up
I'm giving testimonies to strangers that I never knew
I went up to the pulpit and told them how I was really blessed
I felt free from all my sins when the service ended
Then I lost my faith again
You have to have faith
Life is too much
I just finished
Where's your faith?
All you need is the size of a mustard seed.
Compton single black father raising children of four
They are four innocent bastards because, dad, they don't know
Her day is to work back and forth with the babysitters.
She can't find anyone to take care of her children, so she pays her sister
Your baby daddy ain't shit, that nigga ain't shit
She spilled her daughter's milk just to get a new outfit
She prays to God every night, waiting for him to mature
And maybe one day your children will be something you live for
The baby wants to go back to school, but needs help.
Because it's hard to try to pay the bills when you're alone
He thought about credit card scams, until he heard a voice.
That said, "The devil is a lie, make a better choice."
And so, he goes back to McDonald's and every month tries
With those crazy people from the county building
I looked at the sky and asked him to make a better way
Then she got a letter in the mail, lost her Section 8
Then he lost his faith again
What I am going to do
You have to have faith
Life is too much
I just finished
Where's your faith?
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed.
I dreamed of being 9 miles away from Ray's killa
Ask her why as my eyes fill
Every day it becomes more real, the orangutans hit like gorillas
Rats on the prowl, vultures circling snakes
I flirted with the ideal of stroking steel
To make karma come faster than it normally will
But it never rains in California unless the guns go out
Until then, my feet planted on the ground
Shadowboxing my conscience until my faith begins to respond
And if I don't get an answer, I just know I tried
You should never have looked into your child's eyes
Rayshawn Boyce
What I am going to do
You have to have faith
Life is too much
I just finished
Where's your faith?
(Don't give up, don't give up ...)
Faith
All you need is the size of a mustard seed.
This is for my people to get stressed when times are tough
Her mind slips, wondering, "Is there really a God?"
Knowing that you shouldn't think that way and trying to freeze your brain
But every time there is pain, that feeling remains forever.
We cannot believe what we cannot see and reality seems stronger than prayer.
And your son was born with cancer and lives in urgent care
At the tender age of 12, and you feel like nobody cares
Looking for answers, that's human nature, you're not wrong
I only know when you feel like this His Spirit is in the room
And I wonder why I've never caught that feeling before
Maybe they know him better, or I don't know him better
But what I do know is that it is real and lives forever.
So the next time you feel like your world is about to end
I hope you have studied because it is testing your faith again
I'd rather not live like there's no God
Than to die and discover that there really is
Think about it
Yes
Mhm
Woo woo woo (she has a good head)
Woo woo woo (K-Dot Valentino)
When I lift everything in you
So she can tell her friend that I hit him
So I can get some fame on my tube set
And slang my little, little, little
Wee wee wee
Like a pornstar
Wee wee wee
Now they know who I am
I met this bad little bitch
She had all the Jordan shoes
Hair in a ponytail
I said not to disrespect him
Girl i want a sample
She said "You still don't know me"
I said, "What does that have to do with it?"
A week or nine months I'm still going to hit it
Now admit it, you're tempted, temptation is a motherfucker
Now let your guard down
I just want to fuck you
I'm hard now
She laughed and said, "I am full of curiosity."
I went in, put on the rubber, then I killed that
Hm hm
Her friend on the other side thinks how she is going to get a piece of him.
Preach
When I lift everything in you
Tell your girlfriend i hit him
So she can tell her friend that I hit him
And slang my little, little, little
Wee wee wee
Like a pornstar
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Now they know who I am
Yes, it is Ab-Soul.
I used to fuck on my mom's couch
It was the old days but now a bigger nigger
Like a horny dog, nigga wet dreams and all
Waking up in cold sweat thinking of those hoes, all of you
Without retentions it would go so hard
Sending notes to the bitches in class so much that I barely passed
Waiting for her to give me the mule, yeah throw me that ass
I made her laugh
Maybe walk home
Like Super Bowl Sunday
I call her on the phone
This was before the text
Carson High we were in them girls ”
That's a change if you didn't know
However, let the friend hit
Then he says to his girlfriend, then we let her join
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Wee wee wee
Such a stressed black
I feel like fucking everything now
Look, I've been in bankruptcy too long, I can't find a job to save my life
See, my pride is one thing that I won't let go of
Than? Uh
Have you ever felt that nobody understood you more than you?
Not your mom, your dad, only you are you
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
Have you ever felt that nobody understood you more than you?
No one, no one but you
So it seems like it's just you
So I feel like I want, I want
I want to go, I want to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
I need, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
You can't seem to win by losing
Whatever you are doing turns out to be "what are you doing?"
No one knows what position you are in
But there are a million people who are going through the same thing
That feeling, difficult to explain
When alone, you just want to get away
Something like
Have you ever felt that nobody understood you more than you?
Not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
No one, no one but you
So it seems like it's just you
So I feel like I want, I want
I want to go, I want to go so far from here
I need, I need
I need, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
Away from it all
Take me out of hell where only heaven can visit
The smartest astronomers won't even see my vision
I'm stuck on the couch in the study now, thinking about my daughter
Times get harder, another beat is killed
Just hit record or it looks like I need a mill to keep my shit tidy
From my hat to my shoes, the spirit mixed with pride
Put some shit aside to help me clean my watery eyes
Nothing surrounding me, living my life
Although it is better to write
So how do you feel My nigga, I keep it real
So I feel like I want, I want
I want to go, I want to go so far from here
I need, I need
I need, I need to go so far from here
Very, very far from here
The paradise of poverty
(I've been hungry all my life)
Yes, it's your cousin Carl, man, I'm just calling you, man
I know you've been having a lot on your mind lately
And I know you feel, you know
People have not been praying for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people. Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord will strike you with madness, blindness, and amazement of heart."
Look, family, that's why you feel you feel
As if you had a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you will feel this way
The pain in my heart carries loads full of struggle
Why God, why God do I have to bleed?
Every stone thrown at you resting at my feet
Why God, why God do I have to suffer?
The land no longer exists, aren't you going to burn this muh’fucka?
I don't think I can find a way to do it on this earth
Akcuf’hum siht nrub uoy t'now, erom on si htraE
Teef ym ta 'nitser uoy ta nworht enots yrevE
Deelb attog I od doG yhw, doG yhW
Elggurts fo lluf snedrub yrrac bringh ym ni niaP
Reffus attog I od doG yhw, doG yhW
Teef ym ta 'nitser uoy ta nworht enots yrevE
I hit your butt, I keep talking
I hit your ass if you jump on my couch
I hit your ass if you walk into this house
Go back outside, I hit your ass, little nigga
Better homework is done, I hit your ass
It is better that your teachers do not bother with you in class
Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought them
Better not hear about you hump on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear that he caught you
I hit your ass, you better not run to your father
I hit your ass, you know my patience is wearing thin
I have buku payments to make
The county building is on my butt, try to take my food stamps
I hit you if you tell the social workers that he lives here
I hit your ass if I hit you twice and you're still here
Seven years, do you think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you're going to fear me if you don't fear anyone else
If I could shake the fear away, I'd roll that motherfucker up
And then it would take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life is a bitch, pull the panties aside now
(Pull the panties aside now)
I don't think I can find a way to do it on this earth
I'm going to die anonymously, to die with promises
I'll probably die walking back home from the candy house
I will die neatly because these colors stand out
I'll probably die of witnesses leaving me falsely accused
I'll probably die thinking that your hood and I were cool
Or maybe you die pressing the line, acting too extra
Or maybe I die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll probably die from one of these blue bats and badges
Hitting the body on black and white paint, my bones break
Or maybe die of panic or die of being too lazy
Or die waiting, die because I move too fast
I'll probably die trying to buy weed in the apartments
I will die prolifically because that is what you do when you are 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I could control things
And then it would take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life is a bitch, pull the panties aside now
(Pull the panties aside now)
Now
When I was 27, I got used to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over the years.
How many compliments do I need to block denial?
The impact value of my success shot me
All this money, is God playing a prank on me?
Is it for the moment, and will you see me as Job?
Will you take it from me and leave me worse than before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losing everything
Fear of going back to Section 8 with my stressed mom
30 shows a month and I still won't buy any Lexus
What is an advisor? Someone who is holding my checks
Just to screw me up and borrow my finances?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the bad girl feel when she looked at the numbers?
Punch something, get sick and fill ratchets with a little something
At 27, my biggest fear was being judged
How they look at me reflects on me, my family, my city
What they say about me reveals if my reputation would miss me
What they see of me would leak generations in time
What they hear from me would make them highlight my simplest lines
I'm talking about fear, fear of losing creativity
I'm talking about fear, fear of losing you and me
I'm talking about fear, fear of losing the loyalty of pride
Because my DNA doesn't let me get involved in the light of God
I'm talking about fear, fear that my humility is gone
I'm talking about fear, fear that love is no longer living here
I'm talking about fear, fear that it's evil or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, they are both distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't carry these feelings with me, so I hope they disperse
Looking for resolutions until someone returns
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
Inside fourteen tracks, made on wax
Wondering if I'm living through fear or living through rap
Curse
God curse you, God curse me
God curse us, God curse us
Verse 2 says, "I have only known all the families on Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities."
Until you return to these commandments
We will feel this way, we will be under this curse
So-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible.
The children of israel
He will punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience.
Because we choose to follow other gods
So, just like you punish your own son, he will punish you
Because He loves you, that's why they punish us
That is why we are in the position we are in.
Until we return to these laws, statutes, and commandments.
And do what the Lord says, these curses will be upon us
We will be in a lower state in this life that we live
Here today in the United States of America
I love you family and I pray for you
Shalom
Does no one pray for me?
(There's no one praying for me)
(There's no one praying for me)
Does no one pray for me?
(No one prays for me)
Does no one pray for me?
(There's no one praying for me)
I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losing my focus
I feel like I'm losing my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
I feel like I feel like you're rude
I feel like I don't want to be bothered
I feel like it's not tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is ending, I'm done pretending
I feel like my friends have been overrated
I feel like the family has been pretending
I feel that the feelings are changing
I feel like my thought of commitment is tired
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I did it
I feel like I'm not feeling them all
I feel like taking off, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real to you, right? Shit, I feel like ...
Does no one pray for me?
Does no one pray for me?
Does no one pray for me?
I feel like niggas have been out of your pocket
I feel niggas touching your pockets
I feel like debating who can stop it
I feel that all of you are desperate
I feel like all it takes is a second to feel that
Mike Jordan as long as he has a real microphone
Feel like I'm going to learn a lesson
Although I just feel like myself and the music
Feel the feeling of no hope
The feeling of bad drug
A manipulated quarter ounce of soap
The feeling, the feeling of false freedom
I will force feed them with the poison that fills them in prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
See I feel heartless, often out of this
Feeling of falling, of falling apart with
Filling the gap of being employed with balls
The streets are talking, fill in the blanks with coffins
Blogs and internet pulpit, fill them with gossip
The feeling of an apocalypse happening
But nothing is uncomfortable, the feeling will not prosper
Monsters, false scheming prophets
Church, religion, symbolic blacks in slavery
Demand visits, summons served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for impostors
I can feel it, the phoenix will surely see us
I can feel it, the dream is more than a process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that chases all logic
I want to skate, I want to wait for them
Maybe it's too late for them
I feel like everyone wants me to pray for them
But who the fuck is praying for me?
Does no one pray for me?
Who prays for me?
There is no one praying
Fuck you motherfucker, you're a fucking nigger
I don't know why you're trying to get big, nigga, you're not shit
Walking like you, God's gift to Earth, nigga, you're not shit
You don't even buy me an outfit for the room
I need that wavy twenty-eight inch Brazilian that you play
I shouldn't be fucking with you anyway
You're an off-brand nigga, everyone knows it
Your friends know it, everyone knows it
You won't know, you'll lose to a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the hell is really going on?
This dick is not free
You look at me like it's not a receipt
As if it never made ends meet
Living in captivity increased my salary
Celery, telling me green is all I need
Obviously all I saw was spam and raw sardines
This dick is not free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four-inch wheels
Five percent dye and air conditioning vents?
Damn this dick is not free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not forty ounces and a pit bull
Shit, matador, matador
If the door knocked, let them in, who is that?
Genital's best friend, this cock is not free
He kept me awake looking at pornos in poverty; Sorry? Not
I see you politician with less fortunate people, like me
Every dog has its day, now doggy style will help
This dick is not free
In fact, you need interest
In fact, it's nine inches
In fact, see our business-based friendship
Pension, more pension, you are clicking my percentages
More divorce and party courts
Damn, do you think there's more shit?
Porcelain tube pressure, bust 'em twice
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
I'm going to make my uncle Sam fuck you
You are not a king
Snippet lyrics 1
I hope my daughter is not born with a piece of my heartbreak
AND...
Snippet 2 lyrics
... like Prince Rogers
I feel like release is free, I feel like I should reject Oscars
... games
And I admit that I'm bad talking about shame
But who to blame when the crowd starts cheering and dirty looks pass by?
Now I understand that I will never be understood
Isolation did not work for me
Socializing didn't work for me
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
(Breathing)
What's up, nigga?
I thought you kept it gangsta
I thought this was what you wanted
They say if you're scared go to church
Now baby, when I understand you, I understand you, I understand you, I understand you
I'm going to hit the gas with you
Smoking, watching, rummaging around until I'm idle with you
Because I love you)
Smoking, drinking that potion, you can see me deviating
Because I love you)
(I love you more than you know)
I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in the eye about four or five times
'Until I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (love you)
You said that Sherane has nothing on Lucy
I said, "Are you crazy?"
Roses are red, violets are blue
Now baby, when I understand you, I understand you, I understand you, I understand you
I'm going to hit the gas with you
Smoking, watching, rummaging around until I'm idle with you
Because I love you)
You told me, you said your name was Lucy
I said to him: "Where's Ricardo?"
You said "Oh no it's not the show"
So you spit out some rap like that
You told me, I remember what you said too, you said:
"My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
I don't normally do this, but see you and me Kendrick
Lucy don't worry, Lucy has millions of stories
About these rappers that I looked for when they were boring
Lucy is going to fill your pockets
Lucy is going to get your mom out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion as promised
Lucy just wants your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not that easy, I'm in these roles accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy doesn't loosen for a minute, Lucy works harder
Lucy will call you even when Lucy knows you love your father
Lucy you don't care, because at the end of the day you will chase me
Lucy go get it, Lucy is not shy, Lucy in front
Lucy got paperwork in addition to paperwork
All your life I saw you
And now they all grew up to sign this contract, if that's possible "
I understand you, I understand you, I understand you, I understand you
I'm going to hit the gas with you
Smoking, watching, rummaging around until I'm idle with you
Because I love you)
Registration is out of order.
Because I love you)
Oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
I remembered that you were in conflict
I misuse his influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my resentful power
The resentment that turned into a deep depression.
I found myself screaming in the hotel room
So I ran for answers
Until I got home
I don't normally do this, but see you and me Kendrick
Lucy don't worry, Lucy has millions of stories
About these rappers that I looked for when they were boring
Lucy is going to fill your pockets
Lucy just wants your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
When Lucy knows that you love your father
I'm Lucy, I heard prayers on your first album, really
Lucy go get it, Lucy is not shy, Lucy in front
Lucy got paperwork in addition to paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy caught you
All your life I saw you
And now they all grew up to sign this contract, if that's possible "
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
Jesus takes the wheel [inaudible]
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
I ride shotgun with a shotgun
All my life I have to fight, hittas
All my life I ...
Difficult times like "Yes!"
Bad trips like "Yes!"
Nazareth, I am in one
We'll be fine
We'll be fine
We'll be fine
Hey? We'll be fine
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Uh, and when I wake up
I admit that you're looking at me because of the pay cut
But the murder is looking at you face down
What Mac-11 even explodes on bass?
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty huh, uh is the highlight
Now tell my mom that I love her but this is what I like, God knows
20 of them in my Chevy, tell them to come get me
And heaven has no preliminary hearing, so my record
Boys and girls, I think I went crazy
Drowning in my vices all day
Couldn't you believe when I say?
We've been hurt, we've been depressed before
Hitta, when our pride was low
Looking at the world like, "Where are we going?"
Do you want to kill us dead on the street to 'sho'
Hitta, I'm at the door of the preacher.
But we will be fine
We'll be fine
We'll be fine
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
Hey? We'll be fine
We'll be fine
What do you want, a house, a car?
A piano, a guitar?
I can see evil, I can say it, I know it's illegal
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it in the Regal
Digging in my pocket, there's not a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your boy ... ah!
I don't talk about it, I know about it, every day I do sequels
If I have it, then you know you have it, baby, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's it
Come back and chat, I catch your back for all of you
I rap, I black on the track, so rest assured
I fix my mistakes; I write until I'm right with God
You wouldn't know
We've been hurt, we've been depressed before
Hitta, when our pride was low
Looking at the world like, "Where are we going?"
Hitta, and we hate po-po
Do you want to kill us dead on the street to 'sho'
Hitta, I'm at the door of the preacher.
My knees go weak and my gun could explode
But we will be fine
We'll be fine
We'll be fine
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
We'll be fine
Do you hear me, feel me? We'll be fine
return
See I started from below, from below
I was looking for a background, putting quarters on the black caprice and making it holla (Very good)
Without letting go, I have the piece in me, I have to
Maintain decency and make TNT my product
The bullet from the city center flies to that thing on autopilot (Very good)
I don't really care about worries
All I care about is wearing down your upper body
When I catch you, when I catch you, leaving your parents' house
(Good)
Sound of fourteen years so raw making games at home boy
Big K's and my big dogs
I never, never went straight home boy
(Good)
Pounced
You know we go into the studio and do what we do best
Beautiful shit
But this time I want to do something different boy
Feel me my nig
Get on the keys really fast my nig
(Hook)
Play shit my girlfriend will like
Play shit my girlfriend will like
Yes hahaha yes
This shit that my girlfriend will like
I'm not trying to entertain these other hoes tonight
(Verse 1: Kendrick)
Check me out
She tells me that Kendrick left it at that
When I listen I want to close my eyes
And feel your lips
Let your letters wrap around me and grab my hips
So tempting
O'clock like a viking's helmet
Kicking up dust like I'm walking
I'm not going to call a bitch woman for this
I will call my wife so I can get
She just got off work and God knows it was difficult
She takes off her shirt and God knows I'm tough
Making up, trying to stay happy
Now she could talk about her boss and I can give her advice.
Or she could take off her panties and I could eat my (FOOT FOOT)
Fuck that, option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this song
You know why?
I'm not trying to entertain these other hoes tonight
Ha, ha, yes
This shit that my girlfriend will like
I'm not trying to entertain these other hoes tonight
Aba, this shit my girlfriend will like my nigga
Look
(Verse 2: Kendrick)
We're in the car, bumping into my last jam
I recorded in the studio around 10 p.m.
It's a club banger
Catchy hooks and 808
The first 8 bars, she loves the track
Even rewinding
As soon as the beat drops
The way he reacts likes "That's hot"
Until I start talking about how many hoes I have
How many have I tricked just to get a nut?
Like a squirrel, looking for lunch.
Uh
Although I'm in a cliché rapper shit
I know she thinks my lyrics are so accurate
She's so cool range
Don't minimize it just to screw up the mood
She will still play it even if it seems rude
And I despise provocative records
One thing that if
This is something that my girlfriend will like
Other hoes tonight
soul
This is something that my girlfriend will also like
This is a great idea
This will be my girlfriend's joint here
So I'm going to kick the shit you like
Seems correct
Like a pair of skinny jeans
Around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
At the cinema
Your body language is read
Like a ruby
Because she is a work of art
Without Julie's help
I am a beast and she is a beauty
I love her, she knows, I don't put anyone above her
Far from being a bow, but better undercover
Like an iPod connected to a USB
It's just you and me
I mean her and me
I mean she and I
It is easy to see, affirmative
So if you ever need me
You know where Herbert is
In his mind
Like her in mine
Uh
Play shit that my girlfriend will like
Because I'm not trying to entertain you other hoes tonight
She also makes music, this shit that my girlfriend will write
If she were me talking about her
DJ
Play shit my girlfriend will like
I'm not trying to entertain you other hoes tonight
Now i'm anxious to get some stuffed animal
And this is for friends
I'm talking about the exchange you find, Rollie
Someone get ready to pass me the blow of that endo, I'm trying to fly
I'm trying to appear like the fifteen in my Cadillac Brougham
Looking for E.T. call to home
Tadow, the flavor I kick reminds you of good morning
Thinking back when we used to run at the exchange meeting for the Rollie chains
Pro Club shirts, whiter than Anglo-Saxons
That is fashion if you come from where I am
Compton California, a love of murder capital under the sun
Young niggas running down the street in a heat bigger than me
But I don't stumble, I still dip like sauce on a chip
Rolling Rosecrans to pick up my man, A-Mack
He's talking about some nonsense about how we can pick up some hoes, he thinks that
And then I took him around 3:30, telling me everything is fine
Tiger Woods, now we're looking for the little birds
Stopped in sto 'to get some gums
Got up in the breezes, well what do you know? I think they love us
And this is for friends
I'm talking about the exchange you find, Rollie
Niggas with chains and white t-shirt
Baby tell the truth yeah you know we got it going
And if you feel good (hey)
Raise your hands up and lift the hood (hey)
Represent the city as you know you should (hey)
I want to make sure you understand that we have it going
(Is it correct? Is it correct?) We have it running
(Is it correct? Is it correct?) We have it running
(Is it correct? Is it correct?) We have it running
As I continue my day, pretty copacetic
I went to my mom's house to see what the greens were talking, hungry as hell
I had the right food, I rescue myself, I need some gas
We used to stand in line for Jordans, excited to have them
Throwback jerseys, Chamberlain and James Worthy were two of my favorites
But I'm still still, smoking in that Hiroshima
The ashtray has a million roaches, I'm focused but I feel good
Friends hanging on {?} And Monte Carlos
Impalas and Tahoes, shoot something black, break those fifty
I'm gripping the city like I'm supposed to
Making my presence felt like Christmas Day, what can I say?
Each voice is spoken with the wisdom of a G
If you can't relate, take a seat
So wherever you are, won't you let him know?
And stand for the land you grew up from
I got like new Chuck Taylors
While giving you cuts like fresh tapers
I'm so dumb with that, I go crazy
You're shitting like Tuck, the bounce breaks loose
Take them to school, I must do it, this is great
Made me breathe with dragons
I break your bastard egg
Why do you go to the teacher?
Like you're sick with this
I really do this shit
You are not equivalent to Kdot the Almighty
Look at this, I'm going to body
Anyone in the crowd
You love me John Gotti, you couldn't see me
Spying on this is freestyle outside the dome
I'll let you know why every other rapper needs to go home
This is a new verse, I put rappers in a new hearse
I take rappers to the new church
Who wants to see me, you first
Then the second, then the third
Nouns, my verbs
Fight these words
Nigga that shit is absurd
Troi Breeze:
OK if I'm second or I'm third
Whatever he just said you heard
But I'm coming and I think I have a new verse
I'm really trying to change the way that I've been living at home
I'm really doing it
Nigga, I'll be doing this
Nigga, I'm going through this
Nigga I will and I swear I'm very studious
Nigga, I'm a student and I watched how you did it
Now I'm about to do it from the tip of the fucking tip
If you're about to get off the top, then you fucking did it
If you say you're the best, then nigga, won't you admit it?
I see you have the waves in your hair, I've been there
Back in eighth grade, when the pussy was scared
But now I'm seeing all kinds of women in peripherals
This is individual, this is a ritual.
This here is spiritual.
This is not rap, this is the body of God
Nigga, this ain't close to lyrical
Shit, all I'm saying now is that I agree with you
Now i'm trying to make it like a seed and grow
And now I'm blessed like I just sneezed; hachew
I really appreciate it
I really appreciate that you called me because I'm here and I'm doing well
Taking the bigger shots, and now I've been trying to waste the bigger knots
Cause I'm really out here trying to grind for my family
My brother was from Piru.
My comment was from what raised him on Grape Street
Kendrick:
Well, if your brother was from Piru and your part was from Watts
So you should already know about them Compton blocks
All my niggas that are with me are from the city
All my niggas hold choppas and they're with me
And this is TDE, this is strictly strict for my niggas and bitches, tell me you're with me
(roar of the crowd)
You see that scream right there, that's the scream that any other rapper scared
That's that scream that any other clapper scares
If they did, they'd get a fucking slap like my nigga Snoop Dogg in '94
This is the Kurupt flow
This is the LBC shit
This is Compton DPGTDE shit
Fuck me shit
Troi Breeze:
My name is troi breeze
Kendrick:
Come on
And hopefully I found her
My nigga tell me about this girl that he knows, oh
Said she's the kind of girl I'm looking for, oh
I got right to the point when he picked up the phone
When he picked up the phone he said hello and I said
A friend of mine said you were the one for me
A friend of mine said you were with everything
A friend of mine said that you are good company
I have a good baby pussy
I want it baby
I have to have it baby
Now girl I don't wanna come out so strong
But I heard that you have the love that I want
Can you promise me what they say is true?
Before you tell me your name? Are you with that
A friend of mine said you were the one for me
A friend of mine said you were with everything
A friend of mine said you have a good baby pussy
I have a good baby pussy
Can i try baby Because I'm curious, curious
I want it baby
I said I need it baby because I'm very curious, curious
{Bridge}
Tell me are you on that?
Are you with that (4 times)
Tell me are you on that?
Are you with that (4 times more)
Give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that kind of thing
That girl, that idiot, that pussy
Whatever you want to call it, I can't get enough
Be your number one or your ten
Cry baby dress, and just like UPS or FedEx girl, we can both send
Then pray in the morning, then, after praying, more games in the morning
I promise that if we do, I will remain serene
I really understand
No one has to know how a group of men do
So mom don't trip
So what's going to be miss, my watch is ticking?
Are you going to tell me now?
Or you need more time if you do it is ok
While I go down, the girl decides
Faster than a pornstar, jump on my cock.
And get fucked for milliseconds
Duck when I take the gun out of my mouth (Buh!)
Shooting at you like a sawed off
Aiming at your grill like it's Paul Wall
Then ring until not all of you
My cerebral cortex is like a war vet.
Bananas straight, I never gave a shit
'About anything but my mom, my dad, my brothers and my grandmother
And if neither one, then I have to answer
Every question with a bullet hole in my hammer
Just like VH1, that's beyond your understanding
Like a deaf person who comes to court for a hearing
Who do they fear? K. Dot
Tickling Women's Nipples
Make your bitch grab her crotch when she hears my shit, bitch!
K. Dot got the unorthodox flow
Murder for rent, acquire choirs for funerals
Compton on my back like my masseuse's tits
Too bad, you're kidding who here?
Go against me, I rebuke you
And I wake you up at six in the morning
Jump shot, forensics catch them on the rebound
Pans, pots, plates, bowls
I'm in your kitchen eating your stove
I'm hungry and hibernated
I'm cold like Miles Davis
It just gets more egregious, nigga, I don't have a brain
Like a blind bitch that doesn't suck dick
Dinosaur dung, big shit
Smell or die fast, dammit!
(jab, jab, jab, left right)
I can stand in a puddle of gasoline lighting a joint and never set myself on fire
(How come what?) Silly motherfucker, I'm fire
Hit the devil on the cheek, gave him a third degree burn
I used to freeze him when he was asleep and he said you would be fine
Many rappers are desperate to be a star every day
I'm just saying, I feel like I'm the one
Like a magician with a stick in his hand, or the name of a Mexican
I become ignorant with you
Take a picture of me, bitch, I'm famous
I came to this crazy world in my palm and drinking Paul Masson
He locked him in a cellar and amputated his shooting arm.
Like a fifty mile strip when I'm pimping these hoes
(ee)
(K.Dot got the unorthodox flow
On fire make a rapper burn his soul
Murder for rent, purchase choirs for funerals)
(Look, ee)
I remember being young, silly, looking for the next emotion
Angry teens, three things on our minds
Money, murder and you
I love bad bitches, that's my damn problem
I love bad bitches, that's my damn problem
And yes, I like to fuck, I have a damn problem
(If finding someone real is your damn problem)
Bring your daughters to the crib, maybe we can figure it out
Perfect picture, uh huh
And I paint a perfect image, my intention is to enrich myself
But I'm not trying to split the winnings with you
Every pocket in me bleeds, I'm a selfish nigga
Mmm, deuces up, black coupes are us (Uh, huh)
Head to the bathroom
I pray for that, I'll be back soon
Damn problem, fuck your problems
I have five phones for five different reasons.
London, Tasha, Mya, Keisha
Courtney, blue-eyed demons without visas
Abroad, high heels, wine and pizza.
Bad bitches overdose, I swear
One in both arms but I need two pairs, beast
I love bad bitches, that's my damn problem
And yes, I like to fuck, I have a damn problem
(If finding someone real is your damn problem)
Bring your daughters to the crib, maybe we can figure it out
Yes hi this is the end
My animated talk turns into a rally
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then go back to Cali, mmm
The irony, I fuck them at the same time
She looks at me like a nigga doesn't exist
Girl I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar.
A.K.A. Benz-is-to-Me-Just-a-Car
That means your friends need to be on par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill them all, corpses in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen to what the crystal ball says
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll make you, beast
I love bad bitches, that's my damn problem
And yes, I like to fuck, I have a damn problem
I love bad bitches, that's my damn problem
And yes, I like to fuck, I have a damn problem
I love bad bitches, that's my damn problem
And yes, I like to fuck, I have a damn problem
(If finding someone real is your damn problem)
Bring your daughters to the crib, maybe we can figure it out
Gather around. I'm glad everyone's out tonight. As we stand on the corner of our neighborhood, know that this burning fire represents your passion. Listen, Keisha, Tammy, go ahead. I recognize all of you. Each creed and color. That said ... fuck your ethnicity. Do you understand what? We are going to talk about many things that worry you. All of you...
Now everyone, raise your hands up
If you don't give a shit, put your hands up
Now I don't give a shit if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, damn
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
Fire burning within my eyes, this is the music that saved my life
They'll call it hip-hop, I'll call it hypnotize
Fuck that, nigga look at that line, it's so diverse
Everyone can't drive Benz, and I've been there, so I make it my business.
To give you my full attention, ten shacks! Man I have to lift my wind
Man, I have to sleep with God because I have my sins up
In fact, don't mistake me for a rapper
They sit behind the scenes and hide behind the fucking cameras.
Mosh pit, I had a microphone and I threw it away
I had a brain, then I lost it, I'm crazy
So you don't care how much it costs, penny for my thoughts
Yes man, I'm the postman, can't you say, man?
Go postal, never freeze, when I get close to you
HiiiPower
Reporting live from Planet Terminator X
I saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47
Now I don't give a shit if you
That doesn't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
I'm tired of all of you, because you all lied to you
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
I knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I was kicking that math, dropping that science
Like an alchemist, and I'll kick that ass, lyrically I'm UFC
If a UFO had come for me, it would come back with the head of an alien.
Don't alienate my dreams, do it well
Get a life, I have two, that's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man, I'm fly, put wings on my back
What an airplane or an angel? Both like a pilot with a halo, whoa ... disgusting
I mean, I've seen so many things go through them, he, she, you
And the power in people and if they don't believe us
They will die
Wizard
Now I don't give a shit if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, damn
That doesn't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga
I overheard a conversation with my father talking to his favorite partner
At the domino table Tony had told him he saw a
A young black man jumping like four cards
Taking pills, mix a gallon of sperm and a little holy water
Mix a gallon of sperm and a little holy water
Sell it to a priest who can probably take it off tomorrow
It's bad when my favorite uncle kicks him
Ghosts are not the only suicide
Open the door to your soul
Go out to the hall and then to the closet, you see a rifle
Aim for your arteries, forgive me, part of me is psycho
In hindsight, my respect was a high note from Power Ranger
Lie back on a high karate note
Amazing Ninja Turtles, pizza and Sega Genesis
Something my dad said that caught my eye
He said I'm seven and sixty-seven
The day I turned seventeen is the day that a lesson in my life
Come through a clothing line, each stick is a co-sign
Everything on the streets has the power to make me blind
Even if he sat me in the sun and gave me those eyes
She understands well and I could smell the sobriety that evaporates on its own
He said, "Tony, my biggest fear is hearing that Kendrick went missing in the fire and I didn't help.
So if i can give you the game to hydroplan your decisions in life so you can go
Sacrifice my life, even if that shit, my mom, though
Until the day he was carried by the Big Six, he dominated
Don't take off your cap because of the black threat
K Dot Thoroughbred
Move like a militant soldier
At a point like a pyramid, force to be reckoned with
With the best shit
Like the strongest manure, I'm ready when you are
That's it
I'm in the lab cooking all day, I get up all day
Like a nymphomaniac, I've been high from the waves
Trying to convince the hoes, I have good hair
Knowing very well that there are chemicals there
I'm in the neighborhood with the 17 year olds who are on the neighborhood patrol
At any moment you can lose your life, so kiss your children or hug your wife or whatever
I spawned with a dragon
He came out of the battle laughing
I hit them until their nose runs
You know the hoes will come if I'm there
And the hoes run once we get to that hotel
That's not a guess, calm down before I move
Get on 105 and do about 105 before your ass is thrown
The back seat
There's a dead man on the highway, oh it's not Dot
Tell the doctors it's alright, a beast when the beat breaks
But to me it's just a shot away
All right, I throw a spear at Nas, a prick at Jay
Made of matter, no, I take it back
Look, I don't play real rap legends like you
And I'm crucial, hidden by real Crips and Soowoos
And they shoot, they photograph the students when the meat reaches Compton's making!
When I jumped off the porch
They forced me to resort to the last resources of a short temperament
I was hoarse from screaming
The demons that fought within me taught society how to rejoice
A good boy in a crazy city, a little upset
Pellets falling directly to my melon, apparent reason
It was probably because my cousin was making blood
That was bloody in public
And Kendrick saw him with him last weekend, cuz
But you're not a relative to me, instead of Kendrick, I'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, surely that is your remedy
Well I have enemies but I don't hit
But those are the repercussions like
When your cousin is groping for blood
So you're all alone in the Compton show, he said:
Yeah look buddy I gang bang (bomb, bomb)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I do my things (bomb)
Where are you from, where are you staying or where is your grandmother staying
Where are you from, where are you staying or where is your grandmother staying
Like on the ground you know the sound
Sympathetic because they like to see you
Tryna fights back a herd of piranhas
I promised three of them to hit the black on my back
And the pajamas were almost necessary
I should have gone to sleep and seen some sheep.
When I greeted the pavement
He got up and saw the surprise on their faces.
My luck in the palm of a cherry bomb.
And they wait to exploit me
Then I heard someone's gun
Make a sound like it's moving in my direction
Expected to drop in a second, look at the flaws
I have done it in the shortest time possible
And in the back of my mind I'm like "this is the loss I'm going to take"
My destiny was distressed
I'm probably pushing daisies
Before I can get to the car
Cross cancel and just before you see
The black glove raising the handle said:
Yeah look buddy I gang bang (bomb, bomb)
A gang member, I'm active, I do my thing (Pump)
I'm really from the sect, though (Bomb, bomb)
And whether or not it is, I still need to know
Where are you from, where are you staying or where is your grandmother staying
Where are you from, where are you staying or where is your grandmother staying
Where are you from, where are you staying or where is your grandmother staying
Bitch, I'm back, can I borrow my uncle's leash in a minute
Jump in a Civic and then use that bitch on my lap
I was shy but now I'm tempted
And tenants alert me to where you are
I'm a threat when I'm offended, relentless, I'll react
Then someone said the office
That's a fact when you're black and underdeveloped
You are profiled as a criminal
I'm dancing in Boulevards with my basketball and a backpack
Gym shoes and my nap bag
Hair diaper, my cap turned inside out
And then I look back, strobe lights on my tailpipe
Turn left then right
He became deaf because the sirens sounded
Pray to God they won't shoot me
Pray to God that the sunlight will continue to shine for an additional 30 minutes.
I hope there is a warning light when I am about to turn off the engine
Although being a criminal is not my memo
But this is what he said when I lowered the window:
And whether or not it is, I still need to know
Where are you from, where are you staying or where is your grandmother staying
Can I pay a visit to my past?
Compton Centennial School District
And the video campus closes the mouth of your facilities
King Drew and Westchester had the baddest bitches
And my nigga L Wood had a white Toyota, and we got pulled over
And everyone knew that
My nigga Yan Yan had all the red hat P
Which was really silly because where we were
It was the other side and more than likely
The other side really didn't like that
It had no burner, so if we were shot we could never really shoot
That the black car didn't stop and asked where all you blacks come from
I know some less fortunate niggas were fucking the enemy bitch
He had a fat ass and a brown Camaro, but it wasn't that fast, it was like a V6
But still she was one of those high school hoes with braids
Well she's important, well she wasn't, she was so, so, so, so cousin
He was red, so every time she got in, who was he going to get
Now let me get back to the plan
Homie had asked, "Do you have a man?"
Where you stay? "She said," Rosecrans "
He said, "What? You're a, you're a weird bitch huh?"
I can work that pussy and tongue
If you come, I can make you cum
Because I like to get drunk. "
Notice that he was off limits
Oldies playing in the background
Let's do it, Marvin Gaye was out in the morning
Time to go, he picked up his pants from the floor
When he came out he saw a four four Bluh!
I didn't know that was the pussy I was dealing with
And that's how you kill your bitch!
This is how you kill your bitch!
This is how you kill your bitch!
Fucking them hoes, hoes, hoes, hoes
Hoes hoes will have you dead dead dead dead
Look. I think we can all learn from mistakes
But your first mistake could be your date of death
And death waits for no one
A million ways to die, and you can make it a million and one
If you don't know the rules or maybe you're trying to fill someone else's shoes
Like a square trying to be a gangster who remembers this guy
I wasn't thirteen, I was twenty-two
When he went to put on the hood
But usually, this type of person wants to demonstrate their self-esteem on purpose
Tell everyone to stop working, but it really isn't worth anything
His mom had money, his dad had money, so he had money
The OGs who gave him a gun, think he would be just another shock doll
And the funny thing about it, he thought he was fighting like P-Miller
But he was no killa
Just a monkey hanging around a group of gorillas
Everyone wants to be a tough guy, so he did, he approached this guy like, "Where are you from?" with his gun but didn't shoot it, rule number one
Even though the guy didn't hit himself the next day, he saw his brain blown out while the boy in the house was cruising
Not knowing that the scariest nigger will divide your shit
And that's how he killed his bitch!
That's how he killed his bitch!
Fuck you and kill your bitch! How?
Without knowing the G codes, the codes the codes
G codes, codes, codes
G codes, if you don't know then you're already dead, dead, dead
Feel me?
DJ EFX
Lil Wayne aka Lil Weezy!
Weezy Baby!
Fo sheezy?
Have you been in this game for how long now?
Now I'm going to be 12 years old
12th year, and how old are you?
I have 21
twenty-one
SB dunks, five seven five jeans
$ 5,000 in my damn wallet chain
I'm going to be a man, I'm a man from the island
There's nothing else for me, man (Ha ha)
I tell them to float and continue with the ozone, I'm not
My hard hitting like a long long long stick
I got that dick back, I don't need that thumb bone
That's the one that goes Di-di-di-di-di-di-dit
I'm so cool when I spit I put my foot up my ass
Now i'm kicking your shit now i'm throwing your bitch
And she catches it with her lip, no, she catches it with her mouth
And since I'm the president, she tried to catch him in her blouse
I say, whoa, easy, honey
I'm pastel king, so eat the baby
Wait, the shit gets crazier
We turn the bitch like she's at the gym
I'm not fucking with the bitches with the stadium
That's not a dome, bitch, go home
Bitch spit the hundred winters in my snow cone
Lil 'nigga walking like she's got her bowl on
Then it comes back as a rental
I bet bitches understand me for information
Get your top chopped and trim under
Something like my Benzo, Ridin 'with my friend's hoes
No, I mean my son's friends, all my friend's friends
Taking all my ends that will spin that balloon
I tell these young blacks, cool or die
I won't get that Benz if they don't divide them. The eyes plunge them into the thighs, narrow them.
And if you reach I
I don't preach, I scream and I give you beef with french fries Yes
I live where all the seagulls fly
Look baby I'm so stoned
Me and Mac are just two niggas on the same hood
Fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool
I'm just the young lion and he's the young bull
No Sammy the Bull, that gun on my hip, now I have to get in the pool
I think it was red devil
I am t-i-red, I am T.I red
You D.I-ed for what you said
Chyee, I'm sharp as a picture
And I keep hitting it like a damn stain
Two twins drink me like Guinness
When I'm done, I say "Billion"
When I'm done they say, "Weezy, you killed him"
Get on your shit and say "Weezy, you healed him"
So fly, I tattooed wings
A gun hit me, but I hit you in the stomach
And I smell grass
Young Money mothafucka, where's that cheese?
It's the real shit, yeah
Yes sir you know
You see me? I eat, sleep, shit and speak snapshots; so fuck rap
Bitch niggas where ya cars?
They like it, "Wayne, why the hell did you wear black?"
I'm about to bring CMR back
And all the lame we lost that
And all we have is Weezy, Weezy and Lil 'Weezy to go back
"It's a Weezy baby!" The ballers back
Stop playing, I've been playing
You don't want me to spray my Glock: I hit all those cats
You don't want my stomach to hurt, I shit on those cats
Give me all those gats. Cool and B, everything is rap!
If I'm the only hot boy, what do you call him?
You don't want to fuck with Weezy
You don't want to fuck with Weezy
Bitch what? I will destroy your ass
Don't even go around
Niggas get your money
We probably need to crash
And the shit got me in the ass
They find niggas in the shit with their ass up
And I heard they have a good chain
And for the right price, I'll blow the right brain
Your nigga might fly, but I still get insignificant
Traveling around the city just me and my friend
Friday night special, professional aim
A gangsta is who you listen to
I am more real than, I have more ability than
I have more skill than them there
I'm a cash millionaire
You don't want to fuck with Weezy
You don't want to fuck with Weezy
Hot Boy, Hot, Hot, Hot Boy, Hot, Hot, Hot Boy
Hot, hot, hot boy
Baby let me bring the rover keys
No, let me get the house keys at Eastover
So I can throw a 500 degree platinum party, then the after party
Me and my squad stomping on this bitch, we fucked a Kappa party
Don't go to rapper parties, I'm not a rapper
But when the friends come home, we throw a monster jam
We went to the promised land
I bought big, I'm a Tymer man
Son of a Stunna, still a girl fucking a scammer!
Weezy, keep it at bay for your baby Bubba
You're fucking with a big dog, nigga fucking wow
Mr. S-Fucking-Q - I'm the fucking truth
Three stripes, maybe Nikes, a lot of ice fucking ooohf!
That's 500 degrees!
You don't want to fuck with Weezy
You don't want to fuck with Weezy
Hot Boy, Hot, Hot, Hot Boy, Hot, Hot, Hot Boy
Hot, hot, hot boy
I know dad left
Don't worry because your child is still the one
Dwayne Micheal Jr, born that
But I changed my name to Wayne
And black, I will not return
I'm a little small but I thought it would be bigger if I sold crack
OG from the block said "Youngin expect that"
I hit the street and then I fell
It became good to cook until it smells flat
Junior high was prison
High school was the bail
Have a baby in new Pampers on campus
This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with it (hit me in the face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Yeah fresh just hit me with that
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Play with me in my head, play with me in my head)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with it (hit me in the face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Because I kill them with the current, I kill them with the current)
And Rabbit taught me how to get more out of it
And still get money like he's on the payroll
And if someone slows down payroll
I have to turn his tight cap into a halo
So adapt to crack loads
The yayo, the blow
And turn that ho into tomatoes or plants
And yes, I smoke back to back
Like I'm on two tracks but you don't feel that
I have my dogs with me looking for silly cats
Weezy where the city at
And if I fall, stay awake
Because i can get it back
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But you can bless me with it (Bless me on my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Yeah fresh just hit me with that
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
(Play with me in my head, play with me in my head)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with it (hit me in the face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But you can bless me with it (Bless me on my chest)
(Because I kill them with the current, I kill them with the current)
People always tell me I'm heavy, I say I believe
But I don't get the comments entirely
Kicking the door, hands up, or black knees
If I don't take everything, I'll come back
And I stick to my word like beeswax
He acts like a jerk for these piles
Few leaves left the only tree standing
I'm too deep, my roots are deeper than the place
Where their bodies shouldn't sleep
But be it
Never let a nigga with a knife see my back
I'm out of here
Let me see my hat
And I swing it so low I can't see where I am
This that boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Fresh just hit me with it (hit me in the face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But you can bless me with it (Bless me on my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Yeah fresh just hit me with that
(Play with me in my head, play with me in my head)
Fresh just hit me with it (hit me in the face)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
But you can bless me with it (Bless me on my chest)
That boom, boom bap, bap, boom boom bap
Take that shit off your front
Gudda! Sir
Uh oh
No one is challenging like me
I know what I'm worth, so when you pay me
I just know that I'm not cheap (I'm not cheap)
On the way to wealth
Tearing this shit to pieces
No i won't look for the beat
It started on the block
I stood up and climbed to the top
I'm the cleaning man with the mop
50 shots defaced its top, yeah (defaced)
I walk through the city like God (God)
Someone, please tell me, what are the odds?
In this microphone I am a magician, but this is not Oz
Cold but hot, I can turn summer into autumn
I'm sicker than all of you
I'm buying some acres, there's no time for a neighbor
I'm from New Orleans yeah I'm a crocodile
I will do you a favor, and I will not do you a favor
Because if i do you a favor
I have to put my hands on you
Like I'm giving you prayer
East side, we are not playing fair
Have you ever heard of the turtle and the hare?
I'm changing the gear
Nigga, I'm here.
Gudda!
(Blows smoke)
I have my hoes married to individual drugs
I have my fattest hoes finger fucking
And my trash hoes are clean as shit
Take off your shoes before entering
Take off your shoes before crossing the line
I slept in father's time
I have my thugs to kidnap Daughter Time
I have a gun that fired for seven minutes
I'm done shitting, niggas never spit it out
I'm high class, primary niggas
I'm a hot boy under air conditioning
Shoot the gun with your left arm limping
George Jefferson in the seven minutes
I got a hot girl off TV
With a very sticky furry kitten
In the correct position, shouting "You are consistent"
I sit there and listen like we're talking about business
I don't need her here filming niggas
I really would prefer that he steal from blacks
Kush loud as Fred yelling "Wilma!", Black
I've been taking time to count the bands
Break a promise in the promised land
From the intermediary to the Macho Man
I've been talking shit at Diddy's house
I went to Disneyland, I talked to Mickey Mouse
So I found out how to solve
What I was finding out, you find out
I have a trigger man with an extra hand
The sky is the limit, head in the clouds
While you run, I will run
You get it, I'm not dumb enough
I got to the courtroom and it sucked
High going down, plug going up
You are going to hold me, you are going to hold me
You don't know me, but you know what happens
And the coca was cut with some extra coca
She doesn't know what love is, it's not important love
As long as we can continue to extort the plug
Just let it be and ignore the buzz
Pour it out, catch a sugar rush
Chopper full of rust, but still breaks
Like a hundred holes, I have a hole in one
Sure full as shit, money full of dust
And I'm dwelling on that "What the fuck?"
If you look long enough, you're a mussel, punk
That's a Bugatti on steroids
Bugatti at Chevron
All white as a high
From Teflon to Kevlar
I don't mean shit when you take your head off
Make the top dog jump dead
Then we hold your head for a memory
I accelerated without the head
Goin 'Big Bruno on Mars
Sippin 'Lone Star, become a pornstar
To a known star with a phone call
Purple, purple rivers, yeah
I've been exploiting 10s, yeah
'Cause my bitch blew up every 20's, damn
I met Satan, he was relaxing, wait
Cloudy, cloudy water
Floating purple ribbons
I'm cursed but I'm still religious
Take off your clothes bitch
Call your road dog, bitch
I feel like O-Dog, bitch
Boyz 2 Threat
The lyrics of this song have not yet been released. Check back once the song has been released.
Yeah uh-huh
Come on yes
Mmmhmm, bells
Yeah hmhmhmm
Let's go
Hanging around the city
With some new heat
New car
New seats
New scent
Put out the cockroach
Light a new L
Fuck you bitch
I'm acting brand new
My new shirt
Fuck you bitch
My new shoes
Fuck you bitch
I'm acting brand new
Yes
I'm cold like midnight
I am the president
And the murderer
Cameras in
Welcome to the show
I am the main attraction
Money in the attic
Money on my mind
Money is my habit
Stay in the routine
Until the money is automatic
Bitch I love money
I'm a fucking fanatic
Always tied, tight, holding
What what? Who I (Click-clack) Explosion
Chrome 24's, napkin-thin tires
I have to ride big because I'm like a captain
Probably in my office, doing my taxes
And I don't even have time to practice
Hanging around the city
With some new heat
New car
New feet
New seats
New scent
Put out the cockroach
Fuck you bitch
Fuck you bitch
My new (new) shirt
Fuck you bitch
My new shoes (they too)
Fuck you bitch
I'm acting brand new (yeah)
Ice
Ridiculous price
Hm, I'm fishing, and the bitches will bite
Right
And if she doesn't wear panties then I fuck her on sight
I'm disgusting like spice
I know what you like
I can make a black woman
Scream like her white
I can make a white woman
Scream like Mike
But before she starts singing
She has to check my microphone
Niggas just hate
And I've lost my sight
It's like I don't see them
I only see the light
Talking about that shit
But you guys just hype
Louis V tennis shoes
Large brown stripe
Shit, nigga, I'm ripe
Hanging around the city
With some new heat
New car
New seats
Light a new L
Fuck you bitch
I'm acting brand new (new)
My new (new) shirt
Fuck you bitch
My new shoes (they too)
Fuck you bitch
OK
New Coupe
Going crazy that a mother
With the burner sitting underneath
I have my tank top down
It's probably not summer
Damn, there's no way to keep up with brother
Could you spell my name on burnt rubber
I left! Leave me alone
Now the dog is dining
You could wash my plate and put it back in the closet
Ahem, I'm way ahead of them fools
I have to start rapping in numbers
They come fast like thunder
Hanging around the city
With some new heat
New seats
New scent
Light a new L
Fuck you bitch
I'm acting brand new (new)
Fuck you bitch
My new (new) shirt
Fuck you bitch
My new shoes (they too)
Fuck you bitch
I'm acting brand new (yeah)
We had those bitches addicted like it was a drug
Weezy, fresh and unplugged
Give me a big, thin bitch in a dress, one that puts her lips on the effect
Suck your dick to the shit on your chest
You can pee on his chest, I like that shit
Project hoes like that dick, don't bite that dick
I really don't care how (?) Shorty
Give me head, I don't care, swallow semen, don't spit
White girls record them and enjoy them
They love it when everyone saw it, it's off the chain
Tall yellow mexican bitches, all for brains
But look at the hoes that want change, it's not a game
Or a short Cuban, although with a fat ass
I bet I'll treat the bitch like Fidel Castro
If you go on and break me at the end of the night
You can ride with me
Because I like Simmon's jeans, I'm not trying to make a love scene
I really just want you to break me
Listen, listen, it's Weezy the hottest, drinking at Barcadis
I run through the scene in a Lincoln on Robbers
Later I'm trying to climb behind your spine
Wait lil mom, put your ass down
Pick you up, get into you, throw your ass
Now throw your butt and shout my name
I can't hear you say it louder what (Wayne, Wayne)
A damn shame, better look at that boy who is nasty
I tie the plastic, I bounce you like elastic
I like a short, thick, fat ass and shit
In fact, when I see her, + Pull + her + Over + like a cop
Juvey coulda "backed it up" and I'm going to "drop it like it's hot"
Did you hear me already ?! (What? Haha)
Haha, unplugged
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me at the end of the night
You can ride with me
Because I like Simmon's jeans, I'm not trying to make a love scene
I really just want you to break me
I like them big and round, pretty and brown
A bitch who takes it from behind and makes the sound (Ugh Ugh)
Now you can bounce the slide drop, dizzying, dizzying
Now you can ride until you feel it go crazy
Shake for the hood, bounce for you baby daddy
Twerk for that nigger got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the KY, wait, pause
My bitch has thongs, your bitch has drawers
My girl likes to swallow, your girl likes to spit
If your girl was my girl, I'd still love that bitch
My ginseng, viagra and a strawberry pop
From the vagina to the asshole do it again
I want a disgusting lost over Delta
I mom loved a Tymer but now you're welcome
You're alright lil mom and i love that girl
But deep down I love my cock
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me at the end of the night
You can ride with me
Because I like Simmon's jeans, I'm not trying to make a love scene
I really just want you to break me
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me at the end of the night
You can ride with me
Because I like Simmon's jeans, I'm not trying to make a love scene
I really just want you to break me
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me at the end of the night
You can ride with me
Because I like Simmon's jeans, I'm not trying to make a love scene
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me at the end of the night
You can ride with me
Because I like Simmon's jeans, I'm not trying to make a love scene
(Bangladesh)
No roofs, motherfucker
Good tires on the 'Ghini, you should want to rule me
Dead brain flow, vegetables, zucchini
I live on the beach, she walks in a bikini
I am here to distinguish bears from penguins.
Life is just a gap, put some money in the middle
This rhythm totaled, Pam, Keisha, Kima
Sitting in the world, thinking about a girl
Gun by my side, I paint you like a mural
He dug in my pocket, I got a party
Be cool before you get stomped on and you party
Hollygrove shit, I'm on my Hollygrove shit
Looking for a bad bitch, I give him dinosaur cock
Big, bad flow Weezy, fuck the politics
Elevator in my crib because it's five stories
I don't expect you to have one inside yours
Vince Young, suicide doors
Life is a bitch, now die for it
Got the kind of flow niggas that I don't have to like
My rhymes are ambidextrous, so I don't have to write
(Oh don't you know?)
The way I'm eating niggas I wish they had my appetite
Fresh out of Texas and I'm important as an Applewhite
I serve four and then knock on the exit door ('About)
Take a trip to Macy's police all over the second floor (Give me that)
Whores smell the scent of money coming out of my pores (do you smell it?)
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue boy (Haha)
I did it from a flyer to Forbes (see me?)
Young Elvis Freshley, yeah, he flies that stork (Damn)
Leave babies on your chick's cheek (Ugh), kick clean (Cool)
I have your son admiring me like he's 6 feet (Haha)
Your daughter needs someone to save her (What?), Not me (Nah)
I'm knocking down hoes like Laila (who?) Ali (yeah)
Yes, there are no ceilings, like a coliseum (no ceilings)
Flows stronger than an anvil, short
OK, it's Gudda, ho! All about my accounts like Buffalo
Purple made me move slowly, like I was in a snail race
Pop-pop-pop, 3 headshots and then I pick up my case
Leave them with a pale face, yes, I'm a young money thug
I do something rude to her, I blow her up like balloons
I pass it to Millz, then I leave it to Tune
This is a bitch with no roofs, no roof like a stadium
We close every damn place these bitches see us
Do you want us at your club? Well nigga, heathen then
BM completely gray, I'm getting it for my Baby M
She told me to get the money and count it for me when I take it out
G-U-D-D-A, propane flow
* Fragment letters *
Yes, knee bricks, huh?
Tryna shoots [?]
Put a black six underneath
Set-
Cats, snakes, chickens, ducks, seniors, and twerkers.
I present
Fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh, free, free, fresh
DJ Mannie Cool, cool, free, cool
Mannie Fresh, fre, fresh
DJ Mannie Fre, fre, fresh, ladies
Put your hands on your knees and bend your butt
Put it back, get out, hump it
Well I'll fly like a gun son, daze son
Yes, tall as a 757 going to heaven
I am the god, 1-7, Apple and E
I'm the Cash Money Makaveli, they are not ready
Quick, quick like Tom Petty, you're all mean
'82, I was born ready, I'm too ready
You all ballet blockers Betty Crocker, I'm too heavy
Meatball, Lamborghini, top spaghetti
I don't need a pool, I'm swimming in you
At the Beamer, eight hundred and forty, mom, shake me something
And it doesn't make sense if you don't earn that money
I'm going to take that money, I'm straight Cash
Whodi, I bring it back, whodettes, at the end of the maps
I take off my wing
Silent moment for the home boy Soulja Slim
Coping around here will make you cut again
We do our thing, we don't act like you
I mean, black and white walls with the back removed
All of you Lil Bustas, just a tax write-off
I'm a standing type, not the falling type
We don't breed them kindly, but they bleed very well
If you can't, boy, read my nine
I'm getting hard on the paint like Diesel's time
Either I am the most delusional cat that does it or these cats are losing it
I'm easy, I step back and be cool with it
Pallbearer is moving his dead flow, I'm done
I'm the sh - naw, naw, I'm rich in sewers
Weezy F Baby, what I do is this
An old school gangsta, mack like the 80s
I look like Cita and act like a baby
You play with me, I react like the navy
Yes and your head is a target
You don't want me to see you with my Tommys peeking out
Wizzle Fizzle, I'm still in New Orleans
A country boy in something strange
About a hundred thousand more than you are
You're not at it, you freeze like popsicles
Pop up on a bike, pop all like pimples
Wizzle Fizzle, original Hot Bizzle
Still Lil Wayne, but the dividend is not little
Don't be surprised how the crown fits him
The whole brown paper bag (Uh-Oh)
All brown paper bag: fill it with ones (Like father, like son, biatch!)
All brown paper bag: fill it with (Angel on the beat)
Fill it up: fill it up with some (I tell you I tell you)
Big choppa, I can hit you from a hundred feet
What's going on Wardy? How do you want it, friend?
I'm the president, you just play your position
And I hope that door doesn't knock on you, get out of my office crab
Don't let the sharks catch you, this beat is a car collision
Mercedes with kidneys, no, that's a Benzo
I do not put pills, no, but I put gums
Man I can get like fifty thousand in that brown bag
Yes black
Cook everything, make it whole and half a bitch!
Yeah Birdman in a Benz with the duffel bag stuffed
They're hot people by my way but we don't give a shit
We're in the rut for the shine trying to climb
A black MAC, a black 6, and a black Hummer.
They are thirteen hundred, fourteen hundred, we are getting money
Leave it, get to work, nigga, keep it running
Garbage bag full of cash nigga keeps on coming
In my Red Phantom nigga hood we'll be stunts
Got the block locked nigga, we'll be rushed
Brown canvas bag full of cash
Get up in the air
Now money cars hoes, a whole nigger knows it
Every brown paper bag, I could fill it with some
Nigga, fill it up with some, hey, fill it up with some
I think she is a stripper, dancer, dancer, dancer.
Dancer, hey, hey, put it in the thang dog
Damn, I'm popping my necklace
In a black Impala, all the demons want holla
I have the Suade on my headrest, gold on my damn bracelet
Hey, triple gold nigga, suck, I'm not getting thin
Do you want him to come look for me
I'm in 360 (Ferrari, man) Cash Money is with me
Microphone check, still can't hear my ...
Oh yes i do yes i do
Who the hell is Stevie J?
Don't look for donations
I get my cunt and then hibernation
I start humpin 'as soon as I wake up
He woke up bleeding like "who shot me?"
I kept shooting; Boo said "you got them"
Now all we have to do is get rid of the body
But still I woke up to a new punani
I was drunk like a bitch, drunk like a bitch
But not drunk like that bitch
I got into that shit, I acted donkey on it
Trash in your trunk, I hope my trunk key can fit
Then he jumped on my cock like a monkey and shit
Monkey see monkey do, banana clips
Shoot 'em niggas, no camera trouble
Wax that ass, no candles
And I run with some assassins that I eat with the mafia
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high
Look dead in my eyes, look death in my eyes
The TEC in my thigh and my aim so good
I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye
A nigga almost died but I'm out
Fuck you with a real nigga get killed
They paid me my fees, will they refund me?
I love when he grimaces
Pussy feels like vacation
Eat like I'm starving
Give Fuke if she's Caucasian
My wild niggas like Jumanji
You can call me an S.O.B
Because his skateboards on bugattis
I used to be in them heat games
With better seats than Pat Riley
Pop that Ollie, Tunechi
I met her tonight, fuck her today
You hide her, I'm fucking her face
Wine head, she is eating grapes
Rear shots, I'm holding your waist
You know, tune in to my brother, but he's not trying to meet you
Just bring your friend, we'll both eat her
They hate niggas being hungry
I have a hundred shots to feed them
Her panties are down, her legs are up
We finally fucked, she starved for months
Don't mind, I'll still hit
There are never feelings, there is no love for these hoes
Without flowers, we are simple, we fuck in the Rolls
Without flowers, we are simple, we fuck in the Rolls
Royce - trick!
Now they are angry, I told them they were
Bitches will lie, I did the same
Away from a square, don't mistake me for lame
She tells me to go on, I'm doing my thing
I give her hundreds, she keeps my change
Most women face it, but who do you blame?
I gave you cock, you gave me pussy
Female dog!
You know niggas still on probation
I get higher than expected
You know this is dedication
I'm in that kush she in that molly
Shout out my nigga Luca Brasi
I don't know this ho
Then I must run, no costumes
Tunechi, I had to dedicate it 5
Tunechi
Barbie
I've been smoking gas, killing bitches
Cover my face like a ninja
In this Alexander Wang scarf
I will drop a bag, they will lift
And then they will leave things
I will not change my hairstyle
But my niggas let it explode
Me and Weezy at LIV
You tried too much
Although Tunechi and I won
However, I'm at my pivot, I'm so crucial
Bands, I'm going to look for him, Weezy on his pedestal
Lots of gang shit, lots of gang shit
All these plates are coming up, ain't no place to hang shit
These bitches pussy though
However, I pulled them out of my pussy
Although niggas want my cookie
Because it tastes like cookie dough
Smoke, I have a free package; flow sick get a Z-pak
Blacks don't mean my race when they say "passed out."
Bitch put on the kneecap, I don't mean C. Kaep '
I'll check you out, pussy; I'll get you a free trial
You bitches ain't having fun, you get your QB fired
I am OBJ, hoes; break records like ankles
Tell them to continue, they will miss me when I'm gone
I left
I got them feeling like five stars, yeah
Your hoes launch attacks, my bitches are patient
Man i feel like a doctor yeah
She started crying and said her work was hard, yeah
Change your whip, put it in a Mercedes
Now she screams' Rest in peace to Honda
Cocaine on your navel, lick it so my tongue can go HAM
I put my face in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Make her jumpman, ayy
A yellow fly for me, I told him to come tan
Now she butter sin
A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga
And I wake up, I smell the Folgers, I don't know how I woke up
Because I was in a coma, but now I'm in the moment
Wear high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowing
The plug doesn't charge me for that
I cried tears of fucking joy
LV in my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm going
I stop with my skaters
Get them to hit you with their fucking boards
Sharp handles like pool sharks
Shoot him in the parking lot
Shoot you in the food court
Hit your crib on the steamboat
Then it disappears in the speedboat
Act like a jerk like Steve-O
Then it disappears like Ne-Yo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a bloodstain on your mink floor
That money gang, 500 gangs on that money train
And we stormed the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest son came, that's the name of your mother
He took the sugar cane to Spain, dropped a kilo and shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And Nina came, and her sister came.
And what is its name, it will be called Buka Bang
You don't even know where to blame it, that's cold
I just fucked like five hoes in my mansion
I have them feeling like they're five stars
Your hoes launch attacks, my bitches are patient
Man i feel like a doctor
She starts crying and says her work is hard.
Change your whip, put it in a Mercedes
Now she screams' Rest in peace to Honda
Change your whip, put it in a Mercedes
Now she screams' Rest Mazda in peace
Put your ass in a silly Mercedes
Now she screams' Rest in peace to Smart Car
Change it, put it in Mercedes
Now she screams' Rest in peace to Kia
Microphone check, still can't hear my ...
Oh yes i do yes i do
Who the hell is Stevie J?
You have a cock, then you book
I get my cunt and then hibernation
I woke up in a new punani
He woke up bleeding like "who shot me?"
I kept shooting Boo said "you got them"
Now all we have to do is get rid of the body
But still I woke up to a new punani
I was drunk like a bitch, drunk like a bitch
But not drunk like that bitch
I got into that shit, I acted donkey on it
Then he jumped on my cock like a monkey and shit
Monkey see monkey do, banana clips
Shoot 'em niggas, no camera trouble
Wax that ass, don't light candles
And I run with some assassins that I eat with the mafia
I got some shit built up, I keep it inside
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high
Look dead in my eyes, look death in my eyes
I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye
Wait, all the shit aside
A nigga almost died but I'm out
They paid me my fees, will they refund me?
I love when he grimaces
I'm at the finish line, your heart is racing
Give it to Fuke, if she occasionally
My wild niggas like Jumanji
You can call me an S.O.B
Because his skateboards on bugattis
Don't stop, pop that won't stop
Drinking fool, inflating a J
I met her tonight, fuck her today
You hide her, I'm fucking her face
Rear shots, I'm holding your waist
Strange, always strange ...
You know, tune in to my brother, but he's not trying to meet you
Just bring your friend, we'll both eat her
I have a hundred shots to feed them
Her panties are down, her legs are up
We finally fucked, she starved for months
Don't mind, I'll still hit
There are never feelings, there is no love for these hoes
No flowers were sent, but we fucked in the Rolls
Bitches will lie, I did the same
Away from a square, don't mistake me for lame
She is sucking me, I am rummaging through her brain
She tells me to go on, I'm doing my thing
That wet pussy, I call it rain
I give her hundreds, she keeps my change
I keep it a hundred, you do the same
I gave you cock, you gave me pussy
It's safe to say it's a uniform exchange ... bitch!
Do not give information
You know niggas still on probation
I get higher than expected
You know this is dedication
I'm in that kush she in that molly
I give that vagina to Dasani
Shout out my nigga Luca Brasi
I don't know this ho
Then I must run, no costumes
Tunechi, I had to dedicate it 5
Hammer on the dresser, work on the stove
I'm sitting at the counter blowing my nose
Bare red bone, in bed flexing
I say bitch, I'm not impressed, you must have got the wrong impression
Man we're living in hell like a deep breath
Real niggas for real money, real bitches with fake asses
If she doesn't want to fuck I get on my skateboard and I pass it
Money on the table, guns on the table
Bitch I'm in that syrup, say ho ho leggo my Eggo
And my girlfriend is a choppa, I hold my finger
Hi, I'm Tunechi: you had me hello
Man I don't fuck with any of you niggas like rednecks
We got that job, so come on and if we don't know you, you pay taxes
I put a hole in your apple, what is that?
Black pussy, I'll kill you and then I'll dance at your funeral
Blood I'll have a nigga drinking his own communion of blood
Wake up like Bone Thugs I'll call your lantern pick up the phone
Her tits are fake but they look really cubic: the zirconia
Run in your house, save the children and kill the adults
I scream at my new hoes, I scream at my old hoes
I still use that butt as a closet
Bitch, what are they going to say?
I keep eating rappers on my damn lunch break
Bad yellow bitch with a tongue like a snake
I let her suck my cock and then I fucked her with some Drake
And then I let that kush burn
Smoking gasoline bitch
The burning cabin I'm here higher and higher
Young money bitch us on top like barbed wire
Money on my mind, I'm not thinking of any bitch
I'm talking about that scratch like my itchy throat
Stop cheating if you're buying your bitch something
I stayed on the same team as Tim Duncan
Shit becomes real if you're scared, go to Catholic school
And if we want it straight jacket like a padded room
Shoot your butt 100 times and stand on you
Lil 'Tunechi, fly, I have arachnophobia
Burn bitch, AK in my firm grip
Jump if you feel like Kermit, sermons
Reach preaching and I smoke your butt like Cheech
I'll fade like bleach, double barrel: siamese
I like my obesity swisher, fuck that bitch like a cop
Fuck these greaseless enemies, they control your chin: knob
Money talks bitch and mine talks like Robin Leach
That inclination slowed me down as Lisa Turtle asked Screech.
Heavy bank card, my wallet like a bar
We will bring the O.K. Run to your doorbell
We pull the triggers, not the collars, I do lump sums: oatmeal
Trukfit money Mountain Dew money, tell them
I get better like good wine, I'm fire like cayenne
In the words of my nigga BP, I'll hit a bitch with a BOOM car bomb
Little bitch
Niggas gonna talk, they're not talking shit
Damn niggas fuck with that shit
Suck a black penis for Trukfit
And let that kush burn, let that kush
Yeah i let kush burn
Smoking gasoline bitch
The burning cabin I'm here higher and higher
Holla in a black if you want that Oscar Mayer
Yes
Stop playing with me
Cannon in my hand
And I will be condemned
Lack of respect in my land
Intercept a black man's plans
An effective black ass
I'm a firefighter, but I'm going to wet that nigga
My glass pumps liquor, I'm a special black
I'm not in front of these extra-last niggas
I'm an extra bad nigga, I'm a side shooter
Open the Maserati
Fuck the road soldiers
Because today the guys are going to
Run and tell the soldiers
So I hope the same soldier can
I find you when I lose you
Hey, these niggas talking next to them medullas
Preserve a nigga, put his body in a refrigerator
Turn them into ice, call me Weezy the jeweler
Run to me boy and smoke like Buddha
Who the hell wants to put it in your next breath?
Fire
I'm the firefighter, fire, f-firefighter, ow
You can turn it on and I'll get you out
Weezy allergic to winter - Warm
Uh, Twista, cash
Niggas shaken by Twista
Lil Weezyana state, show them heaven (uh huh)
Call a reverend, I'm gonna burn them like stair 47, with a Mac 11
With 40 cal with a clip 50
Uh, uh, you don't want a part of this (what)
Let me make your marrow, burst your oblong, call a doctor
(Uh uh)
Don't come near me acting pity while I wear Glocks to carve you (Yeah)
For tomorrow
You can break my hands, I write with my mind
You can't stop the author (yeah)
Try to run on the block, why bother?
Then I go and throw his body in a ditch
No one will find you and no one will
Talk about you because I'm a real street gangster (No)
Ghetto gangstas don't eat pasta
Kill that hole in your pussy while I'm dressed like a rasta (Papapa)
And we become scum
I'm just fucking with niggas who are winning with me
If you try, you will die
On fire because I'm so high
Look how we burn this city
I'm the firefighter, fire, f-firefighter, ow
You can turn it on and I'll get you out
Weezy allergic to winter - Warm
I'm young Birdman, and you niggas just bird food
We live in a whirlpool
You have to eat or be eaten
Don't put a hand on the door
This dog treats niggas like steak
Dinner
Take a break
My fucking mistake is perfect
Murder
Renegade music
My flows are stupid
I'm cold, I spit mucus
I'm tight as sutures
Fair, ruthless
Tied up, shoot you
We rich people sue us
Snitch let them
Ditch, sewers
Pushing Daisies, Roses, Petunias
Awakens, funerals, service, fellowship.
I'm hotter than a fucking Hot Boys reunion
Weezy
You can turn it on and I'll get you out
Weezy allergic to winter - Warm
Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the road
Music playing, the phone vibrates
In case some shit starts, I have my big dog
Wifey calls me, I answer: "Hello, honey"
"You know I hate talking and driving on the road"
"I love you"
"I love you too"
"Okay, bye bye bae"
I'm going up on a Sunday
I'm in L.I.V, here niggas with the face of "what"
And all the bitches I'm with have no foreplay
And all the niggas I'm with are in the drug trade
And all the chickens we have come from Josè
Oh shit, Lil Mom, she swallowed all my protections
Birds on the trunk, let them fly to the sky
Highway to heaven, you just got a message
O-M-W, we got off on your way out

Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the road
My passenger is on probation and cannot violate
We are attentive to all these snitches with that spy door
And all these thirsty bitches, I let them get dehydrated
Yes sir
I said, "I'm jogging right now," he said, "Okay, I'll pray."
"I love you too"
"Okay, bye bye bae"
Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the highway
Wifey only sends a text message to a black: "Be careful"
The chain on my neck looks like a King K
Okay, I'm murdering this damn highway
You can be killed on the morning of your birthday
I pulled out the [Ghost] this morning, made the streets pay
The feds bite like a damn streak
Old money, dead presidents start to decay
Money is coming back, it's on repeat
Yes sir
Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the road
Tunechi playing, the phone vibrates
Yes, Hoody follows me, that's my big dog

"You know I hate talking and driving on the road"
"I love you"
"I love you too"
"Okay, bye bye bae"
In case it starts, I have my big dog
Birds land, bitch, I'm jumping on the highway
Coming straight to you, I've been waiting for five days
I'm HoodyBaby, you can call me crazy
* Call me crazy *
I treat my plug like Sanaa Lathan
Love, I have to dance, move the work in Ferrari
Nothing in my trunk, police officer, sorry
Haha
Today was a good day
*Why?*
I have a hood full of good yay
Now I'm in the hood, with a hood full of good yay
Meetings in my mansion only the villas in the [?]
Gotta plug in white, yeah I can get you ten yay
*I have*
Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the road
Already, invisible as shit, I'm in the Hyundai
Yeah, the girl I'm with, her trunk looks like Beyonce's
If she stays down, she'll be picking up some bridesmaids
Yes sir
Hit the [?] And make him get away with it
God knows when I open this trunk things are going to fly
Wifey knows I hate talking and driving on the highway
"I love you"
"Okay, bye bye bae"
Highway to Heaven, Highway to Heaven
We have some birds in the trunk and we drive anywhere

Chickens in the trunk, I'm on the road

We met at City Walk, Universal Studios
Uhh so beautiful
Really cold
Shawty needs a movie role
I am not an actor but I keep the script
And Tony Montana made me hit the blimp
And she hit me with her fubbb
And you know I like it reddish and shawty is reddish
Uh, speeding up like a cop behind me
Tryna Catch Up With This Girl Like 57 Heinz
And you deserve lobster mommy
So how about I make shellfish reservations for now
Table for two, just you and me, some drinks and some food
Couple yeah I know it's a couple of jokes
Pattern mug
Dom Pérignon glass, hound glass
Moan cup, couple moans
And your goodies so good I can't make a bad sound
And her pussy so good, I wish I could use it for cologne
And her so wet pussy I wish I could slip and break my neck
And I took her to Rodeo, she buys all day
And I fucked Hollywood's ass like I was from Vallejo
California ca ca California
She my love from california
My California love
That girl is my California love
My California love
Because now she tells me to stop, now she says she wants to stop
Now I'm calling a stop, where's the purple? Like where the purple?
And my mom told me never to hurt a woman, but what if that woman hurts me?
And they say love is priceless, but now it's so cheap
But like Mike Tyson, we weren't sure
We only bit a dream
In that boxing ring
Now someone calls Don King
And tell Shawty, give me back my ring
Shawty give me back my ring
And the bell rang
Uhhh my Cali consists of Compton al Valle
Some stallions at Rancho Cucamongo
So run those who say, patiently waiting like a roll
Oh I have a bad one at Carson
I can't fall even though it's never been my morale, just a lot of speech
I'm young, so before we start preparing to bounce like a 6-4
Now what is your information? Sexy text i like to use a pencil
And your friends know, I'm a real GD
Young Money baby without rent
Tyga man
Hey?
Calling Lil Wayne (Wayne) a ...
...assassin!
Than? Than?
Assassin!
Than? Than?
Wait, now under the deep cover of the Lil batter
Calling me head busta
Run with me K - Blucka
Niggas done ran away from ...
If he wants to play, he busts, ...
... come kill me, busta
Beanie, halfway to my diaper head
But I don't care, I just grab my clip, slap and spray
Anywhere, no matter where a nigger stays
Just believe me when I say "guerilla war"
I swear, it will be more drama about these bags
Niggas in black drive Jags - camouflage rags
Niggas' domes open with blood and sweat
Niggas riding on Hummers - laughing, drinking Moette
You know me: Corlleon, standing four feet
I'm in a cannon cannon, using Rolies
Look, these little boys, they're not really in my game
But once I find that nigga playing Wayne, man
See when I turn you bend and then I'm on your block
But when I go out with the chop-chop, my nogga, you fall
Where are your niggas, comradie? They are not with you now
I guess you heard that when I'm riding I make the crew stop
Now are you what I am for?
If you're about what I'm doing, about the drama
Thuggin 'on broad day with four Glocks, a knife and a helicopter
I'm running away, don't get in my way
The caller calls me a murderer!
They call me murderer
They call me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My niggy, when I'm late call me what you want
Full of blunt
They call me murderer
They call me head busta, Cash Money nigga
My niggy, when I'm late call me what you want
Full of blunt
Now while the heat burns
They're looking down the street, they think they see Wayne's truck
The whole block doesn't scare me because it gets me something and bust
Now U.P.T. Baja - picador city in the ghetto, my man
Now who's in the car with the helicopter? Oh it's Lil Wayne
Give me that rag, you're not a soldier, wipe the blood off my chain
I'm getting blisty ...
... off in a black F-150
'About to do the usual: hit your block, just spit'
Heads spinning like a set of seventeen or something
Because they
(-Hook [Lil Wayne])
Original Hot Boy - Crossing Earth with Guns
I'll be the one to burn the block
Never get lost when I spread anger in my Cali
Hundred automatic shots
Leave you hopeless in the alley
If the black loved his life, he would have his weapons raised
... and I have boys who have toys to stop the noise
Look, when I go in the Hummer, leave it empty
Now he catches three because he wants meat
Now, I tried to say to the stupid boy, "Don't mess with me."
Now look at him, open his coffin and look
Click-clack my mack, flip my Philly cap back
Jump on the nigga and yell "war", and just "pow! Pow!"
How do you love me now With five barrels in sight
What the hell? Fill a clip of four and four
They'll drive you crazy for running over the edge
Who is behind the flame of the gun? ...
It's mister Wayne
-Me!
Look they call me a murderer
Hey?
Because they call me murderer
Than?
They niggas call me a killer
They call me head busta, Cash Money nigga
Than?
Calling me a murderer
(Assassin)
Assassin!
Hello motherfuckers, it's Weezy Baby
I miss you like the damned O'bannons
That's the AK-47, make your neighborhood love me
Don't do that bird shit, he's got a weak stomach
Niggas knows I'm sick, I don't spit, I vomit, got it?
Simon says "shoot a black man in the thigh and leg"
These other niggas dope, I'm wet crack baby
Yes, come back, come back boy, this is a setback
Clumsy niggas slip and fall into a debt trap
They boys pussy, born without a spine
And if it was tied, we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet them, I hope you have put on the towel
I aim at your moon and put on my howl
And when it comes to that paper, I stack books
Did you hear what i said
I can stand you up or put some money on your head
Life is not cheap, you better die if you can't pay the fee
Shout out my nigga fare
See all the motherfuckers at the door don't get a key
You're outside looking in, so tell me what you see
It's about money, it's bigger than me
I tell my friends: "don't kill him, bring me the black one"
Yes, don't miss, you're fucking the hitman
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again
Directly, I have no conversation for you
Nigga talk to the (Cannon)
Yes, have a few words with him (Cannon)
Yes, tell my motherfucker (Cannon)
Directly, I have no conversation for you
Nigga talk to the (Cannon)
From Philadelphia to where I'm landing, I'm a (Canyon)
And I'm in that Philly fight shit and I come fully equipped
Your car, you cum, you keep Nina and Shotty in the whip
If a nigga tries to hit me, I'll criticize him
Sing now, di-di-dadi, I'm free, I have the butters
I have the green, it has the tan, it has the whole enchilada
You owe me dough, I'm inside your house, tie you brother
Make the prick call your mother, she might know where to find you
I'm on top of my job, heavyweight champion of flowers
Flow like the ocean, open water, drowning you, I will
Sharks surround it and eat it, it is good to know it, I will
Run over your squad like it's "One Punch" Carr
Take control of your soldiers, you won't miss them
I make it hard for rap niggas, I'm peer pressure
In fact, I'm motivated to rap better
I showed black people how to act, how to dress better
I stay cool, caps tighter than bad receivers
I am the crack, the blow, the gun, the rule
The gat, the leash, the weapon, the tool.
Motherfucker (cannon)
In other words, I'm real, really
We can go check by check or invoice by invoice
We can go girl by girl or skill by skill
The deal's sealed, niggas ain't real like Will cause I'm a (Cannon)
And I handle myself well, I pedal like Cannondale
And I got the 50 cal mag, it's a handheld (Cannon)
I tell you niggas, I explode, I put a shell on your niggas
I have whores on the Canon camcorder bending
Blowing 'ghan for quarters, grass smell on the rover, nigga
Detroit Red is changing like them, whites
Pain like a bitch like the first day of a cycle.
You better run when I pull the (cannon)
I love the head and caress a voluptuous ass
I ask you baby, mom, is she ready for homework?
She likes "Damn Red, he's bigger than (Cannon)"
Get caught slipping with you and die
Where I'm from niggas, hurry to squeeze the (Canyon)
Detroit Red always has some shit in your ear
Show me love but keep it moving, man, cause if you get close
I'll say get off my cock and tell the bitch to come here
Because you're sweating me and my DJ Don (Cannon)
Legs spread far, you know how I'm standing
I got niggas who don't like rap loving our shit
These niggas can't see me like I ain't been around lately
Salty niggas, I'm pepper, not Spinderella
Yes, Vic found out that licking now we don't smoke anymore
Keep it halfway through, I don't think you don't know better
They love "In Da Trunk", now they want to hear more shit
I play it modestly like "nigga, that's one of our old things"
I got niggas I've never met wanting to fight me
Do you have hoes in love asking "why don't you like me"?
Bitch I'm married to the game and I love my wife
Outperforming the competition, man, I love these Nike
Yes, I am hot, they are fanning themselves
Niggas try to copy my style like the Canon
Don't try to compare, I'm in a league of my own
All data is turned off, your information is invalid
Artist of the century, competition is unbalanced
It is true as Master P and his two brothers.
Don't call it incest, but Juice the motherfucker, like
Chyeah
Good morning new york
Good night america
This is young money ... Nikki Minage
They don't make us break, I'm not with the bakers
I am getting bread in fear in Jamaica
Are they young stunners
Nikk-Im the girl who goes looking for her as Jeezy
Take a step forward or pass this year
Yeah it's fair that the whole block is there
The air leapt into the blue and white cape
I'm here, I'm on, long hair, I don't care
Remain motionless in my ear, because my ear is dazzled
Now it's hard to find me
Up behind me
You will be Harry Potter and I will be Hermione
I will arrive early
I'm a girl, the girl that they
Call 1 like it's my first birthday
I'm in that range rov
Honkin that Kango
That red pussy because it tastes like mango
YA..dig
So I guess it's my turn, and I'm going to go to the heads of blacks like sideburns
Big Phantom on the road, take a wide turn
Nikki since I've been rappin, this is what I've learned
All these other niggas fuck like dry sperm
And I play this shit like Tom Hearns
If it's not money, don't worry
And never give a bitch what I've earned
Fuck I look like?
I'm looking for a bitch that can fuck well, cook well
And if not, then right left foot
And my hoes speak like "HssHswAsh"
And I'm just saying "Right"
We don't worry about fighting
She is just ... just ... fair
Diggggggggg already?
I'm on tour until my money like the height of the bus
The ice seems bright, watch me come like bus lights
Weezy ...
Nikki ... Minage ...
Young Money...
You can't break what can't be broken
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen
And all the curtains, they close
You can't break what can't be broken
They can do everything they can but cannot break unwavering
They fear facing the truth because they hate the sight
They taste the juice, I hope it makes them vomit, I'm letting go
In 1982 my mom recorded me on a space shuttle
Let's say now that I'm raising you and there's no baby food
Unless you go and take food from the neighbors
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from military green to navy blue
I said hello, bulletproof, I gave them proof
Sometimes I feel like my head is a screw, twisted like a tornado's too
Its walls is what I'm breaking
Her nails, she broke some
You can never knock me down, and I can't stop for you
(errr!)
You can't break what can't be broken
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen (Yes)
When all the lights go down (Low)
And all the curtains, they close (they close)
You can't break (you can't) what can't be broken
G code, G code, we can't break G code
We bros (can't break)
We are brothers, we are brothers, we cannot break because of these hoes
G code (cannot be broken)
I will not break or fix the brakes
You listen to me late, I'm laughing in your face
Now fix your face, I can not disintegrate, because I provide a thousand a day
For like a million days
I'm really cool, but don't discriminate
Because I have seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You pull out your chest, your boobs are fake
Don't make me choose your destiny
I'm smoking disgusting, watching Ricki Lake
I have an attorney who turns any case into a pillowcase
My straight killers, let's ask some questions and answers
Saw the news today
I have news to break and rules to break
It hurts to say they want Lil Tune to break
Worth waiting for, commercial break
You can't break down what can't be broken (G code)
Out of all the rain clouds, I was chosen
When all the lights go down
And all the curtains, they close
G code, G code, we can't break G code
We bros (can't break)
We are brothers, we are brothers, we cannot break through these hoes, code G
I can't help but wait
I can't help but wait, check it out
I see you, you're with him, he's not right but you don't stumble
I can't bear to see your face with those tears running down your cheeks
But what can I do? I must be faithful, because deep down I am still a G
And I don't want to come between you and your man
Although I know I'll treat you better than him
Girl I can't help but wait
Until we see each other for who you really are (baby you're a star)
And I can't help but wait
It's not cool, just letting it make the decisions
You're a queen, you should be, getting everything someone has
You are worth much more than an occasional "I love you", "I am thinking of you"
Although I know I'll treat you better than him
Girl I can't help but wait
Seeing is believing, and I see what you need
I'm going to play my position, let you catch what you were missing
I'm calling! Girl cause i can't help but wait
I can't help but wait, I can't help but wait, I can't help but wait, no, no, no
Bundle of six feet, seven feet, eight feet
Bundle of six feet, seven feet, eight feet
Ahem, excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money Militia and I am the Commissioner
You don't want to 'start Weezy' because the 'F' is for the finisher
So misunderstood, but what is a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
I've got the girl twisted because she opens up when you twist her
I never knew the bitch, but I fucked her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister.
You know father's time, and we all know mother nature
Everything is in the family, but I have no relationship.
Black and white diamonds; shit segregation
Fuck that shit, my money, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money running shit, and you niggas just runners-up
I don't feel like I've done enough so I'll keep doing this shit
Bundle of six feet, seven feet, eight feet
Well I lost my mind, it's somewhere stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Did this woman named Tammy break my heart?
But hoes will be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
I just talked to moms and told her she was the sweetest.
I beat him up; call it self defense
I swear, man, I'll be looking through these sequins niggas
Niggas think it's He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talking to myself because I'm my own consultant
Married to money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You're full of shit, you shut your mouth and let your ass speak
Young money eatin ', all you hate to do is add salt
Stop playing, bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
But these motherfuckers talk like crazy like they have a broken jaw
You know I'm a ball until the field lights go out
The fruits of my work, I enjoy them while they still ripen
Bitch, stop playing, I do it like a king
I'm telling the truth, but I guess it's a foreign language for all of you
And I call it what I see it, and my glasses
But most of you don't understand the image, except the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing, you don't even know half
Young Money Cash Money
Bitch, the real Gs move silently like lasagna
People say I'm almost crazy, something like that
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her.
You niggas are jelly, peanut for an elephant
I ended that sentence as a subject and a predicate
Yeah with a loot you would kill for
Money is too strong. pockets on bodybuilder
I jumped in a good wish, now wish me well
Tell them to kiss my butt, call it a kiss and tell it
Word to my mom, I'm out of my bean
I don't want to see what that drama means
Cry flame, hotter than the summer sun in a Ghanaian queen
Now all I want is punches, bitch, Wayne signed a demon
I played next to you niggas who's trying to be up front, and I see
Son of a gun, son of Sam, your nigga is my son
Pause for this dumbest speech, I shine like Buddha
Bitch, I flow like a diver, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a murderer, she's going to exploit you
I'm mackin ', on my stackin', now I pack like a motor
Niggas think they're tall like me, I come to laugh at your ruler
Cold cash, bitch, but our stocks are colder
Wayne, these niggas care
That I keep your money on my mind
Get these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
Keep throwing my poster in the middle
Hit them, piece next to me
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune told me to shoot when the funeral was
I'm high class, thoroughbred, a black BX, did you hear it? Gunna

Back off, cause I do this here
Take a step forward or you'll finish this year
Yes, it is correct that the whole block looks
The air leapt into the blue and white cape
I'm here, I'm with long hair, I don't care

Now it's not hard to find me, up behind me
You will be Harry Potter and I will be Hermione
I'm early, I'm the girl that they
Call The One like my first birthday

Do you already dig? (Go!) So I guess it's my turn
And I'm going to go to the head of blacks like sideburns
Big Phantom on the road, take a wide turn
Big light green buds, is what I burn
If it's not about money, don't worry
A paper hunter until my thigh burns
And never give a bitch what I've earned
Fuck I look like?

If not; then, left foot, right
Foot, get to step on, yes bitch, walk light

Ice looking bright, watch me come like bus lights
Weezy, Nicki Minaj, Young Money
Oh my God
Uh
I turned my mansion into a juug house
I did a TV show with Jesse outside of Full House
Oh lord, I turned my mansion into a house ho
I did a show in Haiti, I bought the Zoes
I get out in the car with my head lost, hoes
Mouth shut, don't feed on shit in the cold drought
I left the court with a ride, bounce and no doubt
I know I'm not lazy if Hov responds, my doors burst
I help my brother and get him out of the drug house
I never sold strong from that old sofa that unfolds
Like I pronounce I'm a whole ounce
Stank as strong as an old trout and toes
Make these hoes duck, then roll, bounce, then roll
And kick rocks, I started with six rocks, oh lord (Woo)
Let it breathe
I started with six rocks
Won $ 30, thank goodness for hip hop
And I hit the block with my palms itching like chickenpox
Bop jiggy bop, my hot niggas, my bitch a fox
You all niggas tease, you bit my booty like little pots
Don't squat over any man or city police
Gun in my sock, no lollipops, licking shots
He was lashing rocks all day, oh how I saw
Then they shot me and then I fell, then in shock
Lying in that hospital room as soon as the doctor calls
You know I jumped, bounced like a shakala boom
He got rich at 15 and moved to mom
It started with six rocks, now it's a mountain
I've never been a fan of common ground
I've turned green since Bobby Brown
And when you visit, I'm not around
I hope your eyesight is not off limits
I come to do business, so for your new niggas hiding frowns
Ooh, but my mansion is still a house ho
I did a show at home, I bought my brothers and I had no enemies
I go out in the coupe with the doors out, the whores out
I know how to move with my nose down
Keep my nose away from people's business, news, and "hoes" because these jams are bad
My goose porridge, I'm from Eagle Street, daughter of Hollygrove
I used to have the Nissan with Bose sound, I drove
Chrome 44 with the golden snout, take your crown
Yeah i guess now i'm hoin
I've turned green, I mean more than cows
I've been meaning to settle down, but I'll be juggling like a clown
And if she's gullible, I like her style
If she is bisexual, I kick her out
And if it's flexible, if it's flexible, I'll wrap it up
Get head and pussy, call it toga and mortarboard
Oh Lord
No roofs
No feelings
All of you in your feelings
I'm like fucking your feelings
Mannie Fresh on the beat
So you got so far
Us up
I leave you here
Your special
Marley, don't shoot them
Do you know what is it
It's still Tha Carter II, folks
It's still Tha Carter II, folks
Yeah you're still in Tha Carter II, folks
Hears! Yes
A handful of dollars
A list full of problems.
I address them as P.O. boxes
The Creole cabin
We are so out of it
Gangsta gumbo, I'll serve you a pot
I'm rich, still fucking that block shit
Wet your butt, from head to toe, until your stockings drip
Stop throwing rocks at bulletproof glass
That's cash honey cake
We are not running, we are not hiding
Screaming "Fuck the other side"
Don't get caught
This is the deadliest routine
I put your heart into it
And walk on it
How they track you
After deleting you?
Look around
We at war
And you're still in preparation
Without patience
Slow paper
Quick money doesn't last too long
You have to know that role
If you got it from a caper
Feds walls with my photos on them
I don't do too many poses, I look great
Career thief
Make your career take
I'm back, like a bra hook
Bitch, joy
Camouflage equipment
The hunter is here.
You're just a deer
Here
And this here is Tha Carter
Serve while it's hot
Out the pot to your mom
And Slim tell me there's no one sexier
But give your son some sauce
I have them by the neck
Watch me drop them
On the head, at the bottom
And you don't have to shoot them
Because I already shot them
Because i already have them
get em

She says "what's going on?"
I say "wassup wassup"
She asks "what's wrong with me"
I say "what about us"
I say "what is really good?"
I put my love
She says "it's really good"
She says "it feels good"
I say "I feel better"
I'm a nasty boy
Dont ask me why
Just ask me how and I'll show you proud
Her head is gone, she's in the clouds
And when it rains, man she spills
And I'm the boy without an umbrella
Ma, you are finer than a cellar
Fuck nigga, they fuck niggas
My blunt bigger than these little niggas
Keep doing stunts with your bitch ass
You'll be jacked and jilled, nigga
Fuck these black ladybugs?
I'm spending money, spending money
Ben Franklin dizzy black!
Your bitch on my dick, I said I was busy
She says "Wayne on me, Wayne on me" because your ass is drizzling
That pussy came gift wrapped: bow and ribbon
And if she bounces that butt then I'm dribblin
There is only one me, there is no equivalent
She gives me brains, brains like trivia
I got a black bitch and a red bitch
I call them hoes Aunt Vivian
Chopper takes your face away
Black Shadows, Ray Charles
I have your ho in my cemetery
I am not working with a complete deck
But I pull out that Ace card
Hanging clips, no curfew
I'm shining like church shoes
Birdman Jr .: all of you bird food
I'm about to ... I said I'm about to cum
Bitch I'm sleepy
Man I'm so stoned I don't know what I'm laughing at
I have bars, nigga and it's happy hour!
Ridin 'hang around with them choppas, not them girls
Ridin 'with a bitch named Molly and her in Molly - ha!
Man these niggas can't see me like a newspaper
I close one eye, I look like a pirate, fuck it!
TRUKFIT my bitch, Tunechi leaves big nuts
I'm sucking my dick
I blow grass like dust!
Spacehead: Pussy love, Federal hate
Told him to drive it like he had 8 legs
That Mack-11: necessary
I'm a tough head: I explode the cherry
No pussy, no rats, no Tom and Jerry
Do they say your friends are your enemies?
Well, my friends are imaginary.
My cold ride and my hot bitch
I don't gas, bitch, or pit stop
Smoke Barney and Baby Bop!
You all niggas act like cops
My niggas smoke like coffee shops
That's gang syrup, wafflehouse
Shooting, I'll knock you out
My bitch tits are coming out
We show up and we get it
Mask, gloves on
Like Mickey Mouse, the clips stick out
Like Nicki's ass
Weezy F: I'm big and bad
Little feet, but I kick your ass
I'm the trigger man, and that shooting star
Eat that pussy like caviar
She treats that dick like a straw
How do you like apples, Microsoft?
Now clean it ...
I do Liv on Sundays: church!
I got the ball, playing keepaway
Kidnap your butt, kill your butt
So hide your behind like an Easter egg!
It's Hollygrove to my deathbed
Hit a nigger with a million shots
What do you call that One million dollars
Good grass, we pass
Money talks: mine has a nasty mouth
It's young money, cash
Until the damn day I am withdrawing money!
Tunechi!
Your bitch wants to come here where the grass is greener
And if you pass that grass, I'm the wide receiver
@LilTunechi, follow leader Bitch!
I keep pimpin
I keep pimpin
I, I, I'm still pimpin
I have a bitch in the back, I have a ho in the front
One cooking the crack, a rollin gives forceful
You get pussy and ass from a beautiful and wide
If you look for that holla in cha boy
I'm an m-m-mack mack a p-p-pimp
I sp-sp-sp-spit shrimp
I get up clean, I limp
I walk like (?)
I speak like bi, bitch, get chere
The best beach on my team when I dance feminine joy
This jacket these shoes don't come out this year
So if you love yourself girl, don't let her out this year
If you leave her out there she will come here
And that's not fair but I don't care
I'm a damn cash millionaire Yes!
Who do you think you're fucking resourceful (Bitch!)
Who do you think you are damn wit?
Who do you think you are damn wit?
I have $ 25 on my dresser and yeah
Give it to me, ho she's going to bring back
Not a ... minute, she won't get that loot
And if you don't have money, she won't catch you
Take a hit of that fruit, stand with Wayne
Fly with Birdman Jr., say hi to planes
Say goodbye to the lanes, don't buy the game
If you haven't dialed in the first half, your butt
If you play with my money, I'm a lyncher
I'm going to John Lynch, shit, don't tempt me, bitch. Oh!
Clean me because I'm very rich
And that's not fair but I don't care
I'm a damn Cash Money Millionare Yeah!
I sit in the car, I sit in the truck
Lie down in the front of the plane, lie down in the back of the bus
I have ladies for days, I have women for months
I leave you girl at home I made 21
I have them inside, they make me an empty one
Pull the eggs aside for a nice one, like
What's good, mommy, come make a cloud pillow, come fly with me
My diamonds sing, my grass is rap
Call me Weezy Da King or call me Weezy Da Crack
If pimpin is dead, I'll bring him back
In fact, neva died, so I get it back
If your shoes are too small, take that
Because you will walk all day until you come back
And that's not fair but I don't care
(hook) 2x
Who do you think you are damn wit ...? (Repeat)
I'm a damn cash millionaire, naire, naire ... (repeats 4x)
(Birdman introduces Wayne)
(Little Wayne)
Ok ... listen ...
Pushes a hairless whip on her head
So all I feel is air in my head
With something broad that you might know
I suck the crisp out of my head
Try to get my loot
Also the prices are cooler
I go back to the hood with that dirty
I have women in them, 30 call daddy Weezy
But Weezy is not daddy
Cus Weezy enters and leaves cheap
Weezy never cuffs you
Weezy gives shhh about cha
Weezy no master suite, Weezy living room sofa ya
How about you're a good girl, take these cakes that I just cooked
Take me to those tiger paws on your thighs
Get up high until you can't focus, but the main focus is to stay focused, they are not focused ... holla again
(Birdman speaking ...)
(Little Wayne)
Where you listen it sounds like click, chirp, pow!
Get off or you're dying
People who use iron have that coke flying like birds, not those with feathers, I am talking about weight like birds and they may serve you if it is adequate enough or make you nervous if you are a copper or something just like a blocker ballet player or something, I'll send your hundred noggin, I've got the whole block running, running, running and running
Kind of life I live Gotti would love
No one can put anyone above
If they do, they find their body with their body on top, we are going to make it public
No, leave it in the gutter
Yeah let's quit
No, leave it in the gutter
(Birdman speaks again ...)
(Cadillac)
Register ...
Now I have this game in the lock with pounds and chickens
Give me 600 an ounce and 10 for the pigeons.
I flood my community, I love this shhh
I think the EDF ended up in my house and annoyed the shhh
Now I'm handling everything from the hallway on the blizzock
And I'm riding on the vol with my dog without tizzop
I have a 40 on the armrest and on the lap is the glizzock
I did a little platinum and blessed it with rizzocks
And when they hear that new Weezy
All the boys in the crowd go crazy
And watch the guys in the crowd go crazy
Weezy f. You heard, I do it for the money baby, that's my word
And when they hear that new weezy it reminds them of that old baby
93 94 baby yeah before the stun yeah the real bird man
I'm the Birdman Jr
Yes, I got into the game as a young man with no sisters or brothers
All I had was some money (yeah)
Learn to work the stove and oven
The pot running over hot water
Throw an 8-ball into it, watch it come back stronger (harder)
That's what they scream loud like Aretha
And for them, Franklins, we appear in the ceaser
Ridin round with the whole block with speakers (yes)
Having a cigar and a shot of tequila (patron)
I used to wear two socks with my sneakers (hey)
When I was putting all my rocks in my slippers
Yeah but now i'm talking about speakers
I'm older, I'm rocking with divas, yeah
I could rock them to sleep
But I'd rather be home straight rockin the kibeler
I'm in the traffic coil and weavin
I'm in and out like pussy and penis
It's lunch time, I'm a genius cook (yeah)
20 for Serena 10 for Venus
Yes i can take you higher than a tennis skirt
I never filled out an application, I have a lot of work
I'm looking at 24 bricks on the counter
I'll make them disappear in 24 hours (disappeared)
(yeah) i'm really that honest that hot boy shit that's really way behind us
We could hook a black on consignment
And for the rest of his life we keep an eye on them
Bad business, fuck you pay me
Oh you had a fire, fuck me, pay me
I could run up to 80 in a week
But I can make a quarter of a million dollars on 1 street
Top in the one foot set
Then I landed in two and walked by
What can you do when you live like me?
Fly in the house, leave the pimp on the street
As quiet as a mouse when you walk down the street
If you are looking for a job, you will probably find me
And in the humble the number is still cheap
But the judge got numbers for a nigga to rise
Yes, from a young man to a g
Baby Weezy from Key Pack
And watch the guys in the crowd go crazy
Weezy f. You heard, I do it for the money baby, that's my word
And when they hear that new weezy it reminds them of that old baby
93 94 baby yeah before the stun yeah the real bird man
I'm the bird man jr
I remember having a mouth full of gold out of control
And I took the game off the ground, I put the game down
I never thought that when I see the light I will see the shades of the limousine screeching with the strips of the street
This is the family friend where G's man is with hammers on them
Nigga where lil g has great straps in the game, nigga the g had great macs, yeah
Call your national guard niggas' cause we don't give a shit, pull your nigga shit out of the car
And I remember when I first saw Puff Nigga, he was on the projects, camouflaged, black.
How to fuck them in shiny outfits, we hoodie black white t-shirts, it's what we do
Yeah nigga young and hard we fuck the other enemies, the man we are is standing
Nigga jumped in the same lane, the same niggas yelled the same
Like 93 was not a shame that a black man plays with me and I'm going to burst his mother with the brain
I'm gonna cook a nigga thing, give it to Lil Homie, keep the nigga change
Boys deep in the flame know he's nothing but the king bling bling
Certificate of man made, me and j.r, so kiss a nicca pinky ring
And watch the guys in the crowd go crazy
Weezy f. You heard, I do it for the money baby, that's my word
And when they hear that new weezy it reminds them of that old baby
93 94 baby yeah before the stun yeah the real bird man
I'm the Birdman jr
I say Young Weezy F. Baby, the hottest nigga on the block
I used to buy sickles, now I really motivated
Lift a front wheel
Relax on the pillow with your girl, he raised her heels
She tries to get my roofs
Relax when you sit down some say I'm one of those truest niggas
The truest nigga, the most illustrious nigga
She heals this nigga, we cool this nigga
We drink 'we don't drink', and we think 'immerse ourselves' in the skinny jacuzzi
She understands me, she must repeat the procedure
Until she catches me, she has me fine, so fine until I ohh
Once she got me, she gotta get Mack Maine
Because mommy, he's like me, my nigga from Holly-Grove
And speaking of bread, my shit came straight out of France
I'm not that type to dance, I can't, I really can't
I am not, I really am not
I'm Wayne, I'm very hot
I'm Wayne, I'm very hot
I'm Wayne, I'm very hot
Tha pain, tha? Yes
I'm in the game going hard, trying to get the hoop
And if you tarnish it and you dodge black
Go on, be a beach, walk away nigga
Get away from black
Get away from black
Go on, be a beach, walk away nigga
Get away from black
Get away from black
On tiptoe on the sideline, get down when you see the referee
Like T.O., the eagles in my sock, I hide mine
I have my game unlocked, I can find mine
Shit niggas like a combine
I have steroids for heroin
They put me in touch with Barry, who ... says I'm psycho
Mommy tell me crazy, go crazy like a wink
I'm waving to a technician yeah
Myself, I go to war with ATF, yeah
Be myself, I don't have to be anyone else, yeah
Damn, he really has me so after I leave
Coming by the belts, who is the mothafuckin champion?
Modafuckin holding on a black (?)
Standing at the front door like
DoDoDoDo, let me in!
DoDoDoDo, let me in!
DoDoDoDo, let me in!
I'm in the game going hard, trying to get the hoop
And if you tarnish it and you dodge black
Go on, be a beach, walk away nigga
Go on, be a beach, walk away nigga
Get away from black
Get away from black
Throw it off the board, tell 'em niggas to line up
I shoot at them and target Birdman's log
I saw the hot spit, him this offseason
Got the cheerleaders, they even really like them
I mean, the girls kiss here even
Mehn, this bird is just competition (fuck it)
Opposite, to the opposition (to hell)
I have to be the moment of my position
If you try to stay in my position
I got the proposal from the CEO
Hello, what do you know about the CEO blowing up guns?
Mofucker, that's the CEO's proposal
Hello, what do you know about the CEO blowing up guns?
I'm in the game going hard, trying to get the hoop
And if I have it, I'm a shot for the team
And if you tarnish it and you dodge black
Get away from black
Go on, be a beach, walk away nigga
Get away from black
Get away from black
Go on, be a beach, walk away nigga

Verse 1 (Lil Wayne)
Cooler than a cocaine dealer
I have work under the stairs, I have the gun in the bushes
Someone wants meat, come meet the butcher
Get punk out of a nigga like Ashton Kutcher
Pay me! like nasty prostitutes
I have that recipe, they tell me to pass the cookbook
Damn lil weezy baby wit that's a good look
So get into the good book and sha mon '
I'm not really that nigga you would like to face
I put your whole life in your front yard ... come on
Son in that shit that has nothing, weapon in
I can drive the whip and work the tool with one arm
I'm telling you not to stumble, I'm running with this bitch, a nigga who just got his trick
Chorus (Rick Ross)
I have a bird in the bag and the bag on my back
Clear the scene!
Clear the scene!
Clear the scene
Let the g do what they think X2
Verse 2 Rescue
You bastards will get it from me
You stick your lip out and shoot yourself, man!
I make them skinny and rockers like Dem Franchise Boyz!
You couldn't face me, nigga, there's no doubt about me
They gave it to me, don't spell it for me
Jersey boy, I have the whole city that could answer for me
Don't try to play Homie, I'll take out eighty and fade you away
Put what you were thinking in your blouse
This is a great newbie, rescue, pray for me
Serve raw, until I'm thirty-four, that's a boy sweater
Thats weezy f, rescue, fat yeah!
Verse 3 Rick Ross
I'm going to whip that drug like a nigga what am I supposed to do
A hundred thousand whips of dollars when the boat rolls
Triple c's, my people we triple g's, while you look all crooked, my niggas rush to squeeze!
I slapped you with the four five, bitch you rap
When it comes to weight, when Rick Ross maximizes it
I'm the one they ask, in the aston martin, grass sparkin, throwing ashes
Rick Ross will never invite you out
When I get your number, I'll come catch your damn mouth
?? 3 5 7 can't touch this
I-9 5, I traffic my body weight, in the big benz of the body, I have the whole body straight!
You directly!? I hope your ass is
I'll leave your ass as it is
Chorus
(Juice 808)
Look what you made me do
Me! That's who
Sorry for the wait, sorry for the wait (Tell them, tell them!)
Tha Carter is going to be late, so I made a tape (Tell him!)
The garden is full of snakes, so I had to escape
Lil Homie is going to be straight, Lil Homie is going to be straight.
Court! OH!
And this I'm sorry 4 The wait 2
I told myself to save myself
Because I can't save you (I can't save you)
I send my thugs to kill someone
I need a head test (I need a head test)
Fuck it (fuck it!) This sorry 4 Waiting 2
I'm not tripping, I have Barbie, I also have Drake (I'm not tripping!)
I send my thugs to kill someone, I need a head test (Mule!)
Then they come and sit it on my coffee table
Who held this shit together? Nigga, me, that's who (nigga, me!)
Who was there when the niggas left us? Nigga, me, that's who
And if those niggas come for me, I'll come out like Tony
(Bap-bap-bap-bap)
I just want my money (I want my money)
I don't have to have any conversation
Neither my luggage (nor my luggage)
Woo, Birdman Junior - more like Ugly Duckling
Takin 'over, now I'm takin' over, yeah (now I'm takin 'over)
Think about it? Bitch, I'm thinking forward, ta
All I got is Young Money, no more cash, nigga, ayy!
And this I'm sorry 4 The wait 2
I am no longer my brother's keeper: Cain and Abel
Strong young money, I'm still eating
I just broke my tooth (Mule!)
Tell 'em niggas, ain't no love lost cause I ain't got nothing to lose
Because I can't save you (I can't save you)
I send my thugs to kill someone
Sir, I must have a blurred vision, a black has two faces (amen)
Blood, you have to protect your neck
It'll suck you dry like raisins, Lord
But fuck that, nigga, you got it out
The day you met me is the day hell froze
The day I left is when it thawed (ayy!)
I just had to knock down a couple of walls, I had to kick them (ayy)
Life is a movie, but sometimes a black man gets too tired of watching
And go out
He released Sorry 4 The Wait until the wait is over
Drinking a flask, nigga
And all I do is smoke, fuck and hit, nigga, ayy!
I send my thugs to kill someone, I need a head test
Then they come and sit it on my coffee table
Tunechi - blacks don't appreciate you (they don't appreciate you)
You've been depressed from day one
It didn't mean anything on day two (damn)
Sometimes the truth is difficult to swallow, and also to say
The old me dead and gone, that's why I'm praying
Microphone check 12 or only 1-2
I'm the one who fucks you
And I'm 1-2 tall, you should admire me
My French girls love it when we smoke
On the fronts below I do it and we smoke
I make myself, she feels like I'm a new tooth
I have paper like cut sheets
My bodies are unique like the systematic chapter
I should cut myself to see if my blood is red
Married to the money
And if she lets me bury money
And when you're not good, then your arrogance is fun
He entered the game when he was young
Signed with cash money, pocket fulla money
Niggas pop shit, always talking about something
See you in public, it's a completely different topic
Man they just talk about it just talk about it
Look where I come from, you have to be about it
And if you want you want it, we come to see it
Ok uhh
It's weezy baby like the last shit
A big car and a bad bitch, uhh
I'm so flying, I need to get my ass kicked
These niggas dance by accident, uhh
Keep talking nigga, fuck your body
Send you home and tell your mother it was an accident, uhh
Haha, I'm a G until the coffin falls on my glasses, uhh
Quick money, I'm the fastest
I have that scammer's passion, you know
They boys back at the end
Okay, it was a murder, bitch, I do a kill
Insurance documents and safe money on the roof, uh
Go through a black house and aim for the pillows, uh
Yes, wake up, wake up, fucking with them boys
You will wake up recorded, you dig
Now go drink that lake and stick them in the trunk
Cause I'm swimming in dollars, bitch
Yes Yes Yes
Too hot, cold, uh, I'm red hot, cold blue
I'll hit your melon with your fruit bowl
All my black weapons, I have a true soul, yes
And I call my coupe black panther blah blah blah
That's the gat hymn and if a black man plays with the family.
I'm a smoke, so many niggas, I'm a catch cancer, c'yeah
And if I get out of this Benz'o, you know
So I'm rolling out my window, fuck 'em
Carry weapons guerrilla war time baby
Turn blisters on, light up dawg block time
Choppers with drums, uzi and Glock time dawg
Murk Whoever's with him, they better part because this is the night
And whoever is not hit, jump the whip and do it right
Then we run into his house, we see someone and we take them out
Then we empty the clips and let the Lord solve them
I really agree, it doesn't stop me because I hang onto that Dilly
And now I'm tying my scarf and I'm turning
Jump out of the Hummer, send a hundred to your cap
Dawg we have automatic, two shooters, six shots and 50 round drums
Hit your dad, your sister, your son, your wife and move your mom
Cause I'm off the wall, off the hook, off the chain
I got a saw, tec and I'm about to rip your brain out
Tell them '
Nigga Come on, Nigga Come on Wodie!
Come on, nigga Come on, it's time to do it nigga
Nigga Come on, Nigga Come on Wodie!
If the drama comes to me then it comes
For that I got two Glocks and a K with a drum
That's what I walk with, not what I ducked
The mac, the sweeper, the six shots, the bomb that cut
I got the tillery when beef kick
I have soldiers ready to march when that meat begins
Got niggas ready to kill when the shit turns real
I got niggas playing all the skirts of the field
So get caught in that place and your brain spills
You got blues, it's all the duck will be next
I don't shoot to hit I shoot to kill
Believe me, I don't shoot for fun when I shoot, it's real
Come on nigga!
Come on, nigga Come on, it's time to do it nigga
Come on, nigga Come on, it's time to do it nigga
Nigga Come on, Nigga Come on Wodie!
My nuts hung nigga, ever since I was young nigga
I get silly black, with black M-1
I take some black and turn some black
Ready for war, but I'm not the captain of any damn tank!
I'm burning, I'm on fire, you're smelling boy
Because I will come with the hood down
Letting them know what the chop sounds like
Assault rifle with drum and wobbly beam
38 with a speed charger in my case
I'm off the wall, off the hook, off the chain
Tell them '
Come on, nigga Come on, it's time to do it nigga
Nigga Come on, Nigga Come on Wodie!
Come on, nigga Come on, it's time to do it nigga
Nigga Come on, Nigga Come on Wodie!

Bedroom on the bench, baby, we're safe

But I want to let you play
Don't I look at you like it's a new day?

I'm only saying this to wake you up (saying) (Yes)
It's all good when we make love
All I ask is that you don't take our love
And if you don't want me
Someone else will (Tryna tells him)
Baby, never get too comfortable
(Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable)
Speaking of leaving and you're still not gone
And if you go, go right
And I'm going to send an airplane to pick up the next one
And if you go, you go your best
No husband, I don't stop
I confess to the crime scene.
Because under the covers, I'm a mess
Yes darling you are blessed
Now just don't jump your nest, come on yeah

About you, your love, your sex
You know I work for you as Bowflex

Make sure the neighbors don't rest
We can get together never disconnect
Yes your back your neck
You stay, never wrong, cara
I'm not saying this to shake you (saying) (Yes)
I'm just saying this to wake you up (saying) (I have one)
It's all good when we make love

My love for you is real (Ohh)
And if you don't want me
Someone else will (irreplaceable, huh?)
Baby no (yeah)
Ever got too comfortable
Don't get too comfortable, ayy
(Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable)
Yes, word to God, my mom is going to like it
Yes
I think everyone will like this
Carter Treys
But I, I, oh I, I have the world in my hands
I spin it on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I see you with your palms on your pants
But I, I, look at me, I have the world in my hands
I'm a heavy smoker and a little drinker
I know your name, yeah
Your name is not important, yes (haha!)
And she thinking about abortion, damn
Uhh, I woke up this morning, rock hard cock
Ashes my blunt on my Grammy award
You can save your nonsense on your memory card
He says it was sauce, I say it was jelly
Then I ran to the money like a running black
Now I think I'll have a coffee with six sugars.
In a world full of ass kissers and cock shooters
I'm trying to walk a straight line but the crooked line
I'm shooting at the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yes, I bought a whole new attitude.
Hate is music to my ears, I have my dance shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there's no answer for
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue
I see you with your palms on your pants (haha!)
I spin it on my finger (yeah) I'm a critical thinker (yeah)
I'm a heavy smoker (yeah) and a little heavy drinker (hey!)
I know your name, yeah
Your name is not important, yes
We are in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking about abortion, damn
Uhh, down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
And when life sucks, I just enjoy my head
Uh, smoking in that hallelujah, thanks Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the past.
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you have to fight the devil with a demon.
The blood is in the streets and it's up to my knees
Underground shit, I look like a seed
Living in the glass, and everyone looks
But how can you get the photo if you don't know who took it?
These current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everyone fights for positions, musical chairs
On the way to redemption, you will use some spare parts
Yeah i know your name (hey!) Yeah
Your name is not important, yes (listen mayne)
We are in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking about abortion, damn
And the red glow rockets, the bombs exploding in midair
Life is a roller coaster, but it is still unfair.
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since he's in disguise, we don't know if he's there.
And I see you with your palms on your pants
But I, I, look at me, I have the world in my hands
As is shawty
Uh! Competition is different these days
Uh ... That competition is competing for ...
My amazing fan base
And uh ... my amazing admirers

That competition is competing for my amazing fan base
My admirers

So they still say they love me
And competing for them they love and competing for them to keep fucking me
That's my competition these days and I love it
Hey Hey hey!
Because the police are looking at the streets, they are talking

Niggas ain't loyal ya, niggas ain't lawyers
And everyone saw you and she's not a bitch!
And this here is the Carter, oh! me! And this is the Carter me! Oh!

I'm gonna keep hitting this street shit in your ear
I will speak on all the streets this year
My shit beat every jeep on every street this year
Wizzle F Baby, you niggas can have the Weezy I'm the Birdman Jr. junior
And in the streets I am a man of money
And I hunt it with the streets, I get money on the streets like a hundred men
A hundred tests in my other hand
If spring ever falls like a rubber, I know what I'm saying
Because the police are looking at the streets, they are talking
Already hoes is unfaithful, your family is not great
Niggas ain't loyal ya, niggas ain't lawyers
And everyone saw you and she's not a bitch
The police are watching, the streets are talking
Hoes is unfaithful, your family is not great
Niggas ain't loyal ya, niggas ain't lawyers
Now all the bitches have me walking with my cock in hand
And these niggas rolled me with my clip on my hip
But this is my land, so the puncture doesn't stumble because K doesn't get stuck and a nigger doesn't get lost
They tell me I'm shit like a nigga, don't me
And I don't join niggas I don't love bitches just money and drugs nigga
I leave you bitches, money and drugs, nigga
Three for you wisdom five more for you mug nigga
How many more do you love nigga?
Because I have so much more to give, I have never been a spokesperson
Ask him reverend about me, I am the young God
Aim the shotgun at your frame and boy bust
Brain and guts drip down the drain and such spills
Sure yuk a fucking boy. Damn boy!
The technological heat, son of an ass, put your damn chest under your son
Blooka blook blap bleep ya ass son (laughs)
Nigga tries to see her grandson and us
Got niggas in the yard trying to see me with a Grammy
Couldn't see me even if you were standing with me
I am so damned convincing, not invisible, that man is invincible
And I let you do the time that I do the crime
When the crowd yells my name, I bring my team to the line
Nigga that's S.Q. and well nigga that's S.Q. and firrin Nigga!
Say ah! Wizzle F Baby fa ya muhfuckin black collar
KL, Fee Fee in the building in Rome, DI, Ceeti ...
I remember then, in December, it was winter like '89
And I'm not talking about speakers
I saw my dad there, I would stare at him, but I wouldn't touch him
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Shit, I just knew too much
And I learned to create it
So come see, or come eat
And I hope she is taking a ride of her life
No red lights in sight
Just a bare room with green lights
Come now
Who did you Where? Why? What do you think it was?
That's your ho
But I think you are crazier than her.
Because she is not a daisy
Shit she just ceramic
My heroes had the wide ones and the cars with big old tires
And I could remember slandering, thinking
I want to be like them
Since I was little, since I was little
When the 5-0 comes
Because i'm not stupid
And that shit I hated
Like the early 90s and the late 80s
I was rushed like a baby
You can ask Eagle Street about me
I'm a g
Because I had no sense of where I was
Walk without wit
Shit, nigga, would you be crazy
And I'm an 80's baby
Because in those streets
I'm hot like the 80s
I'm on 100, I'm burning
Please pretty please
You can call me wizzle, or you can call me Wayne, man, anyone
But it's Weezy Baby for your bitch
I said to Weezy Baby, I said more than once.
She just screams "Baby!" when she's on top of me
And the sheets stick together like pages
And the bed is so smelly
If she says it's my baby, shit, it might not be for me
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M gets the money
Dollar, dollar bill
I've been having these nightmares of wasting time, no reward
Mom would call the Lord, before calling the law.
Then I went and found time in an Audemars
Behind the money, get that rhyme report, fuck it
Uh, I didn't cut the job, droptop in the 20s
As soon as I learned to speak, I talked about business
Nigga is not safe, the 9 inputs
And for you it's just a change, I want every JC Penney
And I'm late for your funeral, rented suit
Pick up a mini skirt, get behind her like Benny
Going to your neck, grab the rope, tie a rope
I'm dirty like ENT, yell at Murphy Lee
I have to cut credit cards, plastic surgery
I am a God, have mercy on me, I am higher than Mercury
Smoking in that fort, filled with that Hercules
Waiter, hurry up, hurry up with my drink
Niggas throwing capers like they came with a rope
I'm standing on the stove with my gun in the sink
Because I don't know what blacks think, but I know how they think
Uh, grab a skateboard to the jaw
I'm in that pussy, she amazed
And this is my boy from home, Quick Draw McGraw
I'm even on both sides of the rocker
Kill you and your right hand, left-handed
Money on bitches, and above the law, money
Uh, pocket full of money, with a gang full of hitters
Porsches in black and white, like a Nazi with a black
Money makes the world, 360
We toss them dollars, bitches better be frisbees
Pounds in the freezer, 50 rounds in the sweeper
Counter full of coke, naked bitch packing
I love this shit so much, I put on a tuxedo
Man, it's been a minute since I saw my nigga Bubba
Some niggas fade, some niggas hit the bridge
Kidnap your niece, don't cry, call your uncle
We don't want to hurt you, baby, we just want your uncle
I don't hear that shit, I'm sadder than Leppard
Somewhere, anywhere, they find your body cut off
You know they find blacks guilty like they're finding treasures
But get your money sometimes, I waste too much
It is an occasion
I heard a nurse say, "Thank you for being so patient."
I know my nigga got me, we're good forever
Get the cheese nigga, please avoid the crusher
Changing from good to better, I have to fix it
I wish the blood on the floor was rose petals
Real gangsters die of old age
And old money, get paid, my nigga, Tunechi
(Introduction, Paul Wall and [Juelz Santana])
Swisha House baby
Fuck off
(Hook, Paul Wall and [Juelz Santana])
We don't give a shit
We take great weapons, front, we will explode
(Verse 1, Juelz Santana)
I'm sad and dirty with this
I'm down to get dirty, bitch
Aww man, aww damn
The pound only hurts my hip
Fuck with me
I'll show you how they hit each other and the little birds turn around
Play with clowns, they'll find you in the dirtiest ditch (Hey!)
He likes it, yeah, I don't give a shit about who (about who?)
I'm like, we don't give a shit about'chu '
Low hat in front
Lean back, smoking a little forcefully (Hey!)
See that button? Hit that, dope in the trunk
No, Coca Cola in the trunk
That gun is also on my hip, I've been waiting for you to do stunts (Yeah!)
You don't want my niggas crawling through you woooods (through ya wooods)
You don't want to see that gun in your face, friend
You don't want my niggas to go with gooooods (Gooods)
So don't play like that (No)
Don't act like that (no)
(Hook)
I have tinted windows, five percent
Presidential Limousine Dye
I can see you, but you can't see me
Two twenty three with extended clip
Those fifty shots are going to light it
Then fire drill, bitch drop and roll
Give me that watch, give me that chain
Empty your pockets and pay the toll.
I hang out with Killas on probation
Evacuate, murder for hire
Kind of like Omar on the wire
We will chop you like garlic cloves
And cook your butt, like Elmer the chef
Take your last breath, put on your vest
But I'm aiming for a boss, not a chest
Now pack the iron, I'll start to die
That will throw a knob and take me apart
And when you wake up in the morning
To the sound of helicopters roaring
We will leave your whole family in mourning
I'm in the neighborhood like wig shops
I'm on the routine, on the block
Posted as Yao Ming
We will cut you like a screw tape
And have you screaming like the Opera
But with my side kick coming out
I'm not talking about any T-Mobile partna
(Hook)
That girl has you too excited
That money had you too excited
Those cars made you leave your character
That jewelry got you out of your character
The girls got you out of your character
This fame took you out of character
I showed you love now you're out of place
I should have known you would cross me
I should have known you would cross me
I should have known
Because I'm on and I'm shameless
And I left and you salty
Steam coming out of your head like coffee
My reality is better than your dreams nigga
My ho pussy is wetter than your dreams nigga
Put your head in the microwave, DING! nigga
You're out of place, slime, you're out of place
And I am without patience, sick and tired like malaria
These hoes like mosquitoes
Know where the cup in
I'm working on my return
The girl I'm with has a lot of class
But she has a silly ass
I keep a bag of money, a bag of drugs and a bag of weapons
These niggas don't even shine, making the sun mad
Rappers in my lunch bag
Bedroom full of new dykes
Old green and new white
That's old money, that's new coke
That's Young Money, that's 24/7, 3-6-5
That is cash; I'm like "who?" Who who?
I should have known you would cross me (I'm in my yard)
I should have known you would cross me
(Thinking of Hollygrove)
I should have known you would cross me
I should have known you would cross me (I say goodbye)
I was looking into your eyes, you're not made like that
You're not built like this (I should have known)
I should have known you would cross me
I should have known you would cross me
I am with the thieves, the murderers and the kidnappers.
Still fuck a bitch, fuck the ring, fuck a shepherd
I have this money and I will not reject
This money will change your life but it will bring down your family
Cause some of the niggas closest to me, I'll kill them
For real
I should have known you would cross me
I'm from the neighborhood, that's where they taught me
Go hard until they get away from me
I should have known you would cross me
I should have known you would cross me
I should have known you would cross me
I should have known you would cross me
I should have known you would cross me
I should have known you would cross me
I should have known you would cross me
I got some niggas that were there
That is no longer there
I do not care
I should have known you would cross me
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
Rest in peace Lil Naughty
Fuck you bitches, coppers
Yes you're laughing
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
This is a real man
Hard but hard
Are you sure you can't bear the weight
Mommy had to hurry because my pop was happy
Mom had 1 son 2 jobs
What a woman Come from where women have to work as men
So we don't need dad, we have money like him
No school clothes, no support
And next year I'll probably be in a Robb report
I am important, so is my clique, I go for them
God do not take us to dividing waters
Guide my daughter to see that she walks straight
Live positive, stay away from broken snitches, enemies and niggas with your face hanging
Everyone is ready for when that day comes
I hid two million until that case came, just look at me to a hype
So if you feel me get blunt in the air
And light one and don't cry
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
Pass me the grass, take it to your head
I hope the smoke turns my eyes red, my eyes red because
And if you see a tear that doesn't mean I'm scared baby, I'm just a man
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
Pass me the grass, take it to your head
I hope the smoke turns my eyes red, my eyes red because
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
I'm in the routine like all the time
I have money but murder doesn't cost a penny
All kinds and types of car jewelry clothing.
I look like a porcupine
But I'm so brilliant that I keep walking
Keep barking, hate, yeah, you talk a lot, but I'm on top and I'm not talking bad
Man they act like they don't know I'm from Apple & Eagle
But the eagle will destroy your apple
So I'll let it rock
Until they let Bubba out of the cell block
And light the grass
Fix your G and don't cry!
Pass me the grass, take it to your head
I hope the smoke turns my eyes red, my eyes red because
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
And if you see a tear that doesn't mean I'm afraid, baby, I'm just a man and
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
I remember the look on your face, mom, when the doctors told you I did it, your son will be fine, he did it
Then I remembered that they went in there and asked me if I wanted to see you
I told them no
I was just scared
This is crazy shit
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
I was shot when I was 12
I shoot again at 20, will I shake up these old dreams?
Lord, wake me up with holy water on my face and 3 drops of dried blood on the side of my eyes
Why do we have to kill our own when we get up?
Now I have to go down the stairs when I go up
And they don't want to drive
They want to learn how to work the tool.
And who am I not to do my duty?
Just think if the pop tips are sent from black ink
And that sucks, but man, that's real
And in the hood, even steaks stink on the grill
I remember when if you were a scammer, you were a winner
Now that's like raking leaves in winter
And that's not even cool to miss a few summers
I'm going to bite the onion like
Fuck it!
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
And i won't cry
(Hook)
I hope the smoke turns my eyes red, my eyes red because
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
Pass me the grass, take it to your head
I hope the smoke turns my eyes red, my eyes red because
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
And the direct vodka is the potion, it makes me spill my emotion and
Keep on coming with that gangsta music, young Weezy has that mother fucking gangsta music
So ride on you and vibrate on you
Hello and
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
Keep on coming with that gangsta music, young Weezy has that mother fucking gangsta music
So ride on you and vibrate on you
Hears
Speak real, real rap here for you
Uh huh
Young Maine rapping with me
Lil Bootie Bitch Getter
Yes sir
(ME,)
Young Mal, Young Capo Young Tanz on the back
Already!
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
You already know
Birdman I see you
You already know that your son has this
(I, I, I, I don't want you to see me cry)
Yeah that shit almost made me cry
Go to the next song
Yes Yes
yes
Ima call this here ... real rap
And I hope you know that you will never live to die
I grew up where people called them people about us
I think we slandered, but we just got beeps
Grindin 'all day like we had sleep insomnia
Living as the videos write a treatment about us
Trapped in the hood like they put cement on us
The ghetto birds still shit on us, the government still leaves us
So we have the names written on us
Whites still spit on us
But we smoke, the ashes still come to us
The older bitches still beat us
Beezy is not here ... where is Beezy? ... Beezy was killed
And that was my nigga, come back with my nigga
But I know that's how my nigga happened
Shit is so much deeper than this rappin 'my nigga
So I'm going to play the captain, the sailing ship flutters my nigga
No pretend I'm happy happy for my nigga Lil 'Tiggas
The last time we saw him was when Katrina hated
Found her body like a month later, rest in peace boy
He was a good nigga so I know he blessed
And her daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But I'm going to go ahead, and I swear I have a lump in my throat
But I'm going to keep pumping the flow
My nigga Lil 'Derrick rushes to copy a key
Either that, or load the gat and pop a G
And that's why it's just a name in a song of mine
I pray for his family and his mom well
I think about it all the time
I drink about it all the time
Because if my thoughts caught me, I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in a can, thank God I had dreams of being the man
Yes
Because he's not shit for a man on the edge
The five or naughty dead good dead boy
Shot face down on the grass
Not to mention with their handcuffs on
Not to mention they had simple clothes
But no one does anything about it
The jail and morgue are too crowded
And hates all time
Everyone has to hate, it's like a damn iPod
Shit and they tried to burn my ghost
But I got my gun license, I got my hammers
I'm ready to shoot like a camera
Stand still mothafucka I'm going to have to write my will this summer
Because if they don't kill me, I'm going to kill this summer
Yes
And you can put that on my late father
Or my grandfather Larry Bosock
And all I know about my real blows is that I had money
No bank account, that brown paper bag
Yeah he could hit me with a little money to brag
But that's why when I see it, I act insanely funny.
Because he is a joke to me
Don't send messages, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mom how it's supposed to be
And I make sure you paid as if you had written for me
And I know that she has all the hope for me
And I never want to see her depressed for me
Hopefully, but honestly there is a day for me
But we went to pray, it's as far as the future sees
Amen
I know that all over the world I will get to money
She's crazy about cock and I'm addicted to money
It's a dirty world and my cup too, it's so muddy
Long story short, I'll get to the money
My lady talking crazy, I heard the money
She's crazy about this dick and I'm addicted to money
I have to see that bitch, she must be there for the money
Long story short, I'm a pimp before a doll
If I don't get my check, I'm going to be checking my chin for nothing
If I don't get my check, I'll be checking my chin in public
Long story short, I'm only getting to the money
Long story short, I'll keep it short and sweet
I get to the money, I don't let it affect me
She will thank you for coming
You put that money in the dresser for her
You take the bitch out to restaurants
And I took the bitch straight to the damn mall
I get higher than cholesterol
I see money in my crystal ball
I see money in my crystal ball
Ringtone 2Pac, Soulja Slim or Biggie Smalls
Counting money, listening to 2Pac, Soulja Slim or Biggie Smalls
I have Steph walking around the house
I don't mean no home
I don't need a house
But the niggas spread their hands and I don't read palms
I know these niggas are pussy
I know these niggas are pussy
I know these niggas are looking
I know these niggas are paying attention
I know these bitches have bad intentions
But I just want my money
I just want my money
I got them
I'm starting to feel like pulling
Try to break me, you better break me some money
Speaking of which you love me? Better show me with the money
Show up at my door? Better appear with the money
Take me somewhere nice? It better be private and sunny
I have what you want, you have what I need
I just take the check and let you take the initiative
Put a dollar sign at the beginning of Stephanie
Mule
I see money in my crystal ball
I'm about to burst this crystal ball
How about nigga?
Ringtone 2Pac, Soulja Slim or Biggie Smalls
Counting money, listening to 2Pac, Soulja Slim or Biggie Smalls
I have things walking around the house
And I'm a dog and I'm in my drawers
I mean, can I dance?
I don't mean not home
I don't need a house
Spending spaniel, wasted 'cause my nigga rushes for me
I'm mad at my girls and we're showing up for nothing
So close to all my brothers and so far from the ugly
Racin 'in my new car, I see new friends acting funny
Spending spaniel, wasted 'cause my nigga rushes for me
Broke my heart? I break the boy from the bank, I'm Young Money
All these niggas around me are my brothers, they are my brothers
They will kill anyone if they fuck with me, I love them
They will kill anyone if they fuck with me, I love them
All these niggas around me are my brothers
Broke my heart? I break the boy from the bank, I'm Young Money
Long story short, I'll get to the money
Long story short, I'll get to the money
Long story short, I'll get to the money
Long story short, I'll get to the money
I will get to the money
Desperado young man, straight from the grotto
I'm so bad, my shadow chooses not to follow
Little nigga but look at me like a fucking rhino
Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano
It's a drought, right? How the hell would I know?
Nigga, I've been getting my share as Sonny Bono
I ran through the streets ... look at my biography
I started high with two O's like Ohio
I'm fucking crazy; cashews
I skate away, like "Later guys"
Never catch me, baby, I'm smooth mashed potatoes
And just when it stopped, I made it move
Respect me nigga I'm a dog; no asian food
And Daisy Dukes, bitch, nigga
And we gotta get into gangsta shit
My nigga ... keep talking that shit you're talking about
And we gotta get into gangsta shit
My nigga ... 'Cause you're not even really over all that
You're not even over all that
And don't forget ... I know you, you're not above all that
Niggas must want Joey to lean on them
Flash the binky, splash your dreams on them
Leave the murder game back to Hustlin's packs
Yes, Weezy Homie supports you, be they raps or macks
Either way, they both spit like BRRRRAT!
Nigga ... they muhfuckas break like dykes
And we already sold so much drugs, it's not shit, tell me
My shit will make you run naked like old school
And yes, we fight it, and you're not saving me
Unless you have a whole bloody suicide army
And I'm a friend rider, and you can find it in me
That 40 cal will make you iron the photo of your shirt
This shit is funny to me
I had them like little niggas, I raised them around real niggas
Poppin 'bottles fucking them nigga bitches
I made money up to the ceiling, my young nigga got cold
I changed all my new black shoes, got some new tools
And nothing has changed, keep doing the same
Still making money, still spending change
We are rushed from Sunday to Sunday
And we are grinding every day as if the money did not come
I have the drug in the Hummer case for that thing
I hate the law for what they did broke in niggas cribs
I wish I had caught them Idda split them fucking wig
3rd Ward, let me claim my fame
I left it, Uptown, I'm going to do what I think
I'm not nervous
I swear to God I'm not nervous, no, no
And I'm laughing at them niggas pussy
My black Drake he jewish
I swear to God I'm not nervous, no haha
Ok i swear to god i'm not nervous
I swear to God I'm not nervous
I say, I swear to God I'm not nervous
I have no problem with this bitch, by the way
I see you appear but your appearance does not work
I just want some mouth and lip service
And I got all my niggas on that truck like a tour
Okay, I'm straight at you, no rebound
That boned pussy, that's Chick-fil-a
I fuck real riders and they get paid
For them dead presidents, we will start digging graves
They say the best things in life are free
And my pants fall like shit - I'm still in my business
I spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions
I saw my enemy in the light, shot him before he turned green
Well, my niggas gave them birds, you don't even have bird seeds
Your bitch rides me like a kart, I play that pussy like Mozart
I Mozart these hoes hearts then after they are worth nothing
I said I swear to God I'm not nervous
I don't know, I swear to God I'm not nervous
And that pussy is not bought, ho
I have no problems with this bitch by the way
I see that you appear but your appearance does not work
I like those with long hair and curves
I will leave the brain in their jerseys
She says she loves me, that's the molly talking
I'm the original gangster, he's the remix
Girl, do you use that same mouth to kiss you mom?
I mean, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday outfit is her pajamas.
She says, I didn't know your cock was a recliner
I'll hit your man in his eye, give him a shine
I'll blind him and whoever signs it
I have Adam as Yolonda
Young money Cash, Obama
Fuck the world, there's no condom
And this gun came with a silence.
And I swear to God I'm not nervous, no
I swear to God I'm not nervous, uh-uh
Bitch, I'm the God, I should rap in a turban
I see you appear but your appearance does not work
Baby I just want a little mouth and lip
In that Pat-ron, I'm wandering, I play tight like virgins
You see the niggas I'm with, that boy Boo the shit
As long as I have a face, your bitch has a place to sit
Yeah i'm going crazy about them
All my girls will be bougie
I don't speak, let's do it
Real niggas winning, fake niggas losing
Bitch I'll leave that pussy bruised
No you know i swear to god i'm not nervous
I got it working, twerkin and sipping, my snake
I have no problem with this bitch and that's for sure
I'm putting my head behind Maybach's curtains
Already
Cut like a blender, chopper like thick
They got so many pussy nigggas, they started watching me
I don't give a shit if you're in the cut
With the helicopters, so sign up, have lunch
Shooting out the window saying Young Money motherfucker
You niggas know sugar shit
You niggas know bullit kisses
See me at the Bentley, with a rolled-up window
You know a boss, I'm a booker
A bitch gets lost if I take her
To the second-hand show where I live, like, look here
I have a cave mansion, like Batman
And your girlish pussy explodes at the handstand
You want to flex behind him, you're a bad man
Young Money, strong fun, age like bam bam
Black Lamb on the interstate, the coppers screaming, I bet I could escape
Spitta!
They got so many pussy nigggas, they started watching me
I don't give a shit if you're in the cut
With the helicopters, so sign up, have lunch
I am sitting in the Chevy Shavell
With my favorite girl, she looks at Dave Chapell
While I am in the soul, about to light an L
Talking to one of my friends, who is caged in jail
Tell me about this nigga who grew up in hell
Word got out that I called the blame on his girl, now call like it's the end of the world
Now I have to put him in his world, near daten, near Satan
That's when you go when I see you, I'm glad it's me because, bitch, I don't want to be you
As Homer said, the Greek homicides, I did it
What is, rescue, parents, handsome
Look Big said niggas bleed like us
But you never knew it, niggas are cheese, like us
Cut like a blender, chopper like thick
They got so many pussy nigggas, they started watching me
With the helicopters, so sign up, have lunch
Shooting out the window saying Young Money motherfucker
Skinny nigga, fat pockets
What you know about the fat profit
Because I have that bitch, in my back pocket
I went straight to the forest, I missed college
Yes, you know, Mack and I blew up the streets.
Young B, with 2 balloons
Make a nigga see double, one shot
Rocks in my chain, like Barney Rubble
This is not an axadent, I was born to rush
Cut like a blender, chopper like thick
They got so many pussy nigggas, they started watching me
I don't give a shit if you're in the cut
With the helicopters, so sign up, have lunch
Shooting out the window saying Young Money motherfucker
Damn (Damn, girl)
You know you're having it
You can see by the way that she walks
Well i could be your bobby
Or your only tendaroni
Let me transport you like Scotty
Everyone at this girlll party
Give, give, give, give, give, give, give
Give, give, give, give, give, yeah
Give, give, give, give, give, give, give
Give, give, give, give, give
Yes i know you love me
Yeah give me that monkey
Yeah that funky monkey
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
You know you know
You know you know
I'm on flint, Benjamin Franklin, my twin
Yeah if she can't swim I got a girl sinking in my benz
Back blow, back, like Michael Phelps with my back
Break her until her back breaks, I leave her numb like crack
Isn't it sweet like Honey Dew honey?
Menage A, look Honey make Honey and then they make me and I'm glad they did
Yes, I am wit D-R-E
We're so fucking cooler than you (than you)
Give, give, give, give, give, give, give
Give, give, give, give, give, give, give
Low
Damn (Damn, girl)
Hey you know you got it going
You can see by the way that she walks
You are so good that your body needs a bodyguard
But I'm your Kevin Costner
And I'll be the boss, girl
I'll lift a bicycle, because Shawty can't be seen
And I just want to see her
Give, give, give, give, give, give, give
Give, give, give, give, give, yeah
Give, give, give, give, give, give, give
Give, give, give, give, give
No lines, no laughs, just wine and grass.
And sometimes they can be lying on the grass
What do you know about being swallowed coke and then put it in my ass?
I'm nasty huh? But she likes that shit
So I like that trick but never bitch's wife, no
But no matter that bitch, I got so much more
Hen 'and Mo', women know ... Weezy Deuce Bigalow
So say hello to the crew
The game comes with the boy, the boy comes with the game bitch I'm a Game Boy
She from the other side of the club, I have a boy of rank
DJ let her know that I came and she came
White as the cane in the range, drop and drop in the thangs like stop, explode, cut and slang
Fi, he told me to milk him, I did it and he said I killed him, so now we're both dirty, brother, do you have to feel me?
And brother, you gotta kill me if you want me to stop punching this real shit in your ears, bitch
And here is this new thang, SQ Wayne, SQ Gang
Running away from the scene, Hammer in my jeans
I bustle all night tell my bitch I'll never come home
Be there in the morning, stop crying bitch
The sun is at home, let it fall on the living room table
Leave the money at home, I know you won't stay once the money runs out
So while I'm rich, I take out my dick and put on my fucking
Youngin 'on a real "Gangsta Gangsta" shit
It is the fault of the neighborhood in which I was sanctioned
But I will make sure we have acres
Tell them to fuck the computers, we are fine with the paper
Tell them to screw the world because I'm a bell by nature
Feeling this is how the hood will make you
The hood is empty, the streets are empty, yeah
Mr. Bush, rebuild the city, but
Yes, like yesterday floating to the floodgates
This is New Orleans, welcome to the blood state.
A bloodbath, and you're nothing but a bait for the bathtub
There is no political justice, not even the judge safe
If his butt can't swim he has a case closed
We need our own space, I'm not talking about Jupiter
I'm a hoosier, usually the cool one
But when I need it, I become a looter
God forgives, but does He forgive the brutals?
Even when it's for the best of your junior
You'll soon see that life is just another movie
There's nothing that hasn't been done that you can do to me
They hit me, they shot me, a black man shot me!
Yes, money in the mind, murder in the plans.
Disturb if you can, but it's dinner for the family
Hurry when you can, don't tell me anything, I'm a man
I was shot twice, here to put it in a rhyme
Slow lane, move the Coupe like a 5
And I know my niggas love me, but they can't do my thing
Get lost or stand in line
But the carpet is still fine.
So keep trying, everyone will come back
But we keep trying until we get our piece, no piece
Follow Firin '
Bah
Dark shadows, I can't see your enemies
Now eat these fucking bullets, don't forget to tip the waiter
I don't drink champagne, my stomach hurts

My weapons are completely black, make me take out the blacks
Also, I realized that, finger fuck, Nina
She horny, you won't see it tomorrow morning (Nigga)
We're fucking cold, young money, old money

Bitch I'm in that pattern fuck me bad and kill me
I have a silencer on the gun, that bitch goes "pu"
I have a silencer on the gun, that bitch goes "pu"
Hustler, caller
Kill them all, keep banking
Large mansions on the island
Taking shots from the bottle
Hunting while we atrophy (Bitch), rich trigger hood
Turn the water into wine, hit your set and paint that bitch
O-O-Out the Bentley with them pigeons, hidden for the plug
Green and red background, throwing hundreds in the club
Bragging on the shine, we niggas running shit
Blood to bloodline, pearl white, black tints
Main light, red light, spend them on green light
Flashlight, fast life, hit them for cheap price
Bragging life, living the way we lived twice
Aim blank (nigga), give it shit for the price
Dark shadows, I can't see your enemies
Now eat these fucking bullets, don't forget to tip the waiter
I don't drink champagne, my stomach hurts
I have a silencer on the gun, that bitch goes "pu"
I have a silencer on the gun, that bitch goes "pu"

Got-Got a disgusting swagga, my bitches too
Rest in peace Magnolia Shorty
I get stupid, I delay
The grass is greener in my garden.
More arrogant than the warden
Pow Pow Pow I'm not arguing ha
Leave a nigga dripping
I have a silencer on the gun but the bullets still speak
I got a fit of buncha bitches
To tell me all your secrets
I'm on your walls like graffiti
You're dead of pita bread, you're a fed nigga
I'm in my vampire, bloody black black flag
Fucking with Lil Tunechi get your head broken, nigga
I hit you on the money, call that dead cash nigga
And it's, excellent waynes world party time
World Waynes Excellent Party Time
Tonight I'm probably fucking another black girl
World Waynes Excellent Party Time

Dark side, dark side, dark side
Dark side, dark side, dark side
We don't like these niggas, we don't fight these niggas
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Shoot him shut up shut up
Eat it, dick down, snuggle up
Lick, lick, done enough
Eat it, spit it out, gum
Treat her well, treat her, problems come
I have some cocaine and a couple of blunts
.44 plastic, rubber bust
I have the Holy Ghost in my Backwood
On tiptoe and flat feet
Pigeon bitch and her cat well
I know her pussy hole like my MacBook
Ella Tootsie-Roll on black wood
Get your own page in the black book
And she starts to feel like I'm attached to her
If it's that good, I put a stamp on it
Double-edged sword and a bubble, boy
I just won a war in a Hummer 'before I'm going to come to yours
Looking for a war, I'm nothing but something else
That much more than the blow poured
And I slip more with aching lungs
I smoke you and your blunt blows
Let's get on with it, Megatron with it
Telephone as a telethon
Bitches work bitches like a platoon
Finish dizzy yellow bones, very long visits
And I'm talking about numbers, digits of Jerry Jones
I'm at home drinking, and I've been drinking
I have a Draco with my arm inside
Shoot you in your heart, put some charm on it
I'm sorry I have to leave your mother tormented
"Bah, bah, bah" if you comment
I'm not done, I hope you are out of breath
Long-life money with a strong finish
Presidents dead, I was not born with that, I will die with that
I'm in love with it, I didn't start living until the war ended
It's war time, war time, war time
You all little niggas little time
All my ex-cons niggas
And we don't screw with all of you kind
Bitch, it's wartime, wartime, wartime
All my niggas ran out of time
Or make time, that's just wasted time
Dark side, dark side, dark side
So we run until the car dies
Bitch, it's wartime (wartime), wartime (wartime)
Wartime (wartime), no talk time (no talk time)
Chalk time (Chalk time), all-time (All-time), hard time (Hard-time)
Bitch bitch
Dark side (dark side), dark side (dark side), dark side (dark side)
(Dark side, dark side, dark side, bitch)
As I erase the stars from the windows of my spaceship
Call the spirits in my basement
Crawl through the center of the snake pit
And fall in the midst of its greatness
Not impressed with flames or flickers.
But take her for a walk on the moon, she wears her slippers
The sky is falling, I'm falling for her faster
We hide in the clouds, then we forgive the riddle
High above the ground but I'm under his charisma
Its sound is enveloping when I am in your solar system.
Silence calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsing
The planet of sorrows, and she is my recipe.
We're out of this world, darling, we've been evicted
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, intergalactic, intergalactic love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you get there before me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yes, yes, yes, yes)
Open the curtains
Watching windows, people killing, stealing
The sky is falling, falling
I become news, and this is the apocalypse
People living on their rockets
My mom always told me this shouldn't stop
Fireball reflections on friends and photos from my room.
From me and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
See you on the moon?
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, falling
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
I will be waiting, I will be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you get there before me
On the dark side of the moon (Yes, yes, yes, yes)
I said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, intergalactic, intergalactic love
And I'll be waiting for you (for you, for you)
On the dark side of the moon
I said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
Leather intestines
With a top model
And the contestants
I'm a rottweiler
Yes i'm a rock and roll
It's Weezy Fuckin 'Baby
Yes, directly in the stroller
Chrome in the monster
Leather intestines
With a top model
And the contestants
I'm a rottweiler
Yes i'm a rock and roll
It's Weezy Fuckin 'Baby
Yes, directly in the stroller
Marley twists them
I'm like macaulay culkin
He was rich when he was pissing
You niggas haterholics
I'm just the recipe
So you can save the garlic
I'm like a set of keys
I'm about to start
I smoke them Beverly
Hills, California
So I put that palette on them
And he said I should put a saddle on him
I take care of them snakes
Listen to that rattle, friend
And I don't have a clique
I have a cattle, friend
How about five
Backing away just being a boo
I'm talking about foreign money
Like a European type
Yes I'm heavy man
Then you should reconsider
I hit you once
I have rhythm
I travel all over the world like a postcard
My cold flow
Fuck and have a cold sore
I've got this bitch in the lock like a closed door
Weezy is real, they other niggas folklore
I'm online, I have more hoods than a coat store
I have success, I have more shit than you can expect
And I ran through that water like a rowboat
Young, Carter's name
Baby boy coming up like hot water and 'Caine
Whip, stretch and flip
Re-up
We are in the club, we are in the club
Money running like water, bitch get up in the tub
I'm in the club, she's in the club, he's in the club
Now she can't go, so we fuck at the club
Am I lucky or what?
Playboy rabbit
And I like big languages, like skate fashion
I have more girls than the Playboy mansion
And a black drink like the late Fred Sandford
And a nigga smokes like there's no cancer
And I know this world is so cold and deceiving
Yes, and until that chosen night
I'm going to be yelling Apple and Eagle
Yes, it is true, Apple and Eagle
No, and this is just the preview
But I'm already working on the sequel
Fuck me wrong
I'll fuck with your house
Like a letter to the wife saying your husband left
But as a Muslim I am going to bomb
And beat the track like a hundred arms
I'm funky like armpits
Then the alarms go off
Tha Carter 2 was nice
Weezy fuckin '
Now we return it to its regular scheduled schedule
I'm about to kick the whole Young Money family out right now
Let's do this shit, my black Mac Maine for president
G-series on the streets right now
Hit a nigga on MySpace or something
(Sample)
Day dreaming
I fell asleep under the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Day dreaming!
You already know
What the hell is he exploiting?
Baby, I'm what jumps
I keep a Zip-Lock bag full of 'Dro
And I keep a bad bitch down with me
I will be a G until the day I leave
I can feel it in the air
The reaper comes slow
Shhh ...
I can hear the reaper coming
But I'm not afraid, oh, no, no, I'm not running
The angels on my shoulders are using me for a battle
Spiritual warfare, good against evil
I even fought demons like semen
Yes, they took me there, damn from my day of birth.
I have a heaven-sent flow though it's hell on earth
So with that in mind I don't live for Prada
I am trying to stack and mack, and I have stigmas
Try to get the same fan base as Big Poppa
Sometimes when I flow, they say South Big appeared.
But I'm from Holly Grove, I can't give up on the lock (Holly Grove)
You already know
(Bring it home mang)
You can see me on the side of the road
(Who knew this nigger could sing?)
I asked the Lord to be my coat and my umbrella
Because it's raining cold outside
It is very cold
It is very cold (America)
It is very cold
I say, miss America, land of the free
Then you turn that acrid half I had into a pool
You get up on the news, lying about how the tax was broken
Now Weezy lost 2 Jags, and spitta's Chevy broke
You took everything we had, Uncle Sam, Satan fanatic
Mule! Yes look
I'll tell you all this last time, don't get involved
Knock your baby mom and the door of the house
We are doing home visits, I am an outlaw, in the south room
Hit your butt if you talk stupid
I have a big dick, so I walk stupid
Wait, bad hoes need a raise, lame niggas try to escape
But all diamonds need to be evaluated, you on the way
Too many nights I lurked, mind bewildered, today
I'm on ocean drive with a bad bitch lying in the shadows
Drinking Minute Maid, I have to penetrate, let me show you
I have a forest with the wet
Go to Blake Griffin, I could flex them
That's too much sauce, I bet they know who I am
They treat a nigger like a superstar and that's who I am
I have your bitch but that's my bitch
So that's our bitch and that's great
When you go on a trip, you want to dive, she just calls me and I fall
And that's bad news, hold these nuts, cashews
Vroom, I flew by, new whips here, what the bags do
Great past, young Jones
My enemies should have a good breakfast and a cup of coffee.
I know refugees who don't rush things, they kill them gently
My closet still has Nike boxes and a couple of corpses
Look, although I will never sell my soul, I received a couple of offers
Don't think about it, I smoke, I drink about it
They wrap the body, then they rap about it
Sink the body, then sing about it, close the body, and then drink
Fuck the world, I'm still gonna get some cool stuff out
If a CEO wants to dance everything in my videos, I need a big deposit
Swerve, divert, I'm back on them
My bad, I turn my back on them
Real shit, I've seen good girls go to airports with that package
Trill shit, I've seen bad bitches with good genes but I loosen them
I'm not focused there Gotham City I have Batmans and Jokers there
So I had to "abracadabra", "voila", just to make hope appear
Young!
Rat-ta-ta-ta, then we disappeared, right after it happened
You don't believe in magic, but you know I'm real
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mule! Voila!
I said to mom, nanny, I'm doing my bill
Voila! Voila! Ta-da! Ta-da! Voila! Voila! Mule! Voila!
Mom, nanny, I'm doing my check
Don't ruin my account, I bust two, and I'm out, voila!
Magic powder yeah that's rush
It made her laugh out loud, crying suddenly, man, that was fun
Satanic like Skeletor, you are greener than a salad bar.
I'm going from here to Africa to read something about Maya Angelou
Impractical, you are acting all DiCaprio; we catch and we go to the pot
That magic snow, it's always cold and my monster in that molly water
I met this bitch in Collins, but she left the neighborhood, her mom cook
I'm on the way, I'm on a stage, the Magic show, I feel like Dave
I come out of nowhere, bop-bop on your doorbell
Disappears in midair, all we leave is smoke there
Smoking roadkill, she in coke here
Stash is sticking to his nose
I'm a magician at the motel, moving tricks wholesale
Rat-ta-ta-ta about the talk, we got more ammo than grammar
Hammers and hammers, pull up at Lambos
Shoot the cameras, die in your pajamas
I find you with Sam and your wife and your moms
Everyone in your family, I'm playing like Magic, voila!
Abracadabra, abracadabra!
Rat-ta-ta-ta, then we disappeared, right after it happened
You don't believe in magic, but you know I'm real
Don't ruin my account, pop two and I'm leaving
Voila! Abracadabra, abracadabra!
Rat-ta-ta-ta, then we disappeared, right after it happened
Copperfield, I just broke a seal
You don't believe in magic, but you know I'm too real
Voila! Voila! OVO shorts, high socks
Wait time, na-na, I have sauce, you dried up
I'm a big boss, big mouth, magic show, don't miss it, voila!
What haven't I done yet?
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers
Blacks try to bite my style, but my style is a jalapeño
I have tight jeans, trucks in my pocket
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip
You know all my bitches are badder, and all my swishas are fatter
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word as Scrabble
She swallows so many nuts, you fuck, you find a squirrel in her throat
I'm going to carve worms into that ho, I let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they shine
I'm the best from wet pussy, in my private jet with my chef cooking
So big I twisted my neck, my niggas disgust when the referee looks
Deez crazy, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like candy canes
Lil tunechi
Could you book me for a show
Load my butt to a minimum and collect all the dough
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class photos
I like math, all I did was add bitches
Swagga galore, put your girl on all fours
It's not doggystyle, I call it froggystyle
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Saltwater pool, can I put a shark on it
All authentic, plus I called my guns
Last name "Fuck", first name "I don't give A"
Pockets look pregnant, about to give birth
So when I start pimpin ', you know the procedure
I tickle her pussy, I have that pink tickle pussy
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat
And if that pussy is sweet, I want that sweet, trick or treat
I have diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious
I'm so fucking hot that sssssss ... I need more S
Who wants another bitch, and I don't hug me bitch
I hit her with the shovel's cock, I got into the pussy and dug a ditch
Some people have to hit the clock, man, I'd rather hit a brick
Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold that I shuddered
These niggas think they're tough, these niggas just nipples
I appear a nigga like a 'sicle, I drop a nigga like a missile
More money problems, I measure you and then I wedge you
Tunechi
I got hot Spitta Spitta in the building with my mane
Who ever thought that he would be relaxing with my hair
And since he makes millions with my hair
The police try to stop but they cannot
So fuck it, nigga and fuck it
I threw vicious bitch I'm from Hollygrove
Who is Weezy F. Baby
Please, darling, please say baby
Please say baby
I'm a Hollygrove nigga, got 17 on me
Pussy ass niggas get the 17 out of me
Prolly jumping off a mountain
Rotating the gun and hitting the skeleton in your mouth and
Southern man, outstanding flow
Bada-bam-bing hoe
Weezy does his hoe
Checking in at the Four Seasons must have a good hoe
Mom a freaknik like 1993
And since she's probably the wife you sleep with
I think I don't feel like fucking but I could make you sweet lips
I'm running through my candy box. I need a little more complexion.
The gangstas, the hood, the fallen soldiers.
To the chicks that keep him in the slums
Do you smell that
Big shouts to Hollygrove
I can't forget Magnolia projects
Young baby mule
Money on my mind
(What the fuck) thought a black man?
Not even grateful
I walked over to him and put the gun to his tank
Weak nigga pussy
Where I'm from we see a damn corpse every day [x3]
Hammer in the draws
Hammer in drawers
And you'll be nothing more than nails on the wall
Posters, covers
Empty as a muthafucka
Hehe, ok, I'm just an insect lover
It's Fly Carter, Duckin the Fly Swatter
I'm just a muhfucka
Pimpin 'not dead, cause I'm pimpin' like a muhfucka
Where are you now?
Wipe your feet on the door mat
I am a suit, there is no return
I like to go backless
I'm going forward, the top can go down, the hoes will cut
Like a sword I know
You don't have to tell me
You niggas pussy eating peanut butter and jellies
Ya 'like angels
But you can find me in Ellis' white tan
Just like van halen
I'm a rock bitch
I'm a garment that Glock like a fucking outfit
You are nothing about this
Ok i'm tied
I am tied, the center of many acts, straight jackets are not tied
And scrappin we could do, see scrappin what we do
And I would like to leave myself in them! Call me Scrappy Doo
Dangerous to shoot with you I don't look stupid
You hit me? Too bad, bitch, I'll be back shooting!
Fool, I'm a fool, I do what I do
Tha Tech or Uz, Mac or Rug
I catch you when it's just you, you're like "it wasn't just you!"
I guess I'm too real for blacks to fit
Fuck me Naw bends over the nigga, fuck you
Move, lose, move an inch and more ligaments you could lose
I'll put you on the 10 o'clock news
One two fasten your shoes
Here comes the boy who
Ooo gloves Uz will fill your old wounds
Guys use more tools than Tim from Home Improve
Then I play it cool, smooth like James Brown's shoes
Don't play with him because he shoots, he will shoot
I'm loose as a goose in that goose with its hoes
I'm playing duck, duck, goose, boy, I'm cunning like the mouse
I'm not a coincidence, I'm a murderer, fuck you!
Put the blacks in silence like
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
We run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
We run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Dear Anne, my number one fan
With my pen in my right hand and that's also my microphone hand
Codeine in a Sprite can, ink on the white pad
And I'm thinking about life, Anne, and what's wrong and right, Anne
And sometimes I'm right and sometimes I could
I can't find the light yet my rhymes are brilliant
So I continue my plan and I am safe as white sand
Who will pay the price before my flight lands
I adore so I can no longer ignore what I want
So I'm just going, you can call me the assistant
And oh yes, I have a girl, she acts like I owe her
And uhm, sometimes I don't seem to know her
But I really hope I don't start to bore you, page one
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
We run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
We run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Dear Anne, my number one fan
I hope everyone is good, I hope everyone is praying
I wait wait baby let me change hands
Look, lately I've been dealing with a lot of shit, Anne
It's burning me and I can't get out of this pan
And every time I look there is a problem with this man
But your support held me up as supports
And I'm also being more careful in how I choose friends
But on another note, this is not just another note
And I just hope you read this far, page two
We run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
We run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Dear Anne, my number one fan
By now you probably think I'm portraying who I say
And it is people like you that make me proud of who I am.
Hey, you're the shit, damn, excuse the gram
And shit, when my life is like some kind of exam
It is a jungle, lions, horses and rams.
Shit, while I sit and wait for the war to start
I only think of you and then I'm rewarded again, Anne
So with you is where a part of me is, Anne
I hope to see you in the stands, Anne
Because you know I understand, Anne
And I'm sorry for Stan
So I wrote this to say I'm your number one fan
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
We run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Out of sight, out of mind, out of time to decide
We run? Should I hide for the rest of my life?
Living that life, living that life
But it's not bright enough to show me where I'm going
Try it and your family does not sleep well
I didn't think I was strong enough to do it alone
But I could overcome anything if I managed to overcome the storm, and umm
I'm killing that night, killing that night
Life on that east side
Chrome leather, television with telephone.
And the top is gone
I do it so well, I do it so well
They want it to be like
I'm in the zone, bad for my bones
Times are hard as they are
And all I want to do is run my business
And all I try to do is what I did, dear Lord
I've been praying to you every day
I hope you're listening to everything I'm saying
I get money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money
I try, I try, I try, I try
I'm dying to get over
And once I'm done my gosh I know
That all my drama is over
And I thank you
They walk with that rope and they will hang you
On that vacation note
Damn, then they put a sign on the do '
Saying you don't know shit
You have to know how it goes
Or else you could end up in another pothole along the way
You see it
A prisoner of this war
We call america
And he already won, damn
And Armageddon and the depressions have already begun
But it is my aggression
Because I will extend you a little
I know my tired people
Of all the crying, all the dying
To get our minds out of crime and find something to find
That my life is at stake
Give me rope, and I'm going up
I hope the doors are open when I get there
Until then i'm alive
The lyrics of this song have not yet been released. Check back once the song has been released.
Yes, suffix, people, yes
You know
You, you, you already
Yeah come on
Kickin rocks on the block, telling all the OGs
"I will look for your place when you are not looking"
Hot kitchen, mom put it on the kitchen table
I thank God that we could always
Get the leather sofa, big screen, cable too
Nintendo when they got good grades
Then the cooked K arrived
I thought I heard the blacks coming, I thought I saw the police lights but
I was dreaming, then I woke up
The drug addicts were still diabolical, and I had Coke, so
I had hope you can say it's wrong
But I'm not talking to your son, I'm talking to this song
I'm just doing a lot of memory
And yes my niggas are the same but they are faster to hit
So I shoot first, and I would do the honors any day
Show your butt how to take four and get eight
And it doesn't take four niggas to straighten up
The only hot guy who eats from this plate, Young ...
Give your butt a location and a template
Show him how to work on the interstate
Stop working with that thinner weight, fix your brakes
Stop playing, because all we know is shooting
Is no one safe when it is for the sake of the children?
Hurricane cleans the south like an earthquake
We try to save face, but we don't have a place
We are on the way, pussies; move
You know us when you see us, put your jewelry
Put your cars on, put your clothes on, put your shoes on
It's that serious, buddy, pick up the news
It wasn't right, nigga, think of the hood, nigga
People who never had shit will never have shit
Shit, cause they're still gonna try to drive
Niggas with no lost families
Lives lost in traffic
But a black man has passion
Even though the bounce seems magical
Shit, but call me Siegfried
See how I turn a key to a hundred Gs
Yes, dear summer, summer breeze
Summer please know I live for you
Throw the handcuff beater open the lid for you
A few years I will have much news from you, but now I am here to help you.
I know niggas who shed a tear for you
Behind bars, try to get to you, they'll never see you
It's that real talk if you ever heard it, buddy
Shit hurts so much, it could hurt you, buddy
No commercials, no facade, no curves
The drought is here, not only the white slowed down
But that's the last thing, because the hustle is what we do
But rush with what? How are we doing?
Where are you sitting? What is he sitting on?
Stand up if you know it's true
Shit ... And this is after the disaster, this is not rap, this is a summary
Coming down from the G4, still tied
Break your head in the air, that's a cap
Make my car pick me up where I get
Quit work because it doesn't go where I live
Trash bags full of dollars
Dead presidents, I have to throw the bodies
Birdman, while we eat
So everyone eats from me
Feet off the ground, toes to the stars, reaching
When everything stopped, I proceeded
Fuck the world, not the people, damn it!
People who ask me "Wayne, what is crackalacking"? I can't fool
I'm not smelling my butt, mom, I'm not shit
But you can't tell my mom I'm not the shit
And if you talk about my mom bet, I'm completely on your shit
All things go to my mom because she brought me on this
And since I never miss her, I never called sick
I'm going to work, I don't quit, mom taught me this
'' You go crazy over that crib, baby, don't slip ''
I'll kill you for those fries and I'll make Frito Lay
I'm trying to go up to the fortress, divide it 3 to 4 ways
And you don't have to do anything but be your age
But mom, how can I? I will be so paid
She kept me with money, I keep her with money, she likes it
I gained weight
Pops happened, I had to take off my ass
I had to put it in bags and take off the grass
I used to carry whitish as cash
Now I carry guns like bags
Not much has changed
Still throw and give them a split or a trade
I never get up and change, I only get my change
I'm greasy with the game Joe Casey gave it to me I'm an animal
But niggas taste this and lick nuts like ladies
I wear quick jumpsuit and hit how it turns out
I deflate the game and insert my cock
That means I fuck the game, so fuck the game
I'm dying for the money, I say fuck the game
Man, niggas wonder why I got out, I won the game
I'm a champion
And when they paid me, I paid back what I owed
Make the haters know to crack when I'm hitting the roads
You know what's under the seat, I have Combat 4
I gave him a nigga, I bet he won't come back no more
No, it's Weezy F and the 'F' is for flow
I get it, I act like I'm back from coke
Not guilty or Jesus, let the rabbit go
Wow, that's my daddy if you don't know
And I love him with every second my hard day is gone
Who do you think drew that blood from that flo '?
How do you think that young man became so old?
I miss you pops
You tattooed your face
You yelled, "Suu whoop"
You bought a Bugatti, so you can flex
Most bad bitches your ex
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
New subject, new job, new class, new school
New friends, new enemies, new ass, new tits
Much later, very soon, very bad, very well
Too hot, too bright, too high to move
Two eyes to see but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you?
Two middle fingers that are tall for whom
You can consume, kaboom, damn
Who knew that I am the voodoo guru?
That sued you to hell
With shooters that shoot through the iron, man
I turned a damn into a plan of God
Check the diagram and go to work, man
Sit down and look and don't look at the hand of the clock
Give me some time man
I'm the bomb, man
I'm going to 'swim' until I get to dry land or in the pan
No we don't land at Plymouth Rock
But it landed on our land, now I'm just buying land
Back to the block where they got the most rock fans
We need Barack, man, I do what I can
To keep it solid like you know what I say
You tattooed your face and changed the culture (you changed)
You bought a Bugatti to be able to flex (so it can flex)
And most of the bad bitches your ex
I started this shit, you're just part of this shit
I'm the heart of this shit, and the heart doesn't skip
Take the heart of your bitch, because like Bart, you are a simp
And your water doesn't drip so your garden isn't shit
You only count the money, I'm drowning in money
Like, "Where the hell is this bitch's lifeguard?"
For the art of this shit, Andy Warhol and shit
I turn cake on this shit, I'm a nuisance on this shit
I'm Martian and shit, you're an orphan, little bitch
If I taught you shit, it's like Harvard, you little bitch
You're not talking shit but you're softer than shit
Walk the way you talk, now you walk in the shit
I'm going to the Marvel movie with wonderful shit
This is Tha Carter, you little bitch
You tattooed your face and changed the culture (you changed)
You screamed "Suu whoop", and those gangsters loved you (Yes, yes, yes, yes)
You bought a Bugatti to be able to flex (so it can flex)
And most of the bad bitches your ex
I started this shit, they borrowed this shit
I thought about this shit, they thought it was that
I'm chasing this shit, they bark and sit
Put a fork in that shit, which drawer to look in?
I brought this shit, the starters are on the bench
Orders are shipped, then targets are reached
Billion dollar smile
I sell short if I smile then I'm negotiating
Apartments and that shit, I could park in this shit
In the foreign car I could talk to and shit with
With a cultural bitch I can talk and shit
'About culture and shit, how I altered this shit
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
All that shit, just that bitch Carter
You changed, suu whoop (You tattooed your face)
Bugatti, new boo (you shouted, "Suu whoop")
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tattoos, suu whoop, Bugatti, new boo
Tunechi
(If it wasn't for Wayne, it wouldn't be)
They may think they have a good jump shot, or a pretty good flow. But all of our children can't claim to be LeBron or Lil Wayne!
Shout the blue flag
Yells the red flag
Scream the black flag
I'm not talking about any gang hit. I just wanted to say that surrender flag because I don't know if blacks really repeat white flags and that shit. So I mean the surrender flag so I don't get in trouble. No nigga is shooting at me I don't know what the hell happened. Nigga, a group of white flag niggas come in, "Nigga we are the white flag niggas." How sorry my nigga damn
Shout Drama, thanks again for letting me do this shit. Dedication 3, I can't wait until Dedication 4. And uh, this one here, man, this was for my fans, this was for young money, this was for you of course. But this was for young money so that you understand what I'm trying to do and get a little of what I've cooked here and see what blacks do. Also, I want to make it clear that every artist you hear on Young Money is likely doing their thing somewhere else, so what I'd love you to do is get, not just listen to them here, really come in and see what they're doing on everywhere, because if they're good here, chances are they're great there. I mean, pay attention to them, they are making movements. They are Makin's movements. And if you want to be with us, it's easy. It is easy. Give a nigger some head or something. Haha. Not homo, not for the niggas, though I'm not looking for more rappers. I don't even want to try, I'm straight. I am looking for beautiful, straight women. I'm not lying
Act like an idiot with that, get your butt back with that
Act like an idiot with that, come back with your butt
Act like an idiot with that, get your butt back with that
You know hoes love Weezy, let's say he's cute, small, long-haired, big dick
Weezy brings all of you, don't give up on your lips
Put your lips on this dick, let me live a little
Spit on your chin, Weezy be on pimp shit
I see them, I see them, I know them, I call them, later if she travels
G 'em, freak' em, by the weekend she'll be fucking the squad
She fucks my dog, the bitch sucks nuts and everything, and nothing small
This dick makes them touch the floor and touch the wall
Call my defending linemen, because they rush the balls
Let Weezy break his jaws (blurrrpp)
I never have elections, I hit them and I lose them
And go to the hotel and switch to ruggy
Like a hot, spicy, fiery girl, from the project that killed me
I'm so gangsta prissy chicks i don't want to fuck with me
Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it drop slow
Now walk with me, shake a leg, catch the wall
You gotta go back to your wits, act like an idiot
I have to go back to your wits, act like an idiot
Undress, show me something
And bungee jumping
That's right, act like a dumb bitch, do what you do, ho
After I'm done, don't get up, I have to let Weezy go
You get your accessories, your pussy shoots, girl, you're a pro
You better recognize it, you better realize
This is the black Geezy, I'm not at all nice
Love when you reach out, grab it, fill it directly to your mouth
Start sucking until that medium comes out
Ride me (ride me), put that dick inside you (inside you)
After that, move your ass, give me that loose
I'm a donkey, better yet veteran
At the same time I can fuck you and your best friend
Pumped in my head, never let a bitch play with me
Wrap a chain around your neck and walk like a dog
Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it drop slow
Now walk with me, shake a leg, catch the wall
You gotta go back to your wits, act like an idiot
Come on take it down, catch the wall
Tear that bitch dick, start buggin 'and
And bungee jumping
You gotta get your ass back with that, act like an ass with that
You gotta bend your ass with it, act like an ass with it
Cock hard like real wood
I put it slow and I work very well
I come when you wanted to like private jets
I'm exploding, why do you take it slower than your fast time?
Turn around again, do that ass well
Weezy makes you suck and then try, this is how the pimp plays
Make her friend eat me and this bitch like shrimp dishes
Bouncing around the club rolling on X, eyes completely black
I have 2 more nights, are you resourceful?
Fuck it, come on, we got a bottle of Moe '
Drop the top of the 'Dro
Later I'm touching my throat, wrong
Titty bop, drop it like it's hot, make it drop slow
Now walk with me, shake a leg, catch the wall
You gotta go back to your wits, act like an idiot
I have to go back to your wits, act like an idiot
Come on take it down, catch the wall
Undress, show me something
Tear that bitch dick, start buggin 'and
And bungee jumping
You gotta get your ass back with that, act like an ass with that
You gotta bend your ass with it, act like an ass with it
{whispers} Dedication 2 ...
Okay, I think you're ready this time
Call me Mr. Thanksgiving
Bang bang, I shot you
Bang bang, you hit the ground
Bang bang, that horrible sound
Ha, Dedication 2, that's correct, already ...
Wake up motherfuckers, it's Weezy, do you have a problem?
Addressing them, victims of Katrina, still mobbin '
The shiny black coupe at night looks like a leprechaun
AK in the backseat, baby, this is: {* rewinds the record *}
Wake up motherfuckers, it's Weezy, do you have a problem?
He heads towards them, victims of Katrina, still mobbin
AK in the back seat, baby, it's so alive
Watch me let it spray like a fire hydrant, I can't dodge it
Don't get wet in the rain it's not logical
Alive and direct from inside your bitch body
And, hello, what do you know I'm riding?
In the same streets where my parents died, I got them and
I get that money, tell my mom I'm grinding
And I will come home with our future in my pocket
Kill adults and let children be adopted
Sit in the pot and watch me rise to power
Take out twenty American cakes an hour
And you better put my money in my hand, stop playing!
I have ends, no friends, only brothers of one color
Yes, they knew better that I am two letters
I'm like M.J. and 2-3 and O.G., yes, I'm discreet
Cause niggas and bitches he's a cop
I'm Weezy baby!
Let me catch my breath ... {breathing}
OK...
Pussy-ass .. pussy-ass .. pussy-ass .. pussy ..
Pussy niggas, fake fraud niggas
Tryna save the past, niggas from SIM card
They laugh at you, those niggas won't kill you
And those niggas who are with you, could die well with you
I'll be shooting everything in my sight sir
And Lil Currensy will divide you, Mack Maine will turn you around
Let Taz Po send you, then we will all forget you
I'm sitting in the kitchen like "How can we get richer?"
I have paint in my hands when painting the perfect image
So I say to lil 'Josh, roll up the perfect Swisher
Damn the hurricane, weed man, we miss you
I'm the best, just listen, I'm not what the game has been missing
That's my nigga Juelz, I've been here since twelve
Ten shells, let them save
And this is just a mixtape, damn
Well, it's a little bit more than that.
It's more like a message
And this is just a mixtape, damn
It's more of a dedication
D3!
Is this what you were waiting for?
DJ Drama!
And I'm going to keep fucking this world
'Til mothafuckas come for me, yah (Ill!)
Don't worry if I have a gun
And all these niggas are murderers
And all these murderers with me, yeah
But you should be more afraid of the killer in me (Ohh!)
Because I'm about to kill them, I'm about to kill them
Because I'm about to kill them, I'm about to kill them
So fuck it, I'm going to kill them, fuck it, I'm going to kill them (Gangsta!)
So fuck it, I'm going to kill them, yeah!
And I'm going to keep fucking this world
Until the motherfuckers come for me, yeah
Don't worry if I have a gun
And all these niggas are murderers
And all these killers with me, yeah (Gangsta!)
But you should be scared of me (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Young veteran, who will soon be OG
Also, I spit like a toothless crack
I hear you little niggas barking, I want more meat
You like a black without weapons, you have no peace
And when it comes to money, my shit is obese
More money, what the hell are these niggas telling me?
I'm young Lucifer, take them to hell with me, yeah
If he testifies as Common, look at the fire bomb
If you know what's best Mothafucka calm down
These niggas starve here on a diet
While I'm eating, nigga, clutching my styrofoam
For now, I'm with your girl, lighting my Rowdy Roddy Piper
Willie the Kid, pull out the weapons like a hamstring
Blow like a trombone, funny niggas, tambourine
Without blood there is no lack, yes, my cold heart like Moscow
We nap you like a hot towel (Gangsta!)
All my hostile hoes, not me, never tell me "not now"
Roof remover, we leave your brain with more air
Maneuver, I leave your bitch with a wet chair (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Seduce her, yeah you rappers should be tired of lying
But I know it's hard as an iron tire
But it's still complex, like it's Mayan science
Or Aztec math, I'm crazy like a tabulator
And yes, you are Willie, how do I address you?
Or like a stylist, nobody flies like that
Are you crazy? I'm turning my brain like a psychiatrist
And I'm going to keep fucking this world
'Til mothafuckas come for me, yah (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Don't worry if I have a gun
And all these killers with me, yeah (Gangsta!)
But you should be afraid of me (Gangsta!)
Because I'm going to kill them, I'm going to kill them
Yes i will kill them yes i will kill them
And I kill them, I kill them
They say that the dust makes you hyperactive, that the reefer calms you
Cigarettes give you cancer, woo-woos make you boring
As I drink the purple harlot, thick as my southern accent
Put me on the ocean floor with a mermaid without drawings
They have bats in the cave, face down
Blood rushing to his head, they react from the sound
While I'm on the mound, tossing the crown
Old rappers complaining about what the business is
'About hip status, sounding like some bitches
Get your butt out of a rich black cock, it's ridiculous
The new nigga from school, what you should do is become a resident
Under conditions, lift your butt off your butt
Like Federer and Nadal, Young Money, nigga, we dance
Like Kobe or Chris Paul, forgiving a wack cookie
No cash, like, "Bitch, give me that ass"
Or approaching the parking lot like "Give me that Jag"
No, approaching the parking lot like "Give me that Lam"
They study me, yes, they get in, like it's a final exam
If I hit you on the back, you'll need a spinal exam
I am something like a rhino or ram, animal, beast
Irritate your pussies like chlamydia, yeast
Or be like this rhythm, R.I.P., deceased
Yeah i'm going to kill them yeah i'm killing them
I'm going to kill you (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
Yeah right, you better call all the pall carriers in your area
The ball carrier is going to burst, if I'm going to go around the block. The momentum on the swing stops, he will fall like a failure
On the court, I love sports, that's why I play my bitches
Cause I got a game, that's why you pay my bitches, yeah
I'm just jumping like two bunnies (Gangsta!)
Who runs it? Bitch nigga, moi
That was French, black, not a kiss, black, no
Ha, no homo, rappers eat like four and four
They say I fucked up so and so
And I say "So, so and so"
Nikes on his neck, they like, "Let me breathe"
Sorry, but I can't, this is how we feed (Gangsta Gri-zillz!)
This is why we are hot, this is how we freeze
Too fast to go on, that's why we lead
And the money in the pocket is not why we are Gs, look
This is how we shoot and this is how we go (Gangsta!)
You know we carry steel, this is how we facilitate
You can get the steel if you try these thieves now
Pass me the Swisher, let me climb these trees
And the haters say we couldn't, that's why we kiss
Like gravity pulling down
Like gravity pulling down

Young crazy mule

Lil Wayne speaking:
Yell at everyone man
You understand me
This real rock shit
He is becoming crazy
But hey, I keep rapping for you and shit

What I was saying at the end of that performance at the BET hip hop awards because I know they probably cut a lot of it
I had said huh
Give me a shot Gudda, come on oh yeah we're about to take him back to New Orleans, come on
Bitch mom didn't tell you f ** k not with them aliens
I'm just trying to mate like an Australian f ** king

(DJ Drama) Hahaha, you thought it was over, let me give you some D4
Bitch i feel
Yes!
AHHHHHH!
The game infuriated me, and I'm not talking about homie in LA, either.
I say i have so much money man i don't know what to do with it
I was thinking of getting something and letting you spend it
I'm sitting on them Jordan they must be the shoes on me
I become very ignorant
Cruel cruel
When it rains just tell them to get dumb in the pool
Who really pours with us?
Cause bitch I'm a better flow fl-y fl-y fly
No feathers
And if you want to taste bad, you will know better, yes
I'm talking about young army weezy aka money I also have enough money on me
Yeah and ya fake niggas
And I take off with rhythm
She makes you go out and only makes you and she only makes me
I told you
It's everyone man
You already knew, man
But this is a dedication to the streets.
The gangstas, the hood, the fallen soldiers.
Young Money, muh'fucka (dedication to my mom)
You understand me?
Dedication to our family
That was coming, you see how I spit
And we are Young Money, man
This is a dedication, people
They are gangsta grills, motherfuckers
Do you understand that and who am I?
I'm young Wayne, but now you can call me
This is "Tha Carter", people
Yes, you guessed it accurately; it's me ladies and gentlemen
Weezy F. Baby, please say Baby
Gangsta Grillz, everything on your grill
Drama holla in ya nigga
So now I'm burying the burner in the bomber
I am married to money and power.
And I still have weapons on my side for my private affairs
Yeah i know the water gets cold but i dive naked
And nothing through him alive and conscious, I've been through it
I do it like I do, I miss doing it
A drum of a hundred shots, play them music clip
All you need is a sign that you can get a cadence
You can serve him, I am at your service as a waiter
When it's beef, I become a black neighbor
I put potatoes in the heater without a label later
Now make me mash potatoes
French fries niggas, then bench and then niggas, goodbye niggas
I wet them like rivers, now I flow for niggas
I'm dripping and dry fly, now squint bitches
I rock the bitches of time, get out of the new Bentley's
I'm old school like a loose Winston
How since when do they make bulletproof skin?
I put it on your chin, and I smile, and I sin, and then
I sin again, and then I go in the wind
Cause I won't stop with the paraphernalia cop
Now I'm preparing an L, not preparing to fail
Because my flow is real like Sahara in hell
Comparisons are irrelevant, I'm an arrogant man, yeah
I can handle it, I can graduate Yale, yeah
They weigh, I sporadically ill
Check out the narrative of New Orleans heritage
You can go find your evidence, I tell you where and when
I was beginning my adolescence in
Less than God alone, better than the last, that's what I strive for
Living in my past I get high, so I light it up and smoke
Let Mary Poppins explode like a toaster
I am supercalifragilisticoexpialidoz
I can't forget that purple potion, oh shit
Shit, I explode more in MASH and laugh
I'm the best, no shit
The song goes like this:
Deeboa then low .. dun dun dun dun dun is like a deepoa
What is your name
No, no, stay awake
No, no, stay awake
She has a pussy like the Garden of Eden
I tiptoe through the tulips
And I'm going to get done, cross me off my to-do list
Loose lips sink the cruise
Even gigabytes get their two chips
Have a pillow fight with a cute bitch
With a body like a belly dancer
She says you're scared of this kitty, well, if he's a panther
I hope it's pink, I read her mind, yes, I read every chapter
I don't have time not to play games
Give me mind don't play
She says she will cut me off if I'm vain, I said "objection, sustained"
This shouldn't affect my darling
She says she sent from heaven
That is why all the flights were connected
I still wear protection, if she's a blessing in disguise
But I swear it is a very good costume, because I can't say
She wish she had me in the lock
But there are so many other niggas making time
In your brain cells, damn, huh
No, no, stay awake
No, no, stay awake
Am I sleeping with the devil?
How the hell should I know?
My heart beats with an echo because my insides are sacred
If someone has a towel, wipe the guilt off my face
My height is going down like my stilts about to break
And what goes, comes, a straw comes out
So she put that shit on me, I feel like some dirty drawings
She says "just don't leave me Wayne, because life is short"
I say "I'm touched but baby, pimpin 'is not a contact sport"
He dyed his hair, I asked him "when is the funeral?"
And Gisselle can leave her house without makeup and still be pretty
I pour her champagne, she put cocaine on me
And we forget everything and six-six-six nine, okay
No, no, stay awake
No, no, stay awake
Loosie hot pussy, she goes to my neck
But they shoot me, setting me loose, and I sweat when I'm around her
I regret when I'm close to her
Ask me "would I die for her?" I say "dead before designer"
Cause I see through her flames and she sees through my snow
She's going to be singing the blues, I hope she can play high notes for them
And I swear the pussy tastes like devil's food pie
Give me a toothache, I feel like fool's gold on April Fool's Day
But I'm not stupid for love because playing with love, you hurt yourself
No, no, stay awake
Am I sleeping with the devil? Hell yes I know
No, no, stay awake
No, no, stay awake
No, no, stay awake
Sleeping with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She is sleeping very softly, so now they start to enter
And now they're starting to guide me, geekin 'like Brittany
Adjusting my energy, eat and die sympathy
And love physically dies, my love cries miserably
She screwed up your niggas, look now that they're both matching me
But demons have dignity, demons have memories
'About to stop laughing and dinner starts to sizzle
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands.
He also took the demon out of his ass
I'm a devil, I demand of you
A demon with demands, a demon with demands.
Yes, yes, yes, I am a devil, I demand you
You brought the demon out of the man, ooh
I brought the devil out of the man, ooh
I brought the devil out of the man, ooh
You finished taking the demon out of the man, you took the demon out of his pants
Put the devil in your mouth and then get it out of your butt
He found a halo in his trash but does not speak of his past.
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands.
A demon, with demands, a demon, with demands.
A demon with demands, a demon with demands.
I'm a demon with demands, I have demons on demand
Yes, yes, yes, I'm also a demon on demand
Yes, I took the demon out of the man, ooh
She also agrees with my demands
You brought the devil out of the man, ooh
He also took the demon out of his ass
Sleeping with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
And now they're starting to guide me, geekin 'like Brittany
Adjusting my energy, eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry infamy, mentally revive
And love physically dies, my love cries miserably
Looser and tighter hugs, her tongue tied kissing me
She fucked up your niggas, now they're both matching me
But demons have dignity, demons have memories
I had a little revenge on myself so now I'm sentencing
'About to stop laughing and dinner starts to sizzle
A demon with demands
You finished taking the demon out of the man, you took the demon out of his pants
Put the devil in your mouth and then get it out of your butt
He found a halo in his trash but does not speak of his past.
He also took the demon out of his ass
You brought the devil out of the man, ooh
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic
Demonic, demonic, demonic
Demon with demands, demon with demands
I think I'm seeing things
When I don't see anything
I woke up and realized
All the nightmares that dream brings
Let my people go
Now load the helicopters
Aim it at the coppers
Let-let freedom ring
I like the sweetest things
So what a bitch, no needle thread
I wake up, stretch my feet and wings
My life has no scenes erased
Pop-pop-pop and I leave the scene
Leave the Noxzema scene clean
Drinking that lean kitchen
Amazing Hulk on Creatine
Fuck the world
And I can mention, fuck the world again
Tune in, do you want to go around the world again?
I am
And you can trust a nigga like fam
I'm hitting these licks with my niggas like seals
Giving these hoes headaches like rams
Yes ma'am
And me
I could call your friend friend
But fuck her like she's my girlfriend
Talk to her like she's my girl
Oops, you look like my girl's twin
Peco, I'm bad, I wanted to say "my bad"
I'm lost in the future, present, past
All those drinks that I had
I speed up, I'm fast, I blink, I crash
They say it's my time
I'm running, I think I'm the last
And if Tune mentions read again
The underdogs understand what I put on the slopes
New school, but all I hear are older raps
Bitch still
I've still been drinking under my breath
And the pimp is not dead and the money grows old
And now the wrinkles start to show
My tires sparkle like a toe
One thing led to another, and then the pencil broke.
I have it; gun on the table, shotgun in the closet
Disguised police, I don't like surprises
I don't like tomatoes, I don't like tamales
I scream at my plugs, I pray that rats don't chew on wires
Straight ball, niggas, just bald
When they tried to read my palms, the pages tore off
And you pussy niggas get dragged
There are no cough drops
I'm trying to make the same money as the rap they did with pop
I killed more than I did with a skill weapon
I am not a role model
I'm rolling with models, rolling pills
I'm spinning
Whoever is not rolling with us, then kill the road
Tryna Gets Uncle Phil's Pie
In case I die trying, I wrote Wills
Until I can't crack the code
To open the damn safe
Who the hell left the cage open?
Anger stage
I'm able to blow your fucking open face
Every bone you could break, broken
If I go bankrupt, every home I could break into would break
Pussy looks like a steak smoking
Niggas slipping like the frozen lake
And I hate rodents
Out of the powerful straight
Until it makes no sense
Niggas talking shit
Nigga I can make you wake up
Nigga can you imagine that
Until you break your lens
Nigga take your ends
Nigga fuck your ho
Nigga cuts your throat
Taking out your trash
Get up slowly
Going nowhere fast
Nigga hung them on a rope
Fuck it bye
Fuck it, I don't care
I got a bad bitch naked
And she just asked
"What are you going to do to me that I haven't done to myself?"
I say "Ooh, talk dirty, but don't talk much"
You leave Wayne's world, it's a long way home
My pockets on that growth hormone
I call them shots, can I get a ringtone?
Yes
Mule, can I get a million?
'Up to the heads or tails
Full promise, full house
And what are they friends for?
I'm still the boss, don't send me on
Roger that, 10-4
Nigga send me, put them down
Where he got them
We don't want to see you back in court
The grass so strong bitches are ignored
Because I don't have time to come and go
Bitch if you ask
Feeling like an A-bar after ‘roids
I'm from Prov city
And i'm from new orleans
The part that is destroyed
Come on
She is a girl
Someone says he saw us kissing at the movies
We have a drink or two
We saw rush hour 2
Then we went home and made our own movie
Lights, camera, action, do you dig?
Lights, camera, action, do you dig?
It's show time, it's show time, show me yours, I'll show you mine
Like ooh, ooh, ooh, it's sinking in this bitch
Like a boxer in the first round on this bitch
1-800, I'd shit on this bitch
Uptown on this bitch, don't make a noise on this, shh
Now let me whisper in your ear
Every word your little ear wants to hear
Can I put my tongue here until you break?
Cry baby, cry baby, suck your titty mom
You know I like them old, I could have your mom with me
I like your girlfriend and your girlfriends
Honor my flagpole at the end, bitch
Lights, camera, action, do you dig?
Lights, camera, action, do you dig?
It's show time, it's show time, show me yours, I'll show you mine
Lights, camera, action, do you dig?
Lights, camera, action, do you dig?
It's show time, it's show time, show me yours, I'll show you mine
But I don't give a shit about a dog's ass
Take these pills, take, take this glass
Pop, pop that pussy, shake, shake that ass
And if your pussy sucks, girl, you know you better shower it
You're nasty, girl, now wash that pussy, you cranky, funky bitch
And I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place cause you and your man plan to hate
I'm so bell
And she likes it, and when we fuck, I keep on with my Nikes
I will break that pussy, I will break that pussy
I'm a handsome rapper, I'm not trying to go to the front
Oh she broke out at a handstand
Oh she broke out at a handstand
Lights, camera, action, do you dig?
Lights, camera, action, do you dig?
It's show time, it's show time, show me yours, I'll show you mine
Cut, check the doors
Wait, why wait?
Do what I want, do what I want
You heard me, I have to lie
And now, every once in a while, your knees buck
She forgets how to walk, I better teach her
I have her walking fun, just tell them your feet hurt
But don't worry, because if everyone is like swingers
Are you crazy, say "The baby"
I'm a nigga from the east side, but my friends from uptown
I'm a nigga from the east side, but my friends from uptown
I'm a nigga on the east side
I have the 2-2-3 armed, I aim it at your melon
Loose lips sink ships, so it's not a damn revelation
Turn up the gas in the minivan, put the pumps in the trunk
Now I'm drinking something, they made me lean to one side
Black ski mask, Chinese red eyes
Now I've been hungry for years, I'm going to take your plate
I'm eating your dead steak on your face
One named Nina and my side bitch barks
I have something on my side that has a kick, that's my buddy
I'm on that paper roll the dice and get paid
Gudda!
I'm a nigga from the east side, but my friends from uptown
I'm a nigga from the east side, but my friends from uptown
Money is not made
These niggas will make me kill them
You should probably see a psychiatrist, but I'm afraid he'll make me small
I have too many hoes, that's my dilemma
I got a billion bitches, I'm looking for the one that got away
And as all these niggas watch, ask them what time of day
Fuck all of you niggas I'm skating
I have you in the skate park waiting
That dick keeps her coming back, damn reincarnation
I don't want that pussy if it's awful
Hello, my name is Tune, it is good to eat you
I still keep that gun a secret
Another one bites the dust, would you like to eat it?
You don't want to hit my blunt because I've been eating pussy all day
This gun has a hair trigger, pull this bitch until she has a bald head
You have no bars, black
Reload, you're going to die
You can't kill me, I was born dead
Thorned head
Red devil horns, they have my barn head
I'm a serial killer, your lucky charm is dead
And that garbage bag, they find you arm leg leg leg leg arm head
Oh what a tangled web we weave I feel like daddy long legs
My bitch says my dick is great
Bop bop and I'm leaving
I am devastation, I am Freddy Jason, Dedication 5, 5 stars
Tunechi
Smoking heavy, long money, we don't reason
Playing in the middle of a drought, we are not worried
Middle finger towards the judge and I'm smiling
Bring your squad because you know my gang with me
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds snatching
Commas, commas, commas, commas, comma change
We fight time and time and time and time and time and time
Again
I said to my socket "You know what I need
Of you when I get on
Yeah uh
Two bricks, a triple beam and a foam.
Then I can make a storm like I usually do "
Banging with my friends, nigga, that's Soo-woo
You will be so difficult to identify when you are
Hitting from the arms to the calluses and still bleeding
All my niggas corn sons like Stephen
King: I met this broad, she had curves
Bitch started twerking when the whips start screaming
Getting money from 'Got Money'
And if you could really answer for me
I still need my money Block Is Hot
I'm not fucking with these pussies like they have something
Trampoline with work, I got the block to jump
I said to my socket "You know what I need
Of you when I get on
Yes
Two bricks, a triple beam and a foam.
Then I can make a storm like I usually do "
Trampoline on this dick, I made her pussy jump
Petroleum jelly on a brick in case the police come
Trafficking work in her bra for me
Wearing lingerie and heels around the house for me
All these bitches try to relax and then thaw
Trampoline with work, I got the block to jump
I have the block
We are drinking that dirty
Yes
This Gat pointed your nose, nigga
That vest can't save your soul, no
We're drinking that dirty, yeah
We are making them dirty
I haven't even heard from you
You left the kids alone
We are unstable, yeah
We are unstable, yeah
Your mom is afraid of us
We are unstable, yeah
You are ungrateful, yes
That's why I changed my label, yeah
I have to live for myself, yeah
I have to give myself, yeah
Look at all the shit I gave you
See what I did for myself
I never hid from myself, no
I have no roofs yeah
I don't wanna deal with them niggas, no
Ungrateful
Yes, baby C3
Young Weezy and Young Curren $ y
You understand me?
Diamonds and girls
Diamonds and girls
Diamonds and girls
Di-diamonds and girls, and girls, and girls.
Di-diamonds and -
get em
Like five, six chains in
Slick Rick, no patch, just frames on
Marc Jacobs Aviators and V Neck
Ten bitches, ten guns in the P-jet
In a top drop Madina with the top up
I'm on that bitch holding my neck like a bullet throw
A hundred thousand for the grill, if I lie, I die
Flow sick, so sick, look at the cyanide
And here is my funniest joke: I'm broke
Don't worry about me, money has me
And I keep the burner on me like an I.D
And leaves a bitch trapped like a kite in a tree
Weezy F.B., money is the problem
Coming from the bottom of the map
But standing on top of the game
Kush has a nigga who looks like he could really nap
But I'm still wild with the gang
I have diamonds on my chain, more colors than the northern lights
Life is a bottleneck but I'm on a motorcycle
Zigzagging past these bastards, laughing at them
I have them suicidal as the doors of the Ghost
I don't try to block them because I'm not an officer
I only knock them down in groups of ten
Like I'm on the lane looking for bowling
So the style change so fast
Do you think the disc was skipped?
Have them bring it back like pass interference
Speedboat, handcuff blender
Dancing like Derek Jeter for all the reasons
The same color as sesame-a, diarrhea
The nasty clock like gonorrhea
Long money like Nia, I appear by satellite
Who does not like the premiere, is hermaphrodite
Vegetables in my ear, rinse it
And if I ever jump off a pier, I'd probably fly
Young Weezy in this motherfucker handcuffed her
She is nothing more than stairs, I ended up running for her
I feel like players hate looks, they don't say anything
They are not gaining anything from the cats, they are not taking anything
I'm waking up the mother, we're just fucking
She has a date with the boy, super lucky bitch
And money still smells like things
I've been counting all day, I have a hundred paper cuts
I have a syrup mouth and a white paper cup
I'm the personal trainer, take the key, shape it
I have rocks on my neck, nigga, lift your nature
Smokin 'in that gum got a numb nigga
90 G's on each wrist make a bitch cum
I just spent a Maserati on my chain man
So when I move, I'm just saying I'm changing lanes, man
I made a permanent stain, my name name-brand
I'm a rock star, niggas know the part of the block
Hard-roof cars, also roof drops
Hard work, soft work, cut, chop and sell
Hand hammer, pop pop oh well
Diamonds all over my chain, flaming all over the L
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my neck
I'm smoking pounds of green, smoking pounds of green
Smoking pounds of green, smoking pounds of green
Hot baby, hotter than the other kids
I'm the nigga who loves your baby mom
Spend your child support on the dress and you're running off
The young man is somewhat stunned without a belly
The Testarosa has an ulcer, I'm just doing a trick
Birdman JR, I get that money
I dance hard like the playoff bitch
Niggas ain't playing in the championship anymore, shit
Where are my streets, nigga where are my G's?
I have a bitch named Keisha, she is a real complacent
But Shawty from Cuba still works on a visa
His girlfriend Lisa met her in Puerto Rico.
How can you not suck your cock but expect me to eat it?
I have a bitch named Keisha, she is a real complacent
I have a bitch named Keisha, she is a real complacent
But Shawty from Cuba, still working on her visa
How can he not suck his cock, but expect me to eat it?
How crazy man you don't want to meet her
But her friend Nita swallows semen for the liter
She looks good in shorts and a whisk
But this other girl, Quita, is much sexier than Nita
But I'm a damn freezer, yeah, I'm going to put it down.
Smoke like a Cohiba, you give me brain
Now go down and touch my toes for my people
And if you're not fucking with me, then you're also not fucking with me
Do you think your man is sexy? Well fuck it ether
I heard that I have a look, I want to kick it like FIFA
Every day Christmas, cause I'm smoking that crown-a (reefer)
Keep a lot of bitches like Queen Latifah
I'm from the south, not Kiefer
Y-M-E for Young Money Entertainment, ha
Do you want meat? Then my money will fix it
I'm not fucking finna point it
Yeah hollygrove biatch
Careless like Joe, you better go find G.I
All my weapons knee high, M-O-N-E-Y
University institution, finals and confusion.
Give up your excuses, hip-hop, I'm seducing
Man, I will fuck your girl until her pussy has no juice
Look, the problem I have with the game is
There are no guardians in hip hop
I mean, can someone put a combination lock on the door?
And stop giving the code?
I met this monster named Tammy by the way
She used to go to Catholic school on the day
Now she strips naked at Sue's for a stack a day
I have a bitch named Lola, real cock smoker
Her cousin named Mocha has a crazy spine
But it's crazy because I fucked both of them at the same time
I even got a bitch in the bay named Jessica
I swear, she could give the best mouth in America
Vanessa has an attitude, but her baddest ass
She reminds me of this girl who used to fuck named Sabrina
I only stayed because her butt was amazing
When I come, they touch tongues and share that nut
In my mom, her head golden like an Oscar
And I met her through Tasha
In the condo she let me fuck her in the washing machine
September nigga so you know it's nasty
Now I tell a bitch like this
You have to take 10 cocks before you meet the president
Young Money!
I know this darling
I call her a track star, because when we fuck she runs away from me
My herb, true plum and true gum
And my flow is harder than an anvil, honey
Shoot these niggas with the handheld, baby
Niggas kill with me and kill for me
We better believe we ride if the fan belt is running
Leave a motherfucker just lying there bloody
I'm from the dirt and I make it rain, damn, that's muddy
She just wants to be my loving friend
And on these tracks I go crazy
Baby?
Carter Trey, all day, let's play haha
I know two girls who did it did it before
But I wonder if they know we did it before
If the other girl knows we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows well if she doesn't know
That we did it before, yes, we did it before
That we did it before, yes, we did it before
Shit, I wonder if they know we did it before
Well raise your hands if you did it before
Now your girl looks at you because she didn't know
And now they all say you did it before
Because if they did it before, it would be different
With Nisa, I wonder if she didn't know
And we did it before, we can get it fa 'sho
I'm a tear that the fuck, like I didn't before
And after I did it, they'll be history
When I see them, I act like I don't know
Okay
I know two girls who did it did it before
But I wonder if they know we did it before
If the other girl knows we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows well if she doesn't know
That we did it before, yes, we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows well if she doesn't know
That we did it before, yes, we did it before
Shit, I wonder if they know we did it before
You have to act like you didn't before
They say she didn't do it before
You know I must act like I never did before
But it would be silly if I didn't know
If she thinks I didn't, hell knows
That she did it before, probably didn't go down
So we did it a little bit more and we did it a little bit more
So we did it a little bit more, yeah, we did it until four
And when four or one came, she was knocking on the door
I'm not getting ready to go, but she was knocking on the door
And he was probably naked, just spinning an O
Then I call my friends, kick the shit how it goes
And I know they'll laugh because they did it before
Okay
I know two girls who did it did it before
But I wonder if they know we did it before
If the other girl knows we did it before
That we did it before, yes, we did it before
Shit, I wonder if they know we did it before
Okay, a lot of people don't like to say they did it before
Or if they did it with more than one, or they did it for mass
And he just rocks everyone, that done he did before
I know I did it before, you know you did it before
Oh that's your best friend, yeah, you'll kick it, I know
You probably did it before, you probably licked it before
Like it was liquid before, yeah, I can see them both
As i did before because i did before
Okay
I know two girls who did it did it before
But I wonder if they know we did it before
If the other girl knows we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows well if she doesn't know
That we did it before, yes, we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows well if she doesn't know
That we did it before, yes, we did it before
Shit, I wonder if they know we did it before
Woo ... Dis Feel Good ... Arite Ye ... Carter 3 ... All day ... Let's play
(Chorus:)
Ok, I know that 2 Dat Don girls did it before

If the other girl knows what we did before
Dat we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows or if she hadn't
Dat we did it before
Yes we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows what we did before
(Verse 1 :)
And now your girl looks at you because she didn't know
And you know Dats because Dey probably didn't before
Because if Dey did it before
I wonder if Tammy knows what I did before
Lisa wit I wonder if she hadn't known
Dat we did it before
I know Dey did it before
Da Day we did it but oh
If Dey didn't do it before
And we didn't do it before
We can get it for Sho
She should be Wit Fo Sho
And then I did Dey Wer History although
Dat we did it before
How we didn't do it before
But we did it before
(Chorus:)
Ok, I know that 2 Dat Done girls did it before
But I wonder if Dey knows if we did it before
If the other girl knows what we did before
Shit, I wonder if she knows or if she hadn't
Dat we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows or if she hadn't
Dat we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows what we did before
(Verse 2 :)
Yes ... so if you did it before
Be a professional, you have to act like you did before
And every time I meet a girl Dat says he didn't do it before
But she would be dumb if she hadn't known
Dat I did it before
Because i did before
And it would be silly to think that I didn't know
Dat did it before
Probably did it in abundance
So we did a little bit more
And we did a little bit more
As Busta Rhyme said she Holla give me a little more
So we did a little bit more
Yes we did until four
And when 4:01 came, there was a knock on the door
Not fixing to go
And I was probably butt naked just spinning Da O
Den I call my friends and kick shit how it goes
And I know they laughed because they did it before
(Chorus:)
Ok, I know that 2 Dat Done girls did it before
But I wonder if Dey knows if we did it before
If the other girl knows what we did before
Shit, I wonder if she knows or if she hadn't
Dat we did it before
Yes we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows or if she hadn't
Dat we did it before
Yes we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows what we did before
(Verse 3 :)
Dat Dey did it before
Or if Dey knew more
Da One I did it for dough
Be cool wit and flow
And Just Rock Wit that everyone did, did before
I know I did it before
How come you don't know, but did you know before?
They probably did it before
Like it was liquid before
Yes i can see them both
Like I did it, I did it before
Ok, I know that 2 Dat Done girls did it before
But I wonder if Dey knows if we did it before
If the other girl knows what we did before
Shit, I wonder if she knows or if she hadn't
What we did before
Yes we did it before
What we did before
Yes we did it before
Shit, I wonder if she knows what we did before
Hahaha
Amy
Young Mule Baby (hahaha)
Weezy, are you ready?
Let's go
I'm a flirt
I'm professional
I'm a weirdo
I have a different girl every day of the week.
I blow it up every day, I got a new girl
Booty Suzie goes well with all six whites
Lil Keshia loves role play but I'm a beast
Looking at his body thinking, "boy, I'm about to party"
I love women but shit I love money
Make it rain at the strip club like a doll
Homie rolls the game and he wears a lot of jewelry
You lazy, bore me, your baby, mom, call me
Little piggy so they call me John Coffee
Look at a flock of women that I'll run through them gently
I don't know what you're doing, dirty your mouth
I want a girl with a name like delicious!
I want a rabbit from Sunday to Monday!
I'm a flirt
I'm professional
I have a different girl every day of the week.
I am a blood, I am a scroll, I am a G
But that doesn't mean neptune in the beat
Because it's Nu Jersey Devil from Blackwall Street
Weezy f young baby money baby
Like the Easter bunny, the baby wanted my candy
So I gave him my paddle and then he made his body explode
I'm lying that you made me hot sauna
But please stop sweating me
Women scream "Come into me"
Right left on them Mr. Eterceden head all the time
Put it on the line or just put it in carter
And yes, I hear you scream, but my name is not more difficult
I'm a flirt
I'm professional
I have a different girl every day of the week.
I'm a flirty man, I really don't care
I tell women what they want to hear
Mommy I'm dancing, I'm so sincere
Is that your house girl sitting right there?
She can be my monday
You can be my Tuesday
After a little while, I can squeeze it in two days
Three is not a crowd, I don't care what you say
My women come in two like shoes with a cute face
My girl has a girlfriend, her girl has a girlfriend
Bring her to the crib, I'll show you how to get through
Little man in the boat here come the snakes
I'm with my trash on Thursday she's a real freek
One hundred big hairs on his cheek
Mrs. Friday goes crazy because she's just running
Here you are, sir, however you like
Be careful, it's hot
Enjoy...
Okay, come be my appetizer
My fruit, my apple cider, my laundry
My papaya, how do you want it?
I told him not to bring me a plate
If you don't have a rapper
Chef Angel on the beat
Yes i am eating with my hands
I'm going to need a napkin, buddy
You look like a glazed pig
With an apple
I need a Snapple, buddy
And another later, friend
Snap, homie
There goes another rapper
You're just a macaroon
I'm getting fat and you're bony
Richie calls me Biggie
Tell the bonjour bitches
Boy i eat your food
And I'm not close to being full
I hope you enjoyed your appetizer
Okay, cuz I'm hungrier than a motherfucker
Finger licking has never been a jerk
That means I make the club jump, I'm grubbin
The rappers say, "Hi Wayne," I reply, "How about dinner?"
I could fry your ass until it sauté
Marinated all day long
I like my stir-fried shit
Because all the salty rappers
Because all the rappers blame me
Because I'm the best rapper rapping
Rappers you can call me
The best rapper rappin '
I am a dog i am a beast
Cause I'm a damn buzz B
I should get a piece of that cake
Before die
Because if no one else deserves it
And now for dessert ...
Yes this is dessert
For him and for her
I will take it
Kiss her
Make her pussy purr
Wet zipper
Never fall in love with a stripper
Like strawberries, I dip it
In whipped cream, I whip it
I let it melt, then I drink it
As sizzurp, I am trying to quit sizzurp
Because moms say stop the sizzle
But my aunt mom stumbling, she's a traveler
But I'll take my time with it
Like a 3-legged cake, I have to climb
But it's not sweet shit when I'm on it
When I'm there I said you were going to miss me
If i hit it
I'm done with that
And no one else can do what I did with it
Not what i did i did
My tongue drips
Young Mule Baby, hehe
"Dipset"
Cut music on Drew phones
My hair is blocking me
My shit grows like my money ... Hah
Let's go
Yeazzzzirrr
Uh ... I'm so Dipset - Dipsouth Baby
If you don't like nigga, fuck you with an AIDS cock
Don't talk fast, I'm in that syrup, I'm in that turtle time
If the murderer says the black is dead, then a dead black
If stunner says the black is dead, then a dead black
This is not Tommy Hilfiger, this is Polo Ho
We are the largest group alive to achieve that solo mass.
And we will get that dough until they say there is no more dough
I smoke that ounce
I have that bounce
I have that pogo flow
I am a robot and this robot is overloaded
And bitch, I'll always be hot like I'm in coats
Um ... dollar after dollar
Holla in ya Guala
I need a bottle of water
And if you need a pill
T. Streetz and Carter got them
Supplies the whole party
We have the party exploding
We are in New Orleans popping
In California popping up
They Ed Hardy rock the skinny bitch with all those problems
Bitch, can you eat these pills, relax and tell me all about them
Lift my heart is pounding
Don't worry, the water stops it
Keep your mouth dry
Don't worry, the water mops it
I have a great idea
We should have sex
Bitch I'm like Dante Hall
I just throw up the X
My cock is still hard
I'm so ready for the next one
That's when you slip and fuck, and fuck your ex
Let that shit be
And I fucking rap!
DipSouth ... Already Digggg
This is just my interpretation of the situation
What is Poppin's dedication? 4 h (D4)
And this is dedicated, first
To my city
The lost city of New Orleans
But umm, I want to talk to my city
We can't get lost for long
And we are sure that it cannot be lost forever
So it's time for us to meet
Time to meet, New Orleans
Because memories are everything
And when I say that memories are everything
I mean, it's important what I remind you of
I don't want to be remembered as the lost city.
I'd rather be reminded of the city that found glory after all that tragedy.
I also built that skate park there and took the kids off the streets
You are welcome
But umm, we gotta get up man
Get up on top of it
So many people ask me
What are you going to do for your city?
I'm like a son of a bitch, don't you hear what you just said?
What did you do for your city?
Motherfucker, that's my city
Therefore, I still have relatives in that city.
What the hell am I going to do for them?
You know what I mean?
And I do my best, trust me
And that's what I do for my city
That's what i do for my city
I do for my city
So my city reminds me
Do you already dig?
And this is also dedicated to
You broke niggas yeah
Pause
I can't take your ass niggas
And this also dedicated to bad bitches
I know I talk about them bitches and she in the real parts all the time
But um it's dedicated to them chocolate women
Do you already dig? I don't say bitches or hoes
Not as it seems
Yes
And this is dedicated to them bitches yella and bitches red
You know what I'm talking? Ugh
It's also dedicated to my niggas, my friends
They still pump that bass
Silly nigga for dick nigga
It's dedicated to all my damn niggas who screw this up
Pause
I've been depressed from day one
Nigga, they've been with me since day two
Nigga, they've been despising me since today
This black love
And this song is also dedicated to the motherfuckers who helped with this mixtape
My black Mike Bailey
My young nigga jeezy
J Cole
J Gutter
The beautiful Nicki Minaj
DJ Drama
My nigga complexion Poe, Mack Maine
Know what it is
Stunna man
All young money, cash man
It's also dedicated to my skatin niggas
Truk fit, truk the world
Fyber O, DJ Crack

Shout out to the world of skating hoes
I thank you all for accepting a true black
Bustin 'my butt and shit but um
Pause, I get it

Fuck you?
And this also dedicated to you
Whoever you are
Wherever you are
Whatever
I hope to be remembered
Rest in peace Chris Lighty
Kush, good kush, yeah
And I know exactly where to put these hollow tips
Your chest, your chest, your chest
Yes, ayo, I face a gang of gangs, anything, animals, orangutans
Gorillas turn to Bathing Apes, when I make it rain
I have a complete collection, I have a drug connection
I have a coca cola connection, I have a mass infection
No homo, my flow is as hard as a boner
Haha, pay attention to the conference
Smelling the teenage spirit, like Kurt Cobain was here
Yes, yes, we have them here.
And we'll hit here, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the bank is here, Lincoln here
And the drink is here, wet is here, it stinks here
Gangstas here, wankstas fear ... that red motherfucker
And my hot city rides itchy cock
Coupe with boobs pop, fucks a city cop
And I have the enemy like, when will it stop?
Maybe a minute later never put your watches on
I'm crazy, Uptown, my birthplace
They feel me coming like the weekend of Thursday
And when I walk into the building, you know, wet bitch
Wet bitch, wet bitch, fuck now
Hahaha
Yes, gloves, drawings, socks, shirts
All done by Ralph Lauren
No shadows, just my eyes looking at them
Tattoos on top of them
Igloos for watches and champagne for breakfast.
Like rappers and I call it pussy for dinner
Yes, ask the paparazzi, I am in the Maserati
Ridin shotty, bad bitch, Clyde and Bonnie
I call her Kami, that short for kamikaze
She calls me daddy, and she never falls short with daddy's money
I'm never broke, I never have a cast on me
Always paid, I always have cash with me
I have to feed, my pants pockets hungry
I'm a ghost carrier, a shooter, not a fighter
And your girlfriend is a determined call from Carter
Control a bitch and let a nigga hold a bitch
I put her in the fucking corner, let her make a porn movie
She will reprise the role every time I shoot again.
Yes, work, work, tell her to be my slave
Bitch pay me out of my cage I just can't feel my face
Supreme Da Da, Young Moolah, Bird Junior
Yes, Ja
(chewing)
That right there ...
Wait
(takes a puff)
Nigga eating gummy bears and shit ... study
Could that album be coming out
That was disk 1, Drought 3
It's about to be disk 2
I hope you have free o'em bofe
If you didn't, stupid muhfu '
Anyway
Shoutout Nelly, JD
Blocked
Marly, don't shoot them
It's Disc 2, Drought 3, Bitch!
Blane rose gold while I have your hoe
Don't even mention the flow
I don't even like rap
I only do it for junk
I have chrome on my lap
Toast in my lap
Crossing the city
Fox fur on my back
Man, niggas is crazy
Also, this young money cream made me act like this
Because nowadays I don't have a package that breaks
Maintain ties to the streets so you don't have to go back
Certified pimp, good faith mack
I really back off
I don't chase that cat
Because Lil Boo just isn't good
Nigga act hard then he will lie down
Look at my face nigga I don't play around
Hello to me
Mack Maine, huh
Tommy over me is not a son of Hilfiger
Grip blowing macks
Fit Black Dickie, Black Hat, Black Girbauds
In something they can't pay
No, I'm not talking about a Honda Accord
Young Money, the tour
Bad bitches adore
They left us all in their values
They say I'm so hood
Puff that well well
They all have a good jug
Being in a black truck
I'm prolly with izzel
Baby prolly with royal trill
You know we get up
And heck, yeah, back in the G
I'm about to have seeds
Nigga just feed
Yes
I have it all black porsche
On them two black buttons
Mix so well
It seems like I'm getting rid of nothing
I talk a lot of shit but I'm not lying about anything
She loves my satin sheets It's like I'm lying about nothing
Weezy F Bitch Baby
If you don't say the baby
You disgust me
Young money girl
Take these dicks
The new AKs have a crazy grip
Hottest hot bitch
Recognize black
I don't have lamborghini doors on that ladder
I'm just going to look for Da Lamborghini
South of fear
Crazy about bread
Don't give my name to the feds
Cause they say I'm so grove
I'm hot so stove
Weezy
Yes, why am I so flying? I do not know
Is that a CL5? Oh sure
Who do you have inside?
Some other black hoe
Curren $ and the hotspitta he a G
Bitches take me to eat
One thing about the child
To the cold I spat
If she's not about to suck and fuck, she won't come to my house
Yeah niggas know how I do it
When I was at school with my Guccis all black
Sitting in the back of the class acting stupid
Or in a C-Murder truck taking bitches to the movies
Back on the heezy baby
He is so disrespectful to these women.
Fijian water, grandpa purp
Excuse me, I let the semi-automatic burp
Mothafucka blood gang, call me red alert
Young Carter kills in order, who gets it first?
Fill that girl with cock until her head explodes
Young Weezle flow needles, I can thread shirts
Boy you didn't do shit I said worse
Fiji Water, OG Kush
I have the stove on my waist and we cook
I'm on the way, you can't pass, like Aaron Brooks
I let my driver drive, I'm on par 4
Spit hanging from my mouth, slow the flow
And I say what I won as an award show
Sit back and watch the green grow like wet grass
Young or old, there is no comparison with me
I'm about to go almonds
Young head buster, get your helmets
You very soft niggas, what is that, velvet?
I'm about to eat nuts
We receive 7 digit money, you can call us
Hit them with the helicopter, watch them ball up
Yes, young Nino, black
Do it for my team, Tim Tebow, black
Swallowed by the Maybach, deep throat, black!
I'm about to plant
I'm still at my best, Deion Sanders
All the players, I won't lose
Precious as diamonds flow, I drop jewels
Give me mine or I'll take mine
Smoking purple, I heard it through the vine
Weezy Baby, also known as His Highness
I just killed this shit, moment of silence
I'm in the zone like a fastball
And I fuck the game up like a bad decision
Let the money accumulate, don't drop the cash
You sweep all day, there's no last call
Birdman Jr., wings spread over niggas
Dr. Carter has a little lean in his IVs
Strong and dry grass, it makes my eyes bleed
Strong blow to the arm, I wiggle an iron sleeve
I'm a dog on the beat, fuck the vet
I'm in the zone like the college ball
I spit fire like I'm drinking a Molotov
Loose intestines, this shit is so easy
(I could send this to The Mixtape Weezy)
Hears
I remember the way
We are together
Forever and one day
Well i guess that day
Cus now
We are apart and far
And it feels so lost
N.G.E. you wouldn't say
Call your bay
And I just wish we could
"do it again" (X3)
Hears
But time is a mistake.
And me
For you as always
Given another chance to
"do it again"
Like i died
And went to heaven
Climbed inside a treasure
He died within pleasure like
Wow
Your smile is more essential
Your son is so precious
I wish
It was paternally mine
But karma is a message.
But I will try to prove it
And scream for a blessing
So noisy
And I hope you catch it
And one day you would come falling
Then I'll be there to catch you
I'll be there to leave you
Do things
We didn't before
Next time we have to stretch it
Never forget
i never forgot
I wish we could
"do it again" (X3)
Hears
I'm just trying to talk to you
If I could talk to you
Den I would speak
Forever and one day
Yes i remember
So vividly
How would we be
When we go to bed
And my blue skies
They were no longer gray
She made my day so happy
Put it in writing
If perfect had a face
I promise you friend
Would you be hungry like me?
If you had a taste
Your girl is a flower
A flower without a vase
No water needed at all
She keeps growing
More beautiful every day
And I love her something vicious
And I'm just wishing
"do it again" (X3)
Well it's ok i can't feel my face i go first
And my grill is sick
Did i do that
Throwing signs like I'm in a fraternity
Eagle Street, bitch
And I keep it funky like the pubic scent
Put them in a coma
Now what does that boy have? Umm, glaucoma (haha)
My grass is stronger, I smell great
I like the promise, I'm in a snail race
And my watch reminds me of '88
Because I have cracks on the watch face
Bitches stick to me like duct tape
As icy as a damn cupcake
Ya, these hoes feel my feng shui
And I want to eat myself alive, I'm like a main course
Every time I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my fucking thang
And every time I do it, I do my thing
I do my damn thing
Every time I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my fucking thang
And every time I do it, I do my thing
I do my damn thing, you dig
Tilt Santana Scarf
Backseat in the heat, I'm hotter than a quilt
They look at me like they're drinking bad milk
High money: Jack and Jill
As if they were sitting on a hill
Ice on my neck, ice on my wrist
Ice in both hands bitch, I'm lit up like a Christmas tree
Different colored stones that you could call a mystery
Big dookie rope, you would think I was being lynched
I feel sorry for the fool the day he tries to get with me
Fresh prince, he has benches like Hilary
I make the girls run fast like Benny Hill
The tires go round and round, you can call them my wheels of fortune
I don't play, I throw it like Halo
You have more paper than your work has payroll
I'm still a ghetto with no frills
I clean the dirt from my nails 100 dollar bills
Why
Every time I do it, I do my thang
And every time I do it, I do my thing
Every time I do it, I do my thang
Do my thang, my fucking thang
And every time I do it, I do my thing
I do my damn thing, you dig
Maine, dizzy raw ...
Because I don't move it, I just run it (I run it)
Steppin in this live motherfucker than a concert
No these are not converts
I did it behind a trick
I line them up, knock them down
Ambulance rack em up
Body bag pack em up
Bloody white sheets
It means assaulting your friend
Tellin niggas friend
I catch them as they snuggle
When the gun goes nuk uk uk
Run in your crib
Now she likes it but but but
I'm not trying to hit that shit
There is no one innocent
I don't want to hear the shit
I have it with the mint pillow
Know who you're dealing with, a hand full of aces, me
And this here is where the shit
Short, NAHMEAN
You couldn't see me with some high lights
Hears
(Chorus: x2)
Don't say it nigga, don't do it
Because I don't move it, I just run it (I run it)
Don't say it nigga, don't do it
I don't because I did (I did)
I rush to lotta bread
Yes
I'm a rapper but not a writer
Because i do it in my head
Look how I make fun of the feds
Pink Yellow Blue Diamonds Got My Piece
Mack maine tried to teach me how to count bars
I stack chains which is what keeps me out of police cars
My rap name carries weight like a fat broad
My gat game told you niggas in (?)
I'm so crazy when I do it
It's the same Mack Maine I distribute the fluid
Let it rain in your veins, yeah buddy we could do it
I have some in the trunk and some in the muffler
Paranoid when I look so paranoid that I could
Motherfucker steals from you, so don't be in my rear view
Hears
(Chorus: x2)
Don't say it nigga, don't do it
I don't because I did (I did)
I rush to lotta bread
Don't say it nigga, don't do it
I don't because I did (I did)
I rush to lotta bread
Because I don't move it, I just run it (I run it)
Yes
I'm not kidding, I'm trying to score a hundred of them
Things just to break my block
Glock pulling out my shirt to stop the movement
I saw my cousin explode and focus
Also, sometimes it rains too much, so look where the road is
I hear a lot of shit
I have to drop something but I'm trying to get some shit
I'm still a bully, I say my body is so stiff
Ridin with my batter I feel a little fake for no reason
My main objective is to play as Lamar Odom
And carry cocaine and use this rap shit like a token
The stress made me smoke a jo 'totin a fo' fo 'and
Scopin to kick someone's no
Knowing that I have a little son to take care of
But I'm a fucking swindler being a good kid
Don't say it nigga, don't do it
I don't because I did (I did)
I rush to lotta bread
Because I don't move it, I just run it (I run it)
Don't say it nigga, don't do it
I rush to lotta bread
Look here
S B donks five seven five jeans, five thousand dollars in my damn wallet chain, I'll be a wild man, I'm an island man, there's not much else for me man
I tell them to float and continue with the ozone, I'm not there anymore, my forceful like a pollan, it drags on, and I cling to it like a trambone, I'm so impressed, and um I have that c ** * back I don't need that bone of the Thumb, so come on, you've got the one with the drum on, it's the one that goes away, da da la dit dit dit dit, I'm so cool when I spit, I put my foot on your butt, now I'm kicking your shit, now throwing your bitch, and she catches him with her lip, now she catches him with her mouth, and since I'm the president, she tried to put it on her blouse, I say whoa, easy baby, I'm the real cake, so she eats the baby, what the fuck is getting much crazier, we turn the bitch like I'm in the gym, I'm not fucking those bitches with that stadium, that's not a dome, bitch go home bitch bitch bitch, bitch go home
Bitch, I spent a hundred winters in my snow cone
Lil nigga walking like she's got her bowl on
Bossy, pimp stro pimp stro, and I have to let my money go when the wind blows, I bet it comes back as a rent, and I bet bitches understand me as 10-4, niggas are simple, like instrumentals, I bet on They are bitches, understand me as information, cut your top and cut low
Something like my Benz though
Riding with my friends hoes, I mean my friends hoes, fucking all my friends hoes, taking all my hoes ends, will make that blow turn
I tell these young niggas pimps or they die, don't get that Benz, if you don't divide them, dig them thighs, on them tires
And if you catch up to I, I don't preach the speech and I give you beef with fries
Come to the beach and find, I live where all the sea eagles fly
Look, baby, I'm so high, all I need you to do is shut up and cry, bitch bitch shut up and cry
I'm just the lion and he is the young bull, I don't see the bull, that gun on my hip from which I got a hammy to take out, I had a leg at school, I think it was a red devil, I'm TI Red, I'm TI Red, DI Ed, for what you said
So flying tattooed my wings, the gun stuck to me, but I hit you in the stomach, now I have yesterday's food on me, that was very rude.
And I smell a marijuana plant, young son of a bitch for money where cheese
And when we get to the club
All bitches know our names
And when we leave the club, everyone knows we came
Because all the ugly bitches stayed in the rain
And when we get to the club
All bitches know our names
It's Curren $ y, Weezy F Baby, Mack Maine
And when we leave the club, everyone knows we came
Because all the ugly bitches stayed in the rain
I'm that nigga, the nigga nigga
The nigga nigga
The arrogance of glass shit in my basement like Tigger
But mom is not cooking shit
I have my mom sucking bricks
I am connected with
Those bitches, who you'll be connected to
Bitches, who can connect me
Those niggas that can hook me, when they get along with them, I send them my hittas to get them.
A gun to your face and that's all you can think of?
I'm wilder than a young dick in some bitch, little niggas
I'm here, you don't come
You niggas just fuck
I'll be a puffin the pound
By myself, I don't need anyone else
I need help, shit
I leave you puppies in your bitch from my D&G belt
Hot boy in your mouth I melt
And when we get to the club
All bitches know our names
And when we leave the club, everyone knows we came
Because all the ugly bitches stayed in the rain
And when we get to the club
All bitches know our names
It's Curren $ y, Weezy F Baby, Mack Maine
And when we leave the club, everyone knows we came
With my hand on your puller, I turn them black again
I got something for them niggas who react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back
Woah
She says "I know you haven't had a nice thick bitch in a minute
I saw some pictures of you booed, it seems that you are starting to like skinny "
I say "Girl, you're a trip", she says "It could be a trip, but I'm not stumbling"
She says "Look at these hoes, because they are leeches like Robin" I say, "No, Robin Givens"
I was sitting on my lap and you know a nigger is tied I know he feels it
It's crazy out here, I'm just protecting myself, you know I'm winning
She says "I get it, and if something happened to you, I'd be furious"
"You don't have to worry about that, I will kill a black man, I will put his head on display"
Disappear, think they caught a big fish until its body dripped out
I treat her legs like a big opening, smiling as I cut the ribbon.
I took a pill, she took a pill, we were getting cold, 20 minutes, now we're sorry
I said, "It never goes out of style, I thought I would never say never, but I did
I admit it, big booty, big boobs; I admit it
I got something for them niggas who react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back
I like my girls bbw
The guy who wants to dry you
Then have lunch with you
She about that nonsense, about that problem, too
Bubble Booty, Tits So Fucked
I saw a movie of yours boo'd, boy, you never liked skinny guys
You tell me I'm a journey, well it could be a journey, but I'm not stumbling
Stop acting like you don't have any kind
Who are you kidding?
I admit it, I admit it
But now I have these weapons on me
I have these drugs on me right now
I have two buyers, I want it right now
She took off her clothes and I stopped
I looked at my watch, like "Fuck it, why not?"
I guess I could fuck her once, so I'm out
Fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord
She says, "I know you thought you were about to get a quick fix, go on, go on
But you know you haven't been with a nice thick chick in a minute. "
I say, "You never lie; I thought I would never say never, but I did."
She said "Speaking of a line, are you finished? All we need is a witness"
"Girl, you're stumbling, the young black man still lives"
She said, "Who are you kidding, boy? You like a thick bitch, big booty, big boobs."
I admit it, I like a thick bitch, a big booty, big tits; I admit it
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit on your lap
With my hand on your puller, I turn them black again
I got something for them niggas who react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back
I like my girls bbw
The guy who wants to dry you
She about that nonsense, about that problem, too
Bubble Booty, Tits So Fucked
Lil Wayne: yes
Juelz Santana: uhh uhh uhh uhh
Lil Wayne: yes
Juelz Santana: I can't feel my face, yeah, I make the sound so beautiful, you did
When the levees broke
When planes collide
What's up on my nigga
You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers.
We keep our heads up after the disaster
When the levees broke
What's up in my nigga, the same shit?
After Katrina, after the towers.
We keep our heads up after the disaster
They couldn't kill me holla if you feel me
911 survivor, yeah I feel you
Damn, buildings on fire, on fire
They couldn't bear the heat, so they jumped
A deck of cards without aces: luck is gone
Now they all screwed up like loose nails
I'm like what we should do with a home without a roof
God yes now just look in your seat
Blacks, whites, all covered in rubble, yeah
When the levees broke
When planes collide
You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers.
We keep our heads up after the disaster
When the levees broke
When planes collide
What's up in my nigga, the same shit?
After Katrina, after the towers.
We keep our heads up after the disaster
Try to keep your head up and not get fed up (no)
But it seems that they will not let us live.
Yes, and they told me that life is not shit and neither is this world
That's why I scream fuck the world, not the people (no)
People swallow like meat, eat
And your president was lying while my people died
Help! SOS, someone save us
Ten dead inside, where our savior
I hate being at my lowest point, so I choose to get high
High, so high, that my name should be heaven
It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's me
I am the father of New Orleans and I am a family man
When planes collide
What's up on my nigga
We keep our heads up after the disaster
When planes collide
After Katrina, after the towers.
We keep our heads up after the disaster
Take care of the Jewish Jew and his mother (please)
Take care of little Jah (please)
Take care of all the children (please)
Yes sir please keep your eyes on me
And if I die, I pray for my soul that you keep
And I don't want this world to kill me, but I'm weakening
I can't take much longer, I just want to be free
Free, they said they knew there was a problem with the levees, and they did nothing (nothing)
Clinton approved the money and Bush did nothing (nothing)
I feel like what's really going on
Airplanes in buildings, what's next King Kong?
I wish we didn't have a reason for this song (but we do) Moment of silence for the people who left (Shhhhh)
For those who remain in peace, those dead and deceased, we will soon meet again (soon)
I'll see you at the crossroads
Lord please keep your eyes on me
I can't take much more, I just want to be free
When the levees broke
When planes collide
You know the same shit
After Katrina, after the towers.
We keep our heads up after the disaster
When the levees broke
When planes collide
What's up in my nigga, the same shit?
After Katrina, after the towers.
Rolling chunky, a little annoyed on the streets where niggas look at me
If you are hatching, I will appear in your head
I'm a Hollygrove problem, like "Follow me, yeah
Why i'm here i come to scratch
I've already been to jail twice and told them I'll never come back, huh?
He went through the city with the metal on his back, huh?
He gave me a chance and I sent several of them back, huh?
He gave me some money, they'll never get it back now
A million, two million, three million: now I'm stacked
No more crack now, it's in the back for now
Just in case she takes action
I never back off, bitch shit, I could react now
Where are you in clown I'm high in the sky
I make a nigger hide that pride
I don't have time for you bitches, I'm trying to get these riches
Real niggas know that vision
It's not time for you haters, I'm trying to get this role
True ladies know that childbirth
I don't have time for you snitches, I'm trying to get riches
Real niggas know that vision
Motherfuckers, you know what I'm doing here
And you don't have to buy it, if you don't like it
Influenced drug block, pale blue light, scream
Looking for the boy, the one behind
I could get your stomach off your back
I could make you shit better, this better, than what they sell
Yes i am him yes yes
Hip-hip, hoo-ray, 20 were hard today
And two big ones were the pay, and the Coast Guard said it was okay
Bring them to the bay
And my bitch looks like a DeBarge, so I call her bait
She put packages in her bra and the keys in the case
If you ever try to skate with the cake and move
I got your social life and your date of birth, bitch please
I speak like a swindler, I walk like a swindler
Stripper attitude, only money makes me move
Dapper dan status, I'm the stunner part two
I have an image to keep, and my image too.
I'm off the scrimmage line like Emmitt 2-2
I have a hundred bags and a hundred women; French touch
And we don't even speak, we only kiss in French, it could never be pinched
Mom only dated scammers, so I could only congratulate them
And never roll with a doll on your hip
Make the judge give you a sentence
Never that, I keep the gun for that business
And when I'm not, I'm in business
Look, that's a crazy business, look at the simplifications
It's cash, nigga, just live it
I am the real, the authentic, the fact and the truth
It's Jae Millz, dark skin, but I'm black in the cabin.
And for green or that white, you will see red
So your butt is dead, you don't need a hospital room or a bed
Just tell your mom to bring you some pretty threads
So at least he'll be an idiot, nigaa dying of style
He didn't want to look at me now, he had to look down
Someone better tell them about these rhythms that I'm a beast
Half man, half animal as King in Tekken
I'll tear it apart, hell yeah Young Money is what I'm repeating
No speed limits so you can get there in a minute
It is Dedication 3, there is no replacement for us
It's like asking a group of Muslims where that bacon is
And that amnesia is my medication
That's Amsterdam grade A, I'm smoking in the Netherlands
So high I probably never land, bitch
Muthafuckin 'psychopath
Young Money cavemen, muthafuck an advertisement for Geico
Shit on you bitches now let me flush the toilet and clean my ass
Bitch I'm playing I like my cash no I'm lying I love my dough
I've got hoes falling like a hundred million dominoes
But not like pizza, like pussy
When I wouldn't
Holla in ya guala, yeah, bitch, it's me
Taking muthafuckas out of the kitchen heat
I'll put you where the fish sleep
And when they wake up, you'll be the fish party
Yes, I am a shark, you see my fin, ho?
The bullet leaves a hole in your face, not a dimple
Directly from N.O., no problem
To put a black brain in the muthafuckin 'window
Ugh, damn it, I'm nasty
Leather guts and could add
These crazy niggas that are so arrogant
Yes, and call me Mr. Swag-more
I have a girlfriend open like damn pores
Or open like damn doors
Nigga, it's fuck you and I'm fucking yours
From the bedroom to the floors
Whores ha!
Because the police are looking at the streets, they are talking
Already hoes is unfaithful, your family is not great
Niggas ain't loyal ya, niggas ain't lawyers
And everyone saw you and she's not a bitch!
And this here is the Carter, oh! me! And this is the Carter me! Oh!
This is just to clarify the fact that I'm a damn mack
This is just to verify the fact that I have straps on my back
Elegant as I want to be born to be hustla, I'll be rich until I'm gone
I'm going to keep spitting this shit for the hustlaz, I'm going to keep living this shit, I'm ruthless
I bet I'll reap this when I'm gone defeat this while I'm here
I'm gonna keep hitting this street shit in your ear

My shit beat every jeep on every street this year
Wizzle F Baby, you all niggas can have the Weezy
I'm the Birdman Jr. junior
I'm a man for another man for a bitch I'm a pimp in the whip I'm a hundred thousand
And in the streets I am a man of money
And I hunt it with the streets, I get money on the streets like a hundred men
A hundred tests in my other hand
Because the police are looking at the streets, they are talking
Already hoes is unfaithful, your family is not great
Niggas ain't loyal ya, niggas ain't lawyers
And everyone saw you and she's not a bitch
Niggas ain't loyal ya, niggas ain't lawyers
And everyone saw you and she's not a bitch
Now all the bitches have me walking with my cock in hand
And these niggas rolled me with my clip on my hip
But this is my land, so the puncture doesn't stumble because K doesn't get stuck and a nigger doesn't get lost
They tell me I'm shit like a nigga, don't me
But nigga ain't slipping 'cause I'll kill a punk bitch Word Up!
I leave you bitches, money and drugs, nigga
Three for you wisdom five more for you mug nigga
How many more do you love nigga?
Because I have so much more to give, I have never been a spokesperson
Ask him reverend about me, I'm the young God
Aim the shotgun at your frame and boy bust
Brain and guts drip down the drain and such spills
Sure yuk a fucking boy. Damn boy!
The technological heat, son of an ass, put your damn chest under your son
Blooka blook blap bleep ya ass son (laughs)
Nigga tries to see her grandson and us
Got niggas in the yard trying to see me with a Grammy
Couldn't see me even if you were standing with me
I am so damned convincing, not invisible, that man is invincible
And it advances a little because of the pine
My niggas call me Little Russell Crowe for my beautiful mind
And I let you do the time that I do the crime
When the crowd yells my name, I bring my team to the line
Nigga that's S.Q. and well nigga that's S.Q. and firrin Nigga!
Got Streets in the building Gotti in the building
KL, Fee Fee in the building in Rome, DI, Ceeti ...
I'm that black Dominican, your bitch is talking about
I'm in a different city, you can fuck her now
I have a complete collection of my collection ho
I said, "Fuck all you niggas except my niggas"
Security doesn't check my niggas, all of you niggas gonna respect my niggas
Either that or a blow or a bat to the nape of my nigga
Yes, that little one with all of you, because he never knew a big dog until he met my niggas
I have a big dream, of a small town
Old hoes thinking I'm gonna put them on now
Room full of bad bitches, I'm gonna put them all
I have never had change, why change now?
Until they heard me spit, now everything is strong
I have a mojo, with a flow of flow
I have a full charge, I don't know if it's a promotion
Coolin 'on the cut with a bud drinking blunt
There's no love for the po-po
Gotta pour more for my niggas in hell
However, never say that I'm going to need a little more drug for my uncle.
Because I sell flows and he sells drugs, black work
Yes euro
What about this fortune teller Mack?
The nigga who put them all in Miley Cyrus
Negrodamus my black
Predict futures
You need some lottery numbers holla me nigga i got you
Put a nigga in that long hearse and K no girl
Word to Martin, I'm cold with these homer shots
As Pam makes a nigger say, "Damn Gina"
Millzy! Money doesn't mean anything, my youth
I'll kill you for some slippers
This dedication 5, no vacation slime
We in the final zone and they in the stands
Cheerleaders, we're not worried about anything, nothing
Nigga act dumb, hit the button, fuck 'em up
Get them out of here as the sixth foul in the NBA
Little nigga without discussion
Boy I'll close your case, like Judge Millz Lane
All of you crazy ass niggas stay out of Millz lane
Large weapons that go over the dog's shoulder
My team tied up, no overalls
So please don't make me do it, I have soldiers and shooters
These bullets will be swallowed like Kahlua shots
When we light the grass, we fly like a rumor
Then get on the plane and fly over your losers
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer
I'm not from this time that resists on computers
Look boy if it's war then we all come after you
Shots on your challenger, shots on your passenger
Jae Millz is not worried about anything
Young Money is not worried about anything
We are not worried about anything (Young Money)
Nigga, we ain't worried about a thing (Jae Millz)
Nigga, we ain't worried about nothing (nothing)
That's jazzy right there
Yes oh wait oh
(It's Gangstra Grillz, you bastards!)
Yes hot spitta
Yeah chick thief
YM, young and sexy
I just can't help this fetish that we got, from the fucking hoes of other niggas
They recognize us wherever we go
So it's easy for us to get them out of their clothes
You only respect the fact that we're the niggas she chose
So we go with her and you will go alone
Since I'm the best, I walk with additional gestures
Lead on my hip for textbook testers
Write me with a pen and put your name at the end
I will invite you and a friend to a game, and I don't play.
But would I swear I hit the game when it's off?
The seats don't fold, baby, this is the floor
Ugh, baby, this is the boy
She says the baby
I'm a young macaroni and cheese
My Belize girl, she never wants to believe
I'm a rapper, she would rather think that I'm handsome and sweet
I love how I get sick when I get to the real street
Like Bushwick Bill bitch give me three feet
I'm so Hollygrove mom, I hope you feel my gangsta
And if you do, I don't blame you
I just can't help this fetish that we got, from the fucking hoes of other niggas
They recognize us wherever we go
So it's easy for us to get them out of their clothes
Come on friend, you know how it goes
We are just a group of young black people with mass
So we go with her and you will go alone
Young black money
This is a dedication! (Gangsta Grillz)
Rest in peace Soulja Slim
i woke up in the morning
Kneel down and thank God
I didn't wake up today with a woman by my side
I didn't wake up yesterday with a woman by my side
Neither the day before nor the day before.
And I know that I miss you
Since you left, I've been alone
But it's only steroids, because it made me strong
Girl, hurr gone in the wind
Baby, that's a sin
But i can't give you
Another chance, ma, you're in my rear view
And I put that ring on your finger
Was all inside
But now it's just a symbol of what could have been
Dammit
And now I'm alone, but (I like it)
Damn she left me alone but (I like it)
It's something about Hot Boyz you don't know
I have to love for them that I don't show
AND B.G. been my nigga from the front door
Fa sho '
And I and Juve never get along
But you'd still let your nigga come listen to your sexiest song
Damn I fuck you for that
I fuck you Lil Wack
When you see a real nigga you got to bow
And since I'm a real black, I do exactly that
I had my own lawyer working on the Turk case
After listening to it dissipate in the mixtape
He has so much more to worry about than I do
I'm not stumbling
You all niggas left me alone, but I can't face (I like it)
And then now
I have become the president of the place where I was left in
Much has changed, but I can't source (I like it)
Uh, too many handshakes given
Too many prayers for forgiveness
Too many smiles when you hurt yourself
Too many thoughts on your mind
All the time, I made you nervous
And you always read your horoscope
Tryna imagine if the nigga you're talking to him
And your friends say no, the dealer says no
But fuck it, you have a body that will pay the car grade
Thirty percent down payment
Take the girl off the lot, now you're famous
You're alone and you're fine
Every check wants to buy you time
Because when you feel it you kill it
Your pride is gone now, you will
Even tell a stranger
All of you for the feeling
Yes everyone for the feeling
And you never walked away from that feeling
Take a breath and say something
Go ahead talk about it
Money on discussion
Make something out of nothing
And all these promises, all bluff
Water the seed until the soil is muddy
Uh, and all the vacations you work
And when I have time you will be at work
Damn I guess you're looking for something better
But I'm digging in that pussy like I'm looking for treasure
And the feeling doesn't die if you don't leave it, but you don't leave it
So I give you credit, and today is my lucky day.
Today she does nothing, so when we meet
I put it in her stomach she says
Sorry tunechi
She feels it when I kill him
Her pride was gone now that she was ready
That everything is for the feeling
Say it's all about the feeling
Yeah all of you for the feeling
All of you for the feeling
And you never walked away from that feeling
Take a breath and say something
Go ahead, talk about the weeks
Talk about the months, talk about the pussy niggas
Man they're all punks, they live for the moment
No gray hair, nothing worries you
And never let that go
Even tell a stranger
Yeah all of you for the feeling
Yes everyone for the feeling
God willing
You never stray from that feeling
Yes everyone for the feeling
Keep your head on the ceiling
Kill it when you feel it
Because all of you because of the feeling
Take a breath and say something
Girl let's talk about it
MMM yes
But you don't have to say anything
They asked me why I did it.
And I told them it was all about the feeling

Ooh boy (yeah!)
We are about to pray for all our loved ones.
Anyone you lost, put them in your heart
I hope you're not too tired to cry
And I hope you know
You're never too alive to die, heh
Listen, I grew up where people call them people on us
I lost some friends, and the pain still affects us
So we have their names written on us
Whites still spit on us
And they bit the teeth of the K9 police still clenching on us
But we smoke, the ashes still come to us
The older bitches still beat us
I remember well, Beezy rolled an L
Beezy is not here. Where is Beezy? Beezy was killed
But I know that it happened, my nigga
Shit is so much deeper than this rappin ', my nigga
But now they all rap, my niggas
So now I must make it happen
So I'm going to play the captain, the fluttering sailboat, my nigga
Happy for my nigga Lil Tagus
Because even though we couldn't, the Lord saved him
The last time we saw him was when Katrina hated
Shit, he found her body like a month later
Rest in peace boy
He was a boy from the east, and so was Wessy West
He was a good nigga so I know he blessed
And her daughter is a princess
And I swear I have a lump in my throat
But I'm going to keep pumping the flow
So if I cry, don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart stopped a beat
My nigga Lil Derek rushed to copy a ki
Either that, or load the gat and pop a G
I pray that your family and mom are well
I think about it all the time, I drink it all the time
I smoke back to back
Because if my thoughts affected me, I'd be in this rap
Or I'd be in a can
Thank God I had dreams of being the man
Because he's not shit for a man on the edge
He shot him face down on the grass.
Not to mention, with the handcuffs on
And the complaint continues
But nobody does anything about it
The jail and morgue are too crowded
And hate is at its highest point
Everyone has to hate, it's like a damn iPod
Shit, and they tried to burn my Ghost
But I got my gun license, haha, I got my hammers
Because if they don't kill me, I'm going to kill this summer
Yes and you can put that on my late father
Yeah he could hit me with a little money to brag
But black would still not be a father to me.
But look how I finished, I hope you are happy for me
But that's why when I see it, I act like a joker
Because he is a joke to me
Don't send messages, don't call, don't talk to me
It's just me and my mom, how is it supposed to be
And I make sure you paid as if you had written for me
And I know that she gets all hope from me
And I never want to see her depressed for me
There is a day that corresponds to me
But we will pray that it is as far away as the future sees
You are listening to the future Weezy F. Baby
Amen

‘Because my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; fuck a copper
I got the Maserati dancing on the bridge, poppin '
Say to the cops: "Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him "
I follow the goon rules: if you can't beat them, then you resell them
You can't handle them, so you mop them
You can't bear them, then you drop them
You exploit them because we exploit them like Orville Redenbacher

"It was never my intention to desecrate the flag of the United States of America. I was filming a video for a song from my album titled" God Bless Amerika. "The clip that appeared on the Internet was a camera trick clip that revealed that behind of the American flag was Hoods of America. In the final edition of the video, you will see the flag fall to reveal what is behind, but you will never see it on the ground. In most people, including mine, who grew up in In that environment, Hood is the only America they know and the only America I knew when I grew up. I was lucky that God gave me talents to escape Hood and see the other beautiful places this country has to offer, but most of the people born in that country the environment doesn't have that opportunity. That's their vision of their America. That was Dwayne M Carter from Hollygrove New Orleans seen from America. That's what I'm talking about in this song. "

I have some hungry lawyers
That will eat and bite her
I don't know how you love her
I wish I had never met her
She just gave me brains
She was just another tutor
She blew my whole band
I was just another tuba
Now get off my dick

Look, we don't have much in common, so we don't talk as much
Sometimes it feels so uncomfortable
She said why didn't you ask me; I said, "Damn it, I didn't think I had to."
Then she took off the towel and I-I took off my blouse
I tell her that pussy for me, in case she thought it was ours
And she says great
And if you like I love it
If she likes it I love it
Look, we don't have much in common, so we don't talk as much
She has a vagina piercing, a skirt with nothing underneath
And she says when she doesn't see me she feels like Stevie Wonder
If you want that bag, skirt, shirt "
She Made Me Cum 100 Times
Man she got that job, job, job
I tell you my bitch now, I call you first
And then he made her cum 100 times
She's a little green but I'm colorblind
Look, we don't have much in common, so we don't talk as much
She watches me shower, I asked her why she didn't join me
Then she took off the towel and I-I took off my blouse
I tell her that pussy for me, in case she thought it was ours
And she says great
Uh i like that shit
And she bites her lip when she likes that dick
Fucking with you, well, I need another shower
I need another shower
Can you help me take another shower?
Then we'll make each other scream
She can get her hair wet because it's her real hair
I'm like, "Hell Yeah"
And she says "fucking good"
And she says I can pull it, because it's her real hair
It was then when I said: "Work, work, work
If you want that bag, skirt, shirt "
And she made me run 100 times
She Made Me Cum 100 Times
I tell you my bitch now, I call you first
And then he made her cum 100 times
She's a little green but I'm colorblind
So I said, "Look, we don't have much in common
Sometimes it feels so uncomfortable. "
Let me explain the difference between you and me
Stop like it's ragged rock [? ]
Yeah you're just an ordinary nigga
Here is the difference man I run with the mills, blacks can't eat, I'm not done with food
Look at the niggas who are smiling men having fun
"Pharrell, you are a great black. Let me shake your hand. You wear tight pants, you wear black bands, you wear long trucks, cradle in the sky and
Nigga, you're a perjuror, you lie in court nigga
You are verbose snitchhy snitchy and proly bitchy bitchy
Riding through Hileah, ride through Kendall
Tour Carol City, tour Overtown
Where they leave that ass on the floor
But you say they know you now
But the difference is that when they see you, will they hold you up?
See P grew up with a heroin pedal?
They made fun of me because I was a strange guy
Look, I was half skate park, I was half ghetto
But you cut me and then you saw my bones made of metal
Here's my DNA, yeah it was essential
Unlike your aftermarket Roley Presidential
Look at my Audemars, three hundred something
Barack inspired (why?) The next black

And now we are at the top so we own for photos
Why is our money longer than bitches' noses?
And, and for my shows, do you know what I'm getting?
Like a mansion every night, it's fair to say that I make a living
And hip hop never closed, it just wasn't safe to visit
But I reopened it, I'm about to break the tape
I see it and I'm inside I do it as you dreamed it
Silly ice game than O.J. Simpson
I travel next year I check the numbers on the temperatures and

Cut all my exes, higher than cholesterol
I tried to be a teacher and the bitch took a semester
Wishing for a superstar, trippy life is too strange
When this Loius Vuitton huffs and holds the new seats
Life in vivid color, she in which I pass the blues
And it's right where you belong, girl, he makes you Uber at home
When he calls, she threw down the phone, I just cut the music
Waiting for some Dominos, listening to some Commodores
She said "I love you Tunechi"
I said that I love myself too
She said "What are you doing Tunechi?"
I said, "That is up to you."
She said "I don't want much Tunechi"

And her best friend is a lesbian and I want more love, yes
I've been fucking around in legend, Michael Jackson, Jesse
Lil Tunechi, Elvis Presley, Hendrix, Future, past or present, yes
I'm too hot for television, too high for my exes, I'm triple x rated
Too many drugs, sex and weapons, yeah

I make it look good, I make it look easy

Now bring that big butt here and come do what we do
Pick up the boy, suck my dick and try to kiss it

Skateboarding these days is amazing. Umm, new tricks I've got. Umm, you guys really don't know anything about that shit. When I say "you", umm, I don't mean any of my fans, I don't mean people who don't skate, I don't mean people who do skate. It's just a lil, you know what I mean, it's a skate thing. You meet a skater, he, he or she, they will meet you and let you know what I mean. We always think they don't know what the hell we're talking about. But, do you see how I put myself in that "we", as if I were a real skater? However, everything is fine, yell at my skaters!
Junkie
Dope man, coke man
Yes
I have a driver for my limousine
Yes he likes to talk
She likes to talk
So when he leaves her
They have a heart to heart
I guess you got all the answers
And I have all the verses
My Benzo has no roofs
But the windows came with curtains.
G and I strayed
Showing up these Percs like he's in injury reserve
And when the pockets are fluff, we want that fluff to be fur
No baking soda, my nigga, we play it raw
I want you to know that I am black, without a mask
Cut your tongue, put that bitch in a glass jar
Then leave it in your child's classroom
Bags of earth, we belong to the void
Long corridors, my room is the last room
Long and hard days, my schedule has no space
You're at home all day, you're stuck on your MacBook
I've been gone all day, I'm chasing that checkbook
And on the day that we were in section eight
Now we're in our own section, motherfucker like "Ayy"
Public enemy number one as Flav
Fifteen with a mouthful of gilt like Flav
Fifteen with a house full of hoes like Hef
The shots take off like a stealth
Letting human heads replace the Grammys on the shelf
Put a bitch head right under the belt until I burp
And she will not receive a dollar; zero zero
Tunechi passes the forceful, I will need time to study
They don't know who has the gun
But they know who received the money.
We don't want to know what happens
What do these bitches want from me?
Bitches saying I'm a dog
But these bitches want puppies
My bitches bring others
My bitches bring gums
Your bitches burn gums
Your bitches burn dinner
I'm still important and I made you niggas
You're going bodily for a black skater
I'm not the kind of black Skypin's bitches are
I scream at all my bitches one night niggas
Woah, be sure to hit them with Slut Walk
And I spill another, another
Chewing gum flavored cream soda
Woah, straying straight from these niggas
From Collins to Highland to Bourbon on these niggas
Those other niggas just didn't deserve me niggas
No more family matters, no more Urkel about them niggas
I feel like a virgin born back to them niggas
I'm running to the bank, fast like Herchel on them niggas
What is in your wallet?
I did commercial on them niggas
By the way about them niggas
When we see you, boy, the shots will come again
Long hair, I don't care, black; Cactus jack
No roofs
I keep the blammer in the drawer with my pajamas
I keep the ammunition in the bananas
I treat randoms like some buddies
I got more value than failure
I have more adventures than instinct
I don't dream if I have nothing to wear
I know you believe, I know be careful
I know she's a devil, and this is a matter
If mom is a queen and dad is a bear
You run out of steam, you run out of stairs
I run on Supreme and I get something weird
She ran to the team, and is now a player.
We live on the edge, we die in the air
We are sick in the head, but the pockets are fine
On tiptoe over the eggs, we pop out of our shell
Our vision is red, the eyes too.
We can't pay attention, we have to pay bills
It doesn't make sense if you're not making mills
We don't take photos, we don't take L's
If they love to listen then I hate to say
If you are afraid to visit then I take you there
If heaven is real then all of you are false
Cut off your heels and bounce off your tail
I'm on a mission, survival is real
Man, fuck how I fix it, I admire the repairs
I'm talking about six but my mind is on twelve
Poppin 'recipes on top of the hill
I said to that nigga, stay out of my hair
She just wants to fuck on the throne
The shit gets too deep and they dug up your bones
She sniffs that King and mixes it with Kong
Her clit has a ring, and my cock has a horn
This is what I call risk and reward.
We cut it close, we give the ninja the sword
This shit is sick and enters your pores
And then you're a corpse, and then it's the morgue
I'm in a hurry until it's Forbes
I swore it was just a chore
The house by the water, condo by the shore
I'm sure, I'm all about that manure
Cooler than leather and warm like velvet
I'm not the only one, when it's war
And I have your tongue, stomp once
Then smile at your young man, see that I'm having fun
Shit, don't go crazy until I say go crazy
Run to your shelter and explode in your nose
Your baby will take me straight to the basement
Gun to the head, she gets down to basics
Without dramatization, we pop these indicators
Behind despair, it is in our nature.
Cold-hearted, perspiration turns to glaciers
Cheers, better be loud and bodacious
And then I'm going to take a bow and be nice
Throw it into the crowd and then take power in the spacious
I'm out of my mazes, I'm out of my cages
I'm off the labels, I'm a little escapist
I benefit, praise it, spend it, keep it
I buy a nation, you rent from Avis
I'm in, sorry, I did it, you said it
You're killing, you're playing, I'm friendly, I'm faded
I get too high to get through the hiatus
You look into my eyes and my pupils dilate
I am faithful to my qualifications, I am stuck to my statements
I just want to dive into the group of my payments
You're running your mouth, seeing how fast you can chase it
The stick is malicious, equipped with a laser.
The temperature is burning, the tension is rising
You smell the dead once, you gotta live with the fragrance
The disease is real, the drugs are too tasty.
Keeping it dirty like Sanford and Grady
The Young Mula Baby, I'm back from the 80s
Dedication, sick, shit
My favorite movie quote is "Do you have 14 bricks in that bag right there?" That is my favorite movie quote. It was with Cam talking, you know, Mitch and all of them, that was, damn, I always forget the name of the movie and it's my favorite quote, but it's not my favorite movie, but that's my favorite quote. My favorite movie, if you wanted to know, if I ever said it, I never said it, it's Sixth Sense, so don't ask me why, I see dead people, you know what I mean, so I ran away from them dead bitches
Yes, drought 3, yes
Bitch, I'm back in my dingy Young Money, where are you?
Two tables and a microphone, tell the DJ to run it
Bitch, I'm back in my dingy Young Money, where are you?
Two tables and a microphone, tell the DJ to run it, bi-bi-
Cut me G, cut the music baby
Bitch, I'm back in my grizzy, Young Money, where are you?
If you fuck Young Money, Young Money, where are you?
Boy that helicopter keeps drumming like brrrat-at-at-tat
But I'm a giant, like "Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum"
I just bought a new crib inside Sodom
I have some money saved in case the hurricane hits
I'm a damn shame, huh? Yeah i know yeah i know
I leave the country to look for all my clothes and my hoes
I go out of my way just to get my dro and my dough
Cause I love him more than I love my hoes, yes I do
I have gasoline coming out of my pores, I am a torch
I got glasses like white boy Scott Storch and a Porsche
I have a license for scorched, snipers on your porch
Rifles for the forts and we shoot the courts
I'm an Eastern Blood and I don't smoke that Crip
I smoke that Kush, first name Bubba
First name Young, last name Stunna
Smooth as a cruise ship floats when I walk
I brag because I'm playing, I'm supposed to be playing
When I'm on the phone with bitches, man, the money keeps calling
You are not satisfied until your son calls you
OK, you want a zombie movie
That's when you come into your house and everyone dies
Yeah I could take shit where I'm standing, where I'm standing
You're not a man, you're a ho, I could kill him with the current
And then he plays the guitar at the fucking funeral
Big guns, so they drink big shots
Koreans call me Wayne Chang, now listen ma
You niggas suck like Tony Romo, not homo
And it's all about my money, I get paid for the promotion
Yeah i'm this bitch's man
They say money talks, well I'm the ventriloquist
And if I ever jump, I'll probably land on your bitch
Boy that's colder than my hand and my wrist
Boy I'm cooler than a fan and a mint
And when you finish this track you will need a couple of bandages
I'm with savages and I'm above average
I'm a crazy star like a fucking asterisk
You niggas can't see me, I'm on my shit Casper
Running so much game, I'm gonna fuck and scold a bitch
And you know I'm going to score as Deion after the picks
I'm taking a pill, she takes that morning after the dick
I showed up and took some pictures of Patron
I showed up and took some pictures of Gray Goose
Pop-popped, yeah
Young money, bitch and if you niggas wanna do it
We blow up cops, and there are no rats in my block, I have a store
I have that dro, I have pills, I have that yay
Young money, bitch
Drought 3, on your neck, pussy
It's like an Adam's apple, nigga
Weezy Baby, the God, Amen, is gone
Beep beep, beep beep, beep beeeeep
Yeah I woke up to niggas that sounded to me damn
I smoked one and went back to sleep, okay
These rappers need some law and order, Ice T, damn
They can't touch you Tunechi, Poison Ivy, man
I roll up, I'm smoking like hot tea, yeah
I woke up and couldn't believe I slept, damn
You woke up and then you try to live the dream
But before you check yourself, check my history
I've never been a storm buyer, or just a fly in the wallpaper
I've never been a tailgater, I've always been a bail maker
If you don't understand shit now
You'll love hating the smell later
I tell him to wait, your photos don't appeal to me
She told me to stop, and then she heard a slight screech, yeah
She has a black heart, telling white lies through her white teeth
Black eyes always try to fight sleep
He met his wife, she said: "Tunechi, my wife"
Hi, I'm so spicy, I made her sweat like Keith
Although our time is short, she will be on me like underpants
Ethika, Ethika, Ethika
Heffanie calls me Hefner
F-ing her all in her exiter
If he sends a message, I'm killing the messenger
Everyone hails death in America
Your ex will be hating like eczema
That fake nigger as a fighter
Anyway baby I'm feeling you
But that nigga slipped and fell in love with you
These niggas no one for everyone
They play too much and they never win
He got you a room at the Sheraton.
I can get you your own area
Helluva, helluva, helluva
Girl the way you take this D away from me
You act like you spell something
Man, this D bewitched her
I'm deadly like my cell phone
My diamonds sing like Mahalia
You have to make a name
But these niggas fake like an alias
I see no comparison, there are no barbarians
I don't try to book again
Don't fuck around without librarians
She fell asleep in her wet pussy
I woke up in that aquarium, wait
Throw and put my butt back to sleep, ugh
You woke up connected to some IVs
(Bahh!) I am a shooting star
But your bitch made me shoot porn, yeah
Going too far, yeah
I've been trying too hard, yeah
6-6-6
My friendship with Mack Maine is much, much, much, much, much, much more than a friendship. That's my damn brother. I know Mack from the neighborhood, Hollygrove. He had the biggest house in the neighborhood, it was right on the corner. I'm not sure if the whole house was theirs, but it was huge, and he had a great basketball court in his backyard and they all played baseball in his backyard. And umm, since he lived on the corner, like, you can always go relax and play basketball in his backyard and then, like, always be there on the corner in case some shit comes out. Yes, Mack and I have been depressed since the hood. He went to a good school, I didn't go to a very good school, but then we ended up going to the same school, the school is actually called Mack Maine, I know what I mean, and then, umm, he became known for fucking by freestylin 'niggas. You know, I mean, you know, Mack is cold in the routine, I don't know if they call it barbecue or what all that shit they call it, but he's cold right now. He could break your ass, make you cry, make you want to kill him. That kind of shit. He is one of them black, do you know what he is? I'm still laughing in overtime and it actually makes you laugh, but you're still mad, that's one of those niggas. So yeah, when you know how to do it, no, Lord, don't let yourself know how to rhyme and he knew how to rhyme, so he used to kill niggas with that shit, so that's how we really messed with the shit of music . . Shout out my nigga Mack
Now, be the only compass that I need
It's the one that takes you back
It's the one that takes you back
I had cat eyes, nine lives, no brown lines, thighs
She rides me like a ride, I'm real these sci-fi niggas
But that's neither here nor there, she's been contemplating short hair
She said she was trying to be different but she liked the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It will be a sexual war, I will load like software
I have so many hoes that I'm cutting, but she's the only one worth knowing
And yes, dirty, but that's for the flowers to grow
I'm not tripping, but she's tripping
They don't have shit on me, but she keeps sniffing
Look, girl, just give me that brain and I'll return the favor
They say I'm a dog, but why don't I chase them?
I just wanted some time, she said "Ok, I'm your honor"
But she has wanted to break up ever since Dolce and Gabbana
All that ass I'm just saying, "Come sit your shopping at my counter"
I drink tea, she drinks wine, call it Tijuana
I'm dying to meet his girl, but she wants me to meet her mom.
I swear I can go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9 9
The grass is funky, but I'm smelling good, Tunechi!
Now, be the only compass that I need
I put my hat back on
It's the one that takes you back
Now, be the only compass that I need
It's the one that takes you back
I have that shit in my system
Someone is going to be my victim
I have that good-good, that's good
That dawn, that midnight
I hit him like a fist fight, one, two, three, four, five, 6-9
That cock in your windpipe, some of his friends I don't like
But fuck all that, I'm in one, I don't want to be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue, my third leg runs marathons
I feel like I'm blind, girl, can't you see? Who is meant to be
So come to me, then come to me, my game is cold, one degree
I'm shooting with two bad bitches because misery loves company
One sweet, one sour, my bee and my bumblebee
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick without speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, only reaches Lil Tunechi
"Now, be the only compass I need"
Now, be the only compass that I need
It's the one that takes you back "
Should I call someone else?
Because girl it's almost twelve and this cock won't suck on its own
Girl you know you need help, it would be a black day
If you said on your way, huh, huh
Should I call someone else?
Because girl it's almost twelve, and this cock won't suck on its own
Girl you know he needs help he makes a nigga day
I just hope you know the way
And she said
"Now, be the only compass I need"
I'm putting you back
Now, be the only compass that I need
It's the one that takes you back "
You need to reach my baby
But you already have me

The best DJ in the world, Raj Smoove
Sell iron all the time, and you know it
We keep warm with that 504 shit (New Orleans)
(Bridge: Lil Wayne)
And you know I remake the interior like the morgue
Look, go back to the garage on the pig
And you know I remake the interior like the morgue
Look, go back to the garage on the pig
And you know I remake the interior like the morgue
The blue coupe like the ‘do in Marge
Ridin with a bitch prettier than a Debarge
Mommy wants a soldier, baby, I'm a sergeant
Now rub me wrong and fuck my massage
And they are flowers for the dead, better give them a corsage
Yeeaa, big black head
And everything I do, San Diego charge
While you niggas just starve
I'm eating so much that I'm going to screw up and throw up
And, red is the color of my scarf (B is above)
And understand: for a giant, you are a dwarf
My flow faded
I'm so sick all I have to do is cough
We keep warm with that 504 shit (New Orleans)
Sell iron all the time, and you know it
We keep warm with that 504 shit (New Orleans)
Sell iron all the time, and you know it
Bitch I come from the bottom of the map
We love counting batteries, we love to pump
I love to kill the track; me, Wayne, Ronny and Mac
That's Hollygrove shit, yeah
And I'm going to hit you in the ear until you clear it up
Did you hear that? That's my word, and I wanted to say that
Believe me
Straight from the block, back in the game
Now run tell me you heard me rap with Wayne
Yeah I'm going on this bitch, smoking drugs on this bitch (bitch)
I'm leaning on this bitch, we got monsters on this bitch
We are deep in this bitch
We keep warm with that 504 shit (New Orleans)
Sell iron all the time, and you know it
We keep warm with that 504 shit (New Orleans)
I have a thing for them big trucks
Big Thin Bitches With Nice Jug And Big Butts
5, 4 moms with good head and fake tits
Don't let goose and probably act
5, 7 bow legged bitches taking cock
All they really need is like two pickups and 6 blunt
Wake up in the morning, count the money and be brave
She really doesn't know English, so we don't say shit
Mother Nature with paper making a Mack Maine in em
Like, there go 1000, like swoosh
Now shake that butt like you can't
In the 60-inch Hitachi, living like Liberace
Wearing the latest Versace, Shotty and Maseratis
Dodging the paparazzi, AC cold as the heart of the Nazis
Then prepare your grill like it's Hibachi
Word to Cousin Rodney
Shooting until my mother falls out of hand
Already track stars; the gun shot ran
I can kill all of you and all of you bosses
Shotguns, pistols, stronger than a band drum.
Bang-bang-bang-bang, call it heavy metal
I say bang bang, bitch, I make you feel every letter
B-A-N-G, B-A-N-G
G-A-N-G, we spray and then we go
We play when we, no, we play N-E-
WATCH; C.P.R
Doctor Carter, are you sick, boy?
Young Money motherfucker, these guys
Bitch, are you crazy? We are late
Watch Nina, Mac and Tommy have a short message like
I like it (* bang-bang *, * bang-bang *)
Yes, Soulja Boy on the beat
But you can call me Chef Boyardee
Because I'm going to heat this shit up, and I'm going to eat this shit up
Planet Earth is my bathroom, you're under this shit
I step back and drop a bomb, now, Hail Mary
You fairy tale, fairy tale, very fragile
And yeah, we got them hammers, try to hit every nail
Let them sail upriver with that shit
Or leave them face down in the fucking ocean
That shit of "Hello, how are you? I'm at your door"
That, "Aww, no, he has a gun! Oh shit!" shit shit
Okay, it's Young Money, what do you know about that?
The semi-automatic will open your body and rip your soul
And all that shit up front, nigga, I don't know
Even my fight, and don't hesitate
Spazzin 'and blastlin', blastin 'and rat-a-tat-in'
And no, I don't cook, but I mash them like potatoes
I don't give a damn about your money or your fashion
Pine box niggas, no crutches, no molds
No wheelchair, just the two-door black car
Flowers on the side and four wheels to steer
We gorillas in the mist, all of you are Kung-Fu pandas
Sweet as Fantasy, my blood is the same as Bruce Banner's
Hit record on camera, fuck all the antics
They say you don't have to get an authorization from Wayne, that's a downside
Musically, we direct thrillers, call me John Landis
Little black man standing tall like a giraffe
Eat rappers for dinner, my nickname "Hannibal"
Guns for days I show you what this cannon does
Hit, split your damn man in two
I grab the helicopter, South Park, that's how I hold the toy
I'm in the streets one deep, I can hold on
And shit, it's just a seat and I control the throne
Look, bitch, I'm fucking crazy
You see the gun sticking out like Sheneneh's lips
Take care of your lips when you speak
Cause I'm in the grave nigga dripping in your coffin, rest in the urine
In God, dedication 6
In God, dedication 6
In god yes
25 million in a nice big mansion
And, bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and the gold Grammys
I'll just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed coffin
25 million in a mansion, so precious
Bitch be careful when you bring your best friends
Satin sheets, I have no time for mess
That exorcist told me that my wife is possessive
Adderall just so we can be restless
We are fucking everything, all night, no breakfast
Without confessions, without questions, we are both professionals.
Now ride me like an open road, not pedestrian
You bought a car for the bitch
I buy narcos for the bitch
You buy apartments and shit
It's cute i just walked into this bitch
You buy the art for the bitch
You guys argue too often and shit
You always start some shit
Shout out to my friends that I miss
Nino and Tony and Mitch
This is not hearty shit
She wants to come snort all this shit
She wants to go hard with a bitch
She knows that we always forget
And he just saw his little bitch
Tell him they're starving for this
Give me the check, give me the throne
My hair is one minute too long
My bitch looks like Vivica-Berry
Your bitch looks like Rosetta Stone
I made my bitch go find a clone
Fuck together and then alone
When they catch feelings, I'm leaving
I'm whipping the Winnie the Coupe
I'm driving and drinking the soup
Shit made me float in the coupe
While I get to the studio
Pull your bitch, you just called your bitch
Understood "Who is this?" She doesn't know that you exist
She on your Mule shit, that's the truest shit
Make you eat your words, make you chew your shit
Nigga, fuck you and fuck who you are with
Yeah my bitch broke but her loot was fixed
Wait, I just got a Perc, another one for dessert.
I washed it with syrup
I just left planet Earth, I met Captain Kirk
I appear a Perc, I'm crazy, call me Perc Nowitzki
Just call her Lewinsky; blurred, blurred vision
Blrrp— "Hello, who is this?" I just got to the line
I have a bitch in mind, I call her anytime
She is taller, but okay, together we have 6-9
I hit his other line, he said, "What other line?"
She likes "It doesn't matter" and can tell a lie
That's my amazing bitch lil
You got me a spicy bitch
You got me a bossy bitch
I left her for a bossy bitch
I got me a naughty bitch
She sucks balls and stick
I'm about to play golf with the bitch
I'm on mars with the bitch
She fucks with Martians and shit
And yeah, your bitch is going crazy on me
You want a quickie with me
Let's say I wish I had Nicki with me
Let's say I would lick it with me
I wish I wish I had my nigga with me
Bitch you're crabby can't fool me
She said "God, forgive me"
I say "No, I'm busy"
I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 bank accounts
That's something to think about
With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 bitches ready to drink me
Ready to drink, ready to drain
And bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and the gold Grammys
I'll just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed coffin
25 million in a mansion, so precious
Bitch be careful when you bring your best friends
Satin sheets, I have no time for mess
Without confessions, without questions, we are both professionals.
Now he rides like an open road, no pedestrians
(Err!)
Six shit, about God
Dedication 6 in God
Dedication 6 in God
Oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Dedication 6 oh Lord
Yes sir
Dedication 6 yes Lord
I'm just detonating, so I get blatant
More dangerous than Internet datin '
Scoob turned on the cameras, so I had to brag
I will lay your sister, I will beat your brother
Weezy spits snowballs, catch it in your bitch face
Good game, Wayne, man, I deserve a Naismith
Flow of cocaine gangs, drug in the vein flow
I'll just smoke the purple of the rainbow
Stronger than Drano, your boyfriend is lame
And if you stay with him, then everyone in the same boat
Deepwater Carter, fishing for a dollar
You can join the salad, I'm dividing your tomato
Ball because I have to, you will love me in the morning
I told him I'm a king, they other black Prince Charming
He loves to play my microphone, he says there's nothing like playing
Man, I'm in love with your grill, George Foreman
Warning, Young Money is armed
And we can shoot, I got the money
Yes, take that to the bank with you
I put my hat aside as if painting pictures
Smoke weed, talk shit like Lane Kiffin
The whole country in recession, but Wayne different
And I'm a Maybach rider
I haven't driven it once, I have a cool black driver
Don't worry if I'm shooting as long as they don't shoot you
And I'm a beast, I'm a pit bull
They kiss my ass, they take my dick out
I am a beast, I am a great bull
I have my money right, I have my clip full
Yeah it's seven in the morning, nigga
Leave the track, let me enjoy the moment, nigga
Now bring that motherfucker back, cause I'm going in, nigga
And if bitches are worth having, then I bet we have them all
And man I'm so high it's like an eternal fall
And I'm carrying these hoes like women's basketball
Uh, I bet the helicopter has its right mind
Leaves a hole in his chest like a lion bite
Superhero car, like I was fighting crime
Uh, the streets T keep rolling with me
Do you need the beaten man? We are those hitmen
He stopped running, bullet holes don't
Uh basically I'm still a monster
Until the fat one sings, I come to kill an opera
All of you too simple, I'm a helicopter
I'm a jerk, wipe me, bitch
I get big checks, Niketown, bitch
Yeah bad cup shit bobby brown
Uh, T, I can't stop going
Drop my best shit, like the Cowboys dropped Owens
I'm the best at doing it motherfucker I know
No roofs, damn it, now the damn sky is showing up, huh
Holla on your boy, it's Weezy Baby
They label me as a problem
And I probably am, so I don't touch them
I appear on a broccoli Lam 'in helicopters
With an old bitch from school, she called the knockers
And she knocks on your door for that crude companion
Hollygrove Wayne, that boy a monster
Jacked by a Mazda returns in Mase-rati
I try to be monogamous but I have bitches on my dick
So I just promise this: I will give the world to my little girl
Yes, and for your sake, I am a ball every year.
And tattoo it on my face
Niggas know I got that black music on my waist
Get him to put it on your ear and get that b-b-b-b-bass
Mom doesn't remember shit, but last Saturday, what a tragedy
Flowers for the family
Dust in my nap bag
Running the projects, try to recover a stack
Got my SK to get my MAC back for pap pap on niggas yap yap
Yes Yes! and I repeat that hard 17, you know
Until a nigga is nothing but grave quotes
Raw Tune, who you know goes harder than friend
See these are the clues, part of my shoes
I bleed with them, I'm part of the crew
Don't move because you're right in the path of the muzzle
Nigga and-and-young Wayne from Carrollton
Although my path is narrow, my angels are shadows
Automatic, like nigga fuck whoever
You touch and reach, you get white
Above the law, niggas put you under
Do you call the law nigga? Damn leech!
You were saved by the bell, you fucking screech
My bucket screeches through the streets like an R&B singer
You're not a pimp until you fuck an R&B singer
And all these niggas seem objective to me
What is a drought for you can be a bargain for me
Because I can be sitting in a Ki cardboard box
I have important people trying to market me
So I'm going to stop talking about the target, Sike!
I know I'm not walking without a fight
So I sway with all my might
We can go all night
I'm a hit all day, and I'm a hit all night
Make a verse today and put on a show tonight!
I could go tonight so mama pray don't cry
Because your prayers may work, mom, they will try
Yeah and we rock with the same lullaby
Nigga I'm 10, nigga I'm 5
I hope you have yours, because nigga I have mine
I'm going for the green bitch, it's time for dad
So I can be a paid nigger and make that tombstone say "I'm a done nigger"
I'm a black fact
Little Wayne:
Yes (take me out, take me out)
Ok now we were mrs. Me and
We relax alone
We both take a pill
And now I'm feeling
I am not worried about you because I am feeling
And they feel my shoe and they feel my belt
And they feel my jean which is the one they never saw
And my watch looks like a television screen
And my pretty right wrist and my left wrist mean
So I had to get a couple more men's necklaces
Isn't that a bitch?
I'm not a bitch, they're not my words
Heavy so i hope bitches stick like paint
And all I really care about is my bank ho
And all I really care about is my bank ho
Already digg? now that you drank
I tell your bartender just a boss
Man, I'm taking one of these girls home
And we can do what we do, we grew up
We can do what we do, we grew up
We went to second base and now she's in my zone
Then we told Mr. Third Base that we're going to
I told you I'd take one of these girls home (sure)
Mack Maine:
I take a girl out of the park like Barry
She held my balls so long that the referee called her to carry
She came to the crib and thinks we got married
She tries to sneak into my bed like the tooth fairy (ha)
And all my bitches like the packages they get FedEx
You can call them next day's priority
They call the next day like "Maine, I keep rolling"
I'm fine, am I heading to the game you're still shooting?
How let me know your fate, daughter like Kelly Rowland
You think she lifts weights with her brain the way she's stubborn
You see my home is third base, I call my bed home
You call her headless miss, yeah her head is gone
She thinks she lives well but I tell her she is completely wrong
And I don't care if she's fat or slim
And I'm not T-Pain, but this is what I said to the bartender
I tell your bartender just a boss
Man, I'm taking one of these girls home
And we can do what we do, we grew up
We can do what we do, we grew up
I met her at first base standing alone
We went to second base and now she's in my zone
I told you I'd take one of these girls home (sure)
Little Wayne:
You know I come from outer space
And I'm running out of space
Because I got a lot of paper
I don't have enough space
You call that girl 7
Because she will be 8
If you call her at 7
Then you probably eat
Tomorrow I call her at 7
And girl, what does the bitch say?
"Daddy could you please come
And put some tears on my face "(haha)
I said well bitch, go get small in your face (haha)
You know a nigga had to make it rain on his face
Bitch I know you love me
If not, you're just stupid
Nigga stop talking
And why do not you do it?
But fuck me, niggas, girl, and you should
The bartender is a true boss
Man, I'm taking one of these girls home
And we can do what we do, we grew up
We can do what we do, we grew up
We went to second base and now she's in my zone
Then we told Mr. Third Base that we're going to
I told you I'd take one of these girls home (sure)
I swear I told the bartender that he was a patron
Man, I'm taking one of these girls home
First base
Second base
Third base
Us home
We can do what we do, we grew up
Young boss I see you
I get that money, that's my main commitment
All blacks only talk about all politicians
But let me get slippery
Without the patch in my eye
Take a patch from heaven, cause I'm flying
I say it a lot and Imma follows
A thousand black jeans keep going
You won't find me in my beach house
I'm out of your arm
I have a speech for them, um
Fuck them and whoever knows them, one
I'm entering Roberto's house with a filthy virgo
She feels my gangsta, I don't even have to play with her
But that came like something magical
I disappear when I dive into the bathroom
But I'll be back soon fucking raccoons with them
Like Jackie Gleason on her honeymoon.
How are you, Fuke?
Hot spitter in the building
Young money in the sand
You already catch me with two bad bitches between us
For any man I am, in fact, ha ha
And it is so
My impact is so hard if I die
I will probably recover
I walk with a mousetrap
Cheese niggas don't like rats
And despite that
I've been around a few gold fish
I'm still a shark in the ocean
I fuck the flow 0 6, 4 sent
You all don't screw up on this stunt thing
But let's get back to business
Give mutha fucka so much coke
You probably have kidney problems.
Spit them out
Jesus Christ
Young motherfucker money
The money goes back
Damn, they can't see that
There are enemies out there but I'm optimistic
You all niggas only talk politicians
I'm walking what I'm talking about
And I'm giving what I'm repainting
I'm on what I scream boy
I'm from the dirty dirty
You can't get me out of my store boy
I carry whole batteries, they can't hold that
I keep it in his back pocket and make it big
And I'm like shit, but she thought I was ignorant
He approached her like a knight.
His friends try to reach him but
I was already with them
They all act the same, I fucked them all up
Man like synonyms
She, the niggas I'm with, could give it to them
I don't know how he gets so many girls and rap
And drive like that, and the lyrics!
However, it's great, if you listen to it and like all that
Everyone needs to come find me
Curren $ and the Hot Spitta
The new knight
Oh
This is
Huh, mom used to say this when she stands on my crib
Grandma used to say this world will come to a crazy end
Monsters in my closet were the feds taking pictures of babies
Uncle used to say "Your dad is too young to raise a child"
Daddy used to treat my mom like they never made a kid
Uh, I know things turn like tornadoes
I know the way it spins, I have to wait your turn
Until you take turns, fuck a wrong turn
I'm in every song that I turn on
I have it on, I have it on
I'm on the toll highway, I'm about to turn off
Strong grass like every siren they light
So bright bust, it's burning
These diamonds so white that German
Your diamonds are not right, they are spinning
White cocaine as my lawyer
All kinds of weapons, without permits.
All kinds of coffins, all kinds of stretchers.
From my driveway to my front door
It has been quite a journey
From my driveway to my front door
It has been quite a journey
Huh, mom used to say this when she stands on my crib
Never trust anyone who can bleed for five days and live
Walking on water, this is a new world order
These niggas are out of order like a fish out of water (huh?)
Yeah I'm gonna keep shooting until the bitch stops recording
A real sharp sniper, I don't miss my target
And I don't miss my thottie, I just miss my friend
Long dressing room, I hope you feel like walking
Uh, I know the paper burns like it should burn
I know the paper burns long term
I know my great concern when I turn and turn
I know my great concern about the long term
I know paper burns like fire burns
I know it doesn't burn unless I confirm
I'm about to cross my heart and see your heart burn
Crossing me is like watching a cross burn
Bitch I'm cool as a designer yeah
It started from Ragu, it went all the way to lasagna, yeah
Drinking purple papaya, gitchi ya-ya, yeah
Mom used to say this when she stands on my crib
Never trust anyone who can bleed for five days and live
Grandma used to say this world will come to a crazy end
Monsters in my closet were the feds taking pictures of babies
Daddy used to look at me like "Who the hell is this baby?"
Uncle used to say "Your dad is too young to raise a child"
I am the son of Satan, I am the son of Satan, I am the son of Satan (I am the son of Satan)
Uh, I know things turn like tornadoes
I know the way it spins, I have to wait your turn
Until you take turns, fuck a wrong turn
I made the world go round, that's a turn
I have it on, I have it on
I'm on the toll highway, I'm about to turn off
Strong grass like every siren they light
These diamonds so white that German
All kinds of weapons, without type of permits (Yes)
All kinds of coffins, all kinds of stretchers (Yes, yes)
From my driveway to my front door (Yes, yes, yes)
It has been quite a journey

Climbing up a Suga hill, sliding down into something new
Spill gin and jungle juice, and I also got that wood
And I brought a damn zoo, tear this shit up and throw a deuce
This triple C, they triple L, licks love to lose
A hundred million in my horoscope, to show you a horror show
Tear your damn head off your clavicle

Dick-in-an-ass-black nigga
Die-quick-in-a-movie-ass nigga

Clean them up, my gear is ready, I'm as tall as Scotty take me
They say we all have to pay the price, fuck it, man, call me
Damn, I skate, ho, the pussy is my scapegoat

Man, little Weezy has a style that even I can't find.
Man, some shit is so hard, I'm like that line is not mine
And if that's less than a gram, then that line is not mine

Hey, I take three liters to my head: love, life, life, and I'm dead
Young Money, Dipset, that's what it is
And if I'm not handsome, you can bet my bitch is

A rich nigga can't even buy freedom
That's why I give my white bitches everything but freedom
I do anything with my white bitches, but I hit them

The Smith That Pain's Barrell Will Probably Make Your Body Shiver
The world will hear you say ayyy
Sitting in the Ferrari, thinking about money
Lies fly for me, I'm ducking all the bad vibes
Shoot yourself nine times in case you have cat life
Uh, my phrases give you black eyes
Like, like, I'll kill yourself, seven pounds
Now I can live and if I can, can I live it?
I'm going to squeeze life out, enough to fill the cup
Well shut your mouth and vaporize the purp
Light that wood, in the shot, take off
To another world, let them see that white moon
Flying in the sky, tell them we'll be back soon
I swear I'll go to the head with all of you, bumpercar
Nigga I'm a slum dog, millionaire, been there
Smoke some kush and snap your fingers
Too much to be established, suicidal flow
I'll kill yourself seven pounds
Forceful as Bobby Christina, tall as Serena's skirt
Just smoking that real grass, no sand grass
Can i live now And if I can, I repeat that dirty south
So shut your mouth and heat the mash, tell them they hate.
Yes, I've lost my mind, help me find it, I'll lead the search, Uhh
I heard you got that good, ready for takeoff
To another world, let them see that white moon
Flying in the sky, tell them we'll be back soon
Hey
Than?
Than?
Come on, nigga (Where are you, Wheezy?)
You probably catch me speeding up at six, or hitting a girl
We turn the scarves and spit at the blacks with cannons
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats.
Going through the house, screaming, "Where's this bastard's crack ?!"
I flash the mack in front of your girl and make her say
Like, "Whore! Where's the yay, or am I a pop on your grill!"
Pay with my change, so I'll have to fuck niggas
I pack the caine faster and I spray like rain, nigga
If you go out, you can find me on the street with work
If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with work
Never slip: empty half clip on your shirt
And put all your clique on the ground
Who wants to crawl with them?
And when it comes to guns, nigga, I sleep with them
Look, we can sweep with them because it deepens with them
And when it comes to drugs, I'm on the street with them
Who wants to fight with them?
Who wants to crawl with them?
And when it comes to guns, nigga, I sleep with them
Look
I'm the youngest Hot Boy in the field with heaters
Destroy your house and put the weapon to Lil Renita
Wow (wow, wow) you can catch me in black without smiling
Me, Turk, Geezy and 'Nile, chicka-POW!
How come these niggas keep burning the world
And why the hell is this black Wheezy holding your girl steady?
Tell your mom to bring the police because everyone will need them
Look at this for all my niggas in the pen, I hope freedom
And this for all my niggas buying bricks, I got them cheaper
Keep a nigga calm like a mouse when it comes
Who wants to fight with them?
Who wants to crawl with them?
And when it comes to guns, nigga, I sleep with them
And when it comes to drugs, I'm on the street with them
Who wants to fight with them?
Who wants to crawl with them?
And when it comes to guns, nigga, I sleep with them
Look, we can sweep with them because it deepens with them
Nasty case, nigga run in your crib, crash the place
Masking the face, automatic fixing to the waist
You bastards play? So it gets horrible and bad
There will be no more walkin for dad, and your head is going
And they are going to do it right or they do it at night
Henny and ice is what I prefer, but light on the rocks
And if there is cocaine involved, then your throat is involved
I take the toaster and roll up and smoke most of you
Me and my nigga, Super Sosa, we run in your crib
Because one of the mac's will have blood covering your back, right?
Who wants to fight with them?
Who wants to crawl with them?
And when it comes to guns, nigga, I sleep with them
Look, we can sweep with them because it deepens with them
And when it comes to drugs, I'm on the street with them
Who wants to fight with them?
Who wants to crawl with them?
And when it comes to guns, nigga, I sleep with them
Look, we can sweep with them because it deepens with them
Who wants to crawl with them?
And when it comes to guns, nigga, I sleep with them
Look, we can sweep with them because it deepens with them
And when it comes to drugs, I'm on the street with them
Who wants to fight with them?
And when it comes to guns, nigga, I sleep with them
Look, we can sweep with them because it deepens with them
And when it comes to drugs, I'm on the street with them
Who wants meat with a black man? Creep with a nigger?
When it comes to weapons, look, I sleep with them triggas
Man ... Mike, cut something!
Man, man, man, man, cut something, man!

Big ass house, no place for nonsense
So-and-so said to me, "Chuck, you're not rich!"
Well tell him so and so they can suck my dick

You could get these 30 clips if you want to make a scene
Tune, leave me without a leash, now I run through the fucking streets
Two fingers in her pussy, then I say, "Peace!"
It's Chuckee, she says, "Is your name Chuckee?"
I said, "No, my name is Suck Me!"
Introduce you to T if your stupid ass is lucky
Fuke roll them fat, they covered my nose

And you thought this shit was over
I got paper like a damn school folder
Tony, tell them bitches what the Libra gang is
Vocal lessons, let the girl sing
Before you leave this bitch, they're gonna know my damn name
Lame boys don't want no trouble, niggas pussy just a bunch of fools
Get Willie out of my pants and all the girls say, "Hercules!"
Bitch, I'm living B.I.G., my gun is a little off
If that girl doesn't take it off, I'll just skewer her fabric
That gold package in my pocket is fine; Am I like a rag in a socket?
And when I turn that girl on nine, you better not block my dick
YM be the shit, I say, "Damn everyone else"
I'm going to kick the girls out of the condo, I have a black belt
The older brother said, "It's your moment nigga"
You heard what the man said
Boy, body these verses, that's why they cost an arm and a leg
Left that coochie smoking, she's going to fail her drug test
I left!
Mike turn off the dog microphone!
The man cut the beat before Tune returned!
I'm the only one who does the job

If a nigger fucks with him, I'll leave him fast
I've been taking shit light don't you wanna hear me stumble
Damn, do they really know who they're fucking with?
Yeah i mean you can't blame me for asking me
It doesn't matter, it could be winter or summer
Along the way, I do One Direction numbers, I don't get lost
Yes, Stunna and Mack know it.
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this on our back
And yet it was on every track
I was like, "Hah, it's our time, nigga"

Dead presidents, vacant coffins

Come to town and yah niggas get to stumble
We'll take you to Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff.
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got gangs
Ink of the money, I have it in my hands
Going out to Houston, spending all my advance
V Live just brought me a check
"Drake, you know I love you, you got me out of debt"
Yes now you're looking for the best
Mothafuck shows awards and mothafuck the press as well
When they jumped off the porch, I was climbing the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connection
It would be a cold day in hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, sliding down my neck
Niggas know what that means they're deaf
Nigga, I'll fire this girl like it's her first day
Tune in, be humble, nigga, I'm a king
I need a horn and a roll
Throw cursed roses at my feet, nigga

Bitch okay, foreleg (think daddy)
And she goes both ways (thinks daddy)
I got a trunk full of bumps (think daddy)
I have cribs, cars, bikes, levees (think daddy)
Cause that's what they love (think daddy)
Now I do it for the ladies, do it for the ladies
I do it because I want to push a cat's eye Mercedes
I do it for my friends, I do it for my friends
All the niggas on the block that got that job to move
It's Weezy baby, young and dirty south
Like thirty in my mouth, then I can tell
Fuck you bitch, you still don't have a dirty mouth
The hood has not yet passed the drain
So you should sleep on your roof, just to watch over your house
Jazze Pha, let's jump to Lammy (Lamborghini)
Stop by Sammy, relax on the hood, it's okay, your family
My boys like to throw blammies and big pimp
Mommy sucks cock until hammy pulls you homey
You know we just keep it gangsta
Deep in the range, 17 in the chamber
All I need is my hit, nigga, it's Weezy
This shit is over, someone gave me a sign
You can't hear me, this is a definitive jam, call me Russell, man
And now you know that I'm the yee-yo muscle, man
But deep down, I have that wonder, to stop that thunder
That rumble on the side of your stomach, piled in water
How do you want it? Come on a blue powder Coupe or
Stop with water, how do you want it man?
I drove a lot of QP here and there on the way
Because the black has to move his son, and I show you how to make this son
That's that guy Weezy We, CMB, BITACH, and you stunned
(Chorus)
Ok, Gucci backpack, Adidas cool black
I'm rolling on a pill, rolling up some reefers
Rejecting all the Keishas, responding to the Kims
I'm a motherfucker, Weezy F. Baby
Yeah I wet it and keep it wet baby
I can make a levee say she leaves that lady
I can make a lady say that she leaves that black ass
That gave her that baby, now she with
Hahaha, Weezy F. Baby, hahaha, yeah
Whatcha gon ', whatcha gon', whatcha gon 'do?
When Nina Ross comes and puts your pussy on you
You're probably still a virgin, I'm going to burst your little cherry
And I'm going to go through something so cherry
And I'm sitting in Pirellis, hitting Makaveli
I showed your girlfriend my house, she thinks I live in Italy
Bitch I never knew, I'm about to meet that bitch in L.A.
Ooh, I'm feeling
I'm so underpaid I could really buy stealth
Because I don't see them in anyone
I have the semi by myself for anyone
Yeah i'm uptown yeah i'm uptown
Yes, I'm from the upper part, from the east side, I light two blisters at the same time
And I thank God I can say fuck once
I am drinking two cups at once
And I thank God I can say fuck once
Fuck once, fuck once, fuck once, thank goodness
Louis V. bag, all black hammer
In the Louis phone box with the buddy box
I could put L.V. on the side of my bitch face

I beat that track until that blue and black bitch
It's Weezy F. the monster, even F your mom
Even X your mom, I leave you next to mom
You are as gonorrhea as your scent
The blind gynecologist might see that your vagina
WHO? Me? Me? Turn the meat into a balance
And your girl rides me like a Honda
Better yet, she rides me like Travis Pastrana
Fuck the X Games, they are ecstasy games
Show me a mirror because I'm so glad to meet Wayne
And I feel
So it flies badly, I think I really fly stealth
But I'm so underpaid I could really buy stealth
I have never seen them in anyone
I have the semi by myself for anyone
Yeah i'm uptown yeah i'm uptown
Work hard, be someone.
I know something more than what you see in the mirror;
Let the world be your mirror, don't let them judge you;
because the mirror cannot judge you.
Fuck me? Thanks come on yeah
Oh fee i got them boy
Baby, slim too, well, Weezy Baby
You can't see me, but I see you and I see you
Sir! I-I-I have them
Bring the crowd, and I'm loud in vivid color
It's Weezy Fuckin 'Baby, I got these rappers in my stomach
Delicious, I'm taking it, I'm not asking you for anything
If you sell a million records, we could fight for your money.
I'd rather count a hundred thousand dollars on Sunday
The last car on the market with the top off
Big wheels make it look a bit bulky
Relax, the weapons are still out
I'm busy, I have paper to roll
God I hope they break at the end of my rod
I hope to fish in the right pond
And I hope you understand each line: who am I?

The quarterback, well protected from the Warren Sapp
The young heart attack, I spit out that heart
Can't you see me, baby, you have cataracts

Since everyone is a king, where the hell is your palace?
Me? I got numb in my hands, I can handle that
Yes, and I'm not even out of breath
Swagger right, check, tight game

You against me is like man vs. Wild

And we prefer the red carpet if the floor is not clean
It's the lord, it's the demon from the microphone.
Yes, and if all the lights could scream
They sang my song, I like to be seen
I deserve to be heard if anything else
So I fear that God and the world will go deaf

Because look, I respect the merit of a fan
No homo but please blow me to Japan
Ok i'm getting hotter i need another fan
I keep so here I go again
Always trying to be better than me
Label me as the best and I'll stand on the throne
Your hands smoke me cause I have your hands up

No x-ray shows my insides
And I have to be in touch with my pimp side
So tell your girl I said what's up ... I said hello ...
She likes that, what happens ... like heaven ...
Byrd Gang taking off, bitch, watch them fly
And paint the sky red like the Crimson Tide
That gold medal is heavy but it fits well
So I just had to spit out this rhyme
Spit like I'm trying to kiss this rhyme with my tongue
Some say greatness improves over time
So I bought a million watches, but don't look at mine
You little fucks are so stupid
Nickel plus fo 'is a nine millimeter
No starch but I have i-ron
Everything out in the open like I-ran
But um, could I applaud and then turn off the lights
I don't take nights off, but my days are the same
And people change, but fuck it, nothing stays the same
Lock me up but you could never blame
Gasoline, can you imagine if our gaze were flames?
No you can't stop my environment, a couple pages of a game
Dang, a game? Yeah give me some baby flames
Lord save the rings, I'm too vain hehe

You're playing like you're trying to change the mane
But I'm more of a dog than the Great Dane
You guys acting like ladies well
Crying like you're about to have mane
And you can find me grinding the days we play

Ladies and gentlemen, yours is truly DJ Drama. For the first time, one cypher one by one, one battle one by one, two MCs. One has sold more than 80 million records, a thousand performances, numerous Grammy's and BET awards, and the other has done nothing. Let's go
Look at your vocabulary, because I'm going Conan Bárbaro
My watch is like Halle Berry.
Man, I saw my father bury, man, I saw my ex get married
She used to blow up X with Paris, I made her lie down next to Sarah
We used to have sex on camera, I used to pop X and viagra
And acting was natural resistance, double tasting like Pamela
Bend her like a gambler, street sweeper, I'm a janitor
All of you weak as a calendar, hehe, beyond the weak
Yeah I'm closing in on a billion arm reach
Yes, all I could see from my building are palm trees.
Heh, we're leaking, and all of you weak
I leave your brains right on your broad cheek
And blood stains on your offspring
I think the gang and the police that all linked
Wait, why are you shuddering? Call your minion slime
Demon looking in a haystack slime syringes
See them touch up, see them cry, see them limp limo
That some slime from Symptons, I can avoid em slime
Divide your head in two as a split decision, slime
I've been through hell and came back, came back in perfect condition
Wait, now is the time to drop the window, slime
I'm going hard, like Kimbo, slime
You know my M.O. slime, spit that A-M-M-O, slime
Wait, I'm going hard, like Kimbo, slime
You know my M.O. slime, spit that A-M-M-O, slime
Tunechi
(Whoo)
I'm going to make it really simple and qaint
Before I start, yell at my brother, my man Kevin Hart
Go see his movie What next?
Ay Drama (What's up Droppa?)
You are all like an old man walking down the street in a Pamper
I'm about to shit on these niggas (what?)
I guess it all depends
Play on words, find out
Let's get it
Dirty sandy grains on your lady boobs
Sloppy Joes, I'm spreading it, one all hoes
I'm taking back what's mine, I'm talking about that fucking fame
Whoo, you did it to yourself people
Droppa back, about to do it with you
Uh, that anger is at its highest point
Yes, like my bread, I'm talking about rye
Uh, money coming out of the duffel bags
I have the garbage bag, dark green
I come back in different languages and I don't play
Uh, Droppa, Droppa, Droppa
I'm talking about my car, the old one
Important fact, take the gun, take your son, you better run
Change my flow, let me get really serious
Because when Droppa comes hard, I go crazy
I'm not playing, I'm tearing it down, I'm going back to my land
Whoo, Drama, slow down twice
Important fact, tell everyone I hate mice, uh huh
Rodents make me sick, they can kiss my ass
Come back once, Droppa, first not last, come on
(Bars)
187 bars in two minutes
It has never been done
I made a time, get your money or let your check catch you
Disgusting
The Carter is the place
And I'm running this like I'm walking in the race like they're walking in place
Then I walk in that place like you give me my cake
And yes, I'm Martian, so give me my space
Timmet me, timmet me, I never date Ups, I mean, you never told me just uhhh after that, remember her
I send you back to the womb you came out of
I milk this thing, now boy raise your cows
Shorty give me brain like I'm smart like Brittany Houser
And I stay connected like an internet browser
There's no one like you in this bitch
Whoa, fuck with other niggas
Carter V
Fuck with other niggas
There's no one else like you in this bitch
Are you ready?
Ridin 'on a damn new machine, going down like a missile
Machine gun to a black column like "Listen"
Nigga listen, don't move motherfucker
And the world is mine like Twism
It's that Carter V, let me get them
I know all of New Orleans covered my back
Remove the dirt from my shoulders and clean my act
This that C5, thanks Jesus, I'm back
Because there is only one, do not remove the patch
Man I got this whole fucking world on my back
It wasn't my hands but there is blood on my hands
Watch my fingers make a capital B
I throw gang posters and I don't care where they land
I know the 17 turned their back on me
The backbone of my hood, I am the spleen of my trap
There's death in the air, you could catch a contact
You may need to shorten the incline after that
Man, I swear I drank a lot of lean, I almost passed
I'm not trying to say that I've been clean after that
No more Lil Tunechi, no more king of rap
Life can disappear in the blink of an eye
Oh, but don't judge me, judge the one in the mirror
In your bathroom you found a sink full of glass
Just when they thought and think it wouldn't last
I woke up and I just got Carter Five that they ass
We got this far, I'm so proud of my niggas
I'm for my niggas, I'm coming ...
I'm just saying this shit here
The best mixtape series of all time
Uh-uh-uh-mmmm
Do you mind debating me?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, sick shit
I thought so
Keep that shit on Twitter, they're not on, they're in the trash
Watching me do push-ups
She was playing with herself and I looked up, damn
You're plotting me, my foot up, huh
Your squad isn't hard, that's cushion, huh
Tunechi on his chest, damn
Don't say my gun, I called the trigger
Benjamin Button, push it, bam!
All of you just pussy, bury them together and let them play feet
You all are bad, I have some thugs who are going to wear sweatshirts
And come take a look, better play hard
I have some prostitutes connected with politicians
And some athletes, and some college niggas.
Send your lady on all kinds of missions.
I'm the sickest nigga who skips doctor visits
But my pots are upset, smoking sticky hockey
Put a sock on my face and give me a lick and
When the shit gets ugly, I get pretty Ricky
I don't fuck with rats, nor Minnie, Mickey
I'm not messing with the police, that's the pig
Fuck my bitch's friends, and they're friendly
While your bitch gives me her twenty eight
Like I'm tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like I'm tired of Macy's, JC Penney's
I got bitches tired of spending, spending it
If we win, we win
I know dream buyers who never dreamed of it
So I had to dye it and I had to skirt it
And I worked on the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to wealth, they need happy endings
Then come back to goodness, and we laugh at the sentence
Hungry attorneys snack witnesses
Hungry artists or hungry artists
In the kitchen, restaurant and cafes.
Better pay the difference to blackmailers
Now the artificial becomes a sacrifice
That is a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clit and fattest nipples
With a throat deep enough to launch a missile?
If your nigga misses you and he has opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a cent
Now we in your villa pointing at your pillows
Hair triggers, finna fingers act like bristles
Throwing pool parties, she doesn't have a swimsuit
None of his friends do it, I think it's official
I have my neighbor's eyes bigger than the Simpsons
And send you back looking like the Dracula that bit you, rrr!
These niggas clones, imitators and chameleons
Once they die and go, there is no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sounds familiar? My plug is Sicilian
You have to leave your family behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I am the reason
They opened their eyes wide but were too blind to see it.
With friends like that
Hallelujah, intruders of power
Bitch walk around my house like Hooters
Towel user, advanced user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly / Susan
Niggas talking about your bowel movements
Turn your friends into flower pickers
Tell a doctor who tries to save your life
And running cables through you, I could die by your side, rrr!
I'm going to make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let your partner film it, we take the film out
Win prizes, get a Golden Globe head and an Oscar loot
These rappers aren't talking shit, not even pollution
I don't have a house to live, I don't have a swimming pool
Change in your pockets, not a sofa to lose it.
On the way to Houston with a contribution
Full of Monster juices, Mazda too slow
Male, Cujo, male much
Big big bad wolf, watch the moon shine, rrr!
I have a Greek monster, she calls me Antetokounmpo
I'm hotter than soup, she still swallows my bowl of soup
I'm out of my loophole, you're out of the loop
I got all these niggas in quiet and silent mode
Get the mule per minute
Fuck me, I'm going Lolapaloozo
Pull up, act your finger, scream and pull
Hitting some new notes
And I'm the teacher, and you're just a typo
I got myself a new ho, and now it's a duo
One went to university and another to ju-co
I had to ask them, what are four plus two? Rrr!
My best basketball dream team
The first five are probably umm
Of course I have to start with Kobe Bryant, umm
This is gone, take a minute, umm, Chris Paul
Uhh, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James
You know they are my top five, I have money in them
Hello to you boy
Little nigga, I've seen keys bigger than you
Cut off a black man's head, make him suck his own cock
How's the game going
Money on bitches and flowers on snitches
Money on bitches and flowers on snitches
Mr., Mr. Scarface, gun on garden fish.
(What the hell is this?)
Mr., Mr. Scarface, gun on garden fish.

I only do this shit for my clique, like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop and I'm going to keep it on my channel
Bitch, look at me, but they can't see me, like Hitler
It is New Orleans nightmare.
Money is so old it's growing gray
I'll make sure we dance till we drop like tears
And mom, don't cry, your son can handle his
And sure enough, I have Miss Cita in a better place
When I was 14 years old, I told my mom that we will see better days
I say to my girl "When you fuck me you better fuck me good
Because if another girl could, she would fuck me well "
Do not sit at the table if you do not bring anything
And I get right to it like it's nothing
Yes i have a game like stuart
Scott, fresh out of the ESPN store
But you can't fool me, I know what you're seeing

22.5 for Venus
11th floor for La Serena
Drink codeine like Aquafina
My jalapeña bitch

Flying over New Orleans

My eyes tight like Yao Ming
I smoke some very large vegetables

Your bitch is a great devil
Your bitch is a big fan
But I have no roofs
I have no roofs
I have no roofs

Born to live

And TMZ said I died (damn)
I run with slaps
Your hate does not impact us
The cocksuckers of our bitches
The pic-snappers of your bitches
You're just a camera rapper
But we don't target you with cameras
We aim hammers at them
More bullets than hammer dancers
We take the pineapple
And we fill it with purple, we never settle
We take the Mac-11
We point that bitch straight to your cerebellum
Bah!
Yeah and this world is mines
Yes i'm getting mines
Yes i'm drinking lines
Drinking, oh, are we talking thin?
Oh, are we talking lean?
Oh, are you coming?
Look at the smile on me
And the game drove me crazy
Over a hundred thousand miles on me
Damn he said he would lie to me
That's why I fuck you all
I still love you all
With a rubber
Because they are the husbands' dogs
And to top it off
All lids are off
And it's winter season
But the seats get hot
I have a great regimen
I've been part of some really great schemes
I just busted a big bean
I just busted a big bean
I rock some really big bling
I sleep in a really big king
With a very thick queen
I sleep with a very thick queen
In a really big king
She screams really big screams
She says I have a really big jingle
She says i'm doing really great things
I should be doing really great scenes
On a really big screen
You see, I have really big dreams
And what a routine ...
I fuck a clit for everything
I put a sip on everything
I put a sip on everything
No roofs
Tight pants, new pairs of vans
If the niggas keep tripping, they can share an ambulance
My gang busting niggas
Smoke that Kiesha, not that Reggie
By your name falling niggas
All day I do it, I do it like Tony
I have a sign on my cock that says "Bad Bitches Only"
I don't drink champagne, my stomach hurts

Yes, I talk shit, I have to defecate to talk
Take her to the crib, get into her pussy and dominate
Weezy F. Baby and the 'F' is for fornicating
Polo Ralph Lauren, bitch, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounce
Snot on my watch face with vomit face
And still I don't give you motherfuckers the time of day
Gun in your mouth, I can't understand what you're trying to say
Then tell them motherfuckers "Bombs away"
Man all these bitches and niggas still hate

Finish when the city is windy and the beautiful Cindy
He dressed in the pretty Fendi and drank remy
I'm Iceburg nothing but Whinnie all the way to my tennie
I am hotter than a semi because this skirt has mini
And also my head is spinning from drinking this fifth of Henny
I stop at any store because she's cursed with her penny
And I can't say how many she's been to
Slowly the lights dim and I'm sliding on my Jimmy
I sit with her boobs, this is just the beginning
I stick it on her kitty, now she screams, give me
And when it's time to quit I have it soaked and dripping
She asked me for a kiss ah ..
Biznite is your trippin
Biznite is your trippin
Than
Biznite is your trippin
Nothing but a sack chasing rooster tastin biznite
You will never be anything more than a biscuit
Because all I want to do is hit him rough. I don't even want to talk
If your baby is born with braids, I'm not the father
Hell no, I'm not the father
No i'm not the father
If your baby comes out saying what ... I'm not the father
I get in a Porsche Boxter and I see this fox named Tasha
I caught her when I stopped her at McDonalds with her partner
I joked about the way she rocked her Lil Versasce and her Prada
I'm Iceburg or Bahama from bottom to neck
I wrote him my phone number later he gave me a holla
I appeared next to their moms so that their black doesn't know anything
Now I got in my car and started talking about his doctor
I go back to the label and put the top
Under all the windows and I put the car into operation "look at the"
It took five minutes to hit, so you know she's the right one
I'm hitting their brains
We got the car shaking and rockin '
She asked me for a kiss ah
Biznite what is your problem
Than ..
That
Nothing but a sack chasing rooster tastin biznite
You will never be anything more than a biscuit
Because all I want to do is hit him rough. I don't even want to talk
No i'm not the father
Hell no, I'm not the father
Hell no, I'm not the father
There was a stupid name where Lucy approached me at the cinema.
He said he just saw Balla Blockin and thought I was cute
And but you and your baby can also come early on Tuesday
I just bought a new mansion, I just finished it and my movie
I knew it was a brand new head to shoulder look at this Gucci
And I'm Iceberg Tom and Jerry, Daffy and Goofy
But lately he got scared, his boo just came from the institution
I say it's great because I really don't want to have to shoot him
I gave Braud the locator number and said he should use it
As soon as I flew by in that navy and baby blue six
It rang and left a message that a solution occurred to him.
She didn't have a swimsuit and then she wants me to see her booty
He was oozing it in his coochie when he entered my jacuzzi
She asked me for a kiss ah
Biznite you are stupid
Biznite you are stupid
Than
Biznite you are stupid
Because you are nothing but a sack chasing rooster tastin biznite
You will never be anything more than a biscuit

Lose a back, you should go back
Blucka blucka, you should suffer
Lose a mother, motherfucker your mother
Fuck your brother, that son of a bitch died like John Tucker
I'm the only streak in the water that kills
They introduced me to the game, now I'm in front of them as team outages
Get dressed and tie your boots
It's war time
It's Weezy Baby, no crime, no lying
All of you motherfuckers slipping, you better wait
I think they stumble like Cedric and Solange
I can say don't rhyme and that rhymes
Six shit
Six nigga, six nigga, Dedication 6, nigga
Six nigga, sick nigga, sick six shit, nigga
I hear you all new and I shudder (I shudder)
Your girlfriend loves me and my friends (my friends)
We left E11even at 11 a.m. (Yes)
Raw papers full of peace, cups full of chaos (Yes)
Being the best of all is my destiny yet (Ok)
Since I was little I concentrated on my Kelly, Bey and Michelle (Ok)
Sitting back, getting the head of a young lady (Ok)
Trying to put every child in the ghetto with a dream in my will (Amen)
Dedicated to you for the sixth time, killed him in the fifth
Now they say I'm big
While the niggas skipped lunch, I learned to skip the lines
I learned to kick, hit, pierce to get mines
I used to fuck Sega, my uncle had a pager (screech!)
I met this drug lord who tried to run for mayor (skrrt!)
Posted in the back blocks, player-player talking
If it's bad then I update it, I get your unlimited data (blrrp!)
And build underground railroads, so the Maybachs fit in
Cover your soul before they take that shit
Young
Right nigga, wrong nigga, drug black, sick black
Rich nigga, pole nigga, bigger house, bigger bills
Sick nigga, hill nigga, on nigga, quiet nigga
Racks nigga, really bigger, Shaq-bigger, lil nigga
Coca-Cola-Coca-Cola, nigga, slopes, niggas, hills, nigga
Joke, black? No, black, bigger clip, quick trigger
Thick strippers, I'm not into stick figures, mixed signals
O.J. With the brick, black running through the white
Nigga, O.J. On my wrist, nigga, that's Sunny Delight
Nigga straight from New Orleans, like a dirty plate of rice
Nigga bought a lot of art and I brought a lot to snort, hey
Hitting a bush just after the court case expires
I take off from Earth and take your bitch to MySpace
I tell him to keep his mouth shut, if not, I have duct tape
I have to keep the lock secure, referring to the Safelock
Shelves fall, the ground shakes, does the James Brown do
I still wear the same crown, light skin or light brown
I still penetrate her, hit her with the bomb
Some niggas like to fight crime, some niggas like to fight fair
Some niggas have an iPhone, some niggas have a SkyTel
Some niggas really pythons, I'm taking care of myself
Tattoos, black skin, red eyes, blonde hair
I jumped off the Con-Air and landed in a timeshare
I wear Versace glasses, I feel like the top shelf
Great as two Ls and Rock Bells, as hot as Scottsdale
Bomb
Blackin 'out, blackin' out
We're on drugs, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out
All weapons, blacken, blacken, blacken-blacken
Running away, acting, acting, acting, acting, me (Bow!)
Yes faint faint
We're on drugs, pass out, pass out, pass out, pass out
All weapons, blacken, blacken, blacken-blacken
Running away, acting, acting, acting, me

Now this is what you were waiting for.
You dig, Santana
Weezy F
Ay Wayne
What's up, man
Oh you know I have the new Curren $ album and
Oh I'm ready to shake my shoulders and leave my next album black too
That is what it is
But dig this, they want to know what we've been working on together
That's "I can't feel my fucking face" they know that
So if you ever thought that the South and the North were going to collide
Guess what, we already did it
I feel like a black republican, no I can't call him
More like a black democrat running out of the office (out)
Young Barack-a Obama, I agree
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen on you
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay plump like Toccara
Or should I say fat like the Parkers?
Tote big guns like he's still playing Contra
You all laundered like laundered money
Honestly, the girls tied to my dick like a harness
Rock star, more flying than an ostrich
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I will shine forever, it will never tarnish
Money buried behind my house like a garden
All green, my bank account is like a forest
I can't feel my face is starting
And Weezy is my accomplice, you dig
A black activist like Sonny Carson.
Stripes of a sergeant, greet me
And girls, I got them high, higher than the turbulence
White Phantom, looking so fergielicious
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims.
It's getting rich, going to jail, or being a victim of murder
Yes! Now all of you listen
I feel like a black republican, I wear the MAC in public and
Act so far south and die for my brothers, money
Money, money, like Mac money and publishing
Cold streets but the heat makes me feel a pact
I've had cake, you're late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like an eagle but no, I'm not Donovan
Boy, you better go eat soup with your mother and them
And my mind is on another continent.
I am real cash, no counterfeits
I don't park much cool, I'm just a politician
But I have everything in your mouth like Polident
New Orleans representative to the end. me
Come from the city where the shine doesn't shine
Wake up a nigga like he got a place to be
I am a volcano full of lava about to explode again
I'll take the iron, don't make me plug it in
Stay away from the rich kids business, don't mess
I'm left with a girl who's ready to unbutton her
My Listerine comes out, she starts to eat
I'm above you guys, I'm floating
Juelz, why dodge them ?, bending over who?
I'm on the hood like "What does he do?", Comfortable
And believe me, it's nothing
Send my London boys to English muffin
Poodles barking too much, they bring muzzles through you You're not a ravine, you're gullible
They need love, they need hugs.
They need church, Jesus! It could be because
They they (Losers), and we we (Winners)
And above, this is just a sample, yes, a free medicine
Shipping is in, we are done
But, I don't trust guys, like a prenup
They roaches must be disturbed
I'm really playing, you have to get up
I can't hear them boys, they have to talk
What are you guys saying?
I have the driver holding the umbrella over my head when it's not raining
And we want the world to know
This is not a diss song either
Recognize or step aside, dig
We let the music speak, Drought 3
And by the way, it's Santana, I'm back
It's Weezy!
DipSet for life

Baby Wayne knows what you like
Now baby it's gonna shine, cause you're shiny
And I'm more you're too bright
Baby, they are going to be
Blinded by the light
Accelerated like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Blinded, blinded
Blinded by the light
Hears! Look baby they write my name in the sky bitch
Don't forget that the liquor store is what I tell the driver
Twenty Dutch masters and straight level vodka
I can pedal back and go forward
Look under the mattress, you could find four of them
I can go through the atlas without going
I can fuck an actress and never have been in movies
Chea I am a girl, an offspring of breast beauty
I'm a man in every way, I have pennies
Since I got rich, I have tints in every Bent '
How I know the tension comes out like vents
I'm doing hell, light up an L right on
Facing the laws, I'm tougher than all of you
But I get enough checks, I screw around and check it
Look, check it out, this is Evisus
America won't even let them out (ha ha)
I feel great, I'm dating
And I don't leave paraplegics, I squeeze it
Until I see your spirit rise with my own eyes nigga
I'm on mine, nigga, I got this like a bitch, I got time, nigga
They speaking in hindsight, I'm right now
I stop at you like Shaktyr
Tryna jump on this Maybach, way back girl
Upload that team as soon as possible
Whisper in your ear this pussy Wayne, say it again girl
Now she on the whip with houses
He hears the same songs that I fucked her
Yes. I lie down, I'm comfortable
Yes. Weezy baby, bum
Yes. I did my service in the navy
Now I'm just a veteran, they always pay me
Dig me like a shovel, mom, I'm a rebel
I come from under that rock and I became a pebble
Baby I'm a problem so turn up the treble
You say he's smart, I call him whatever
What blood klot?
What blood klot?
Dreadlock rasta, hair like paste
I'm rude, badman shotta
What blood klot?
I'm a rude boy, with me dreadlocks
I'm a bad boy, Imma 2Pac
Choppa choppin half off like a coupon
Imma lil nigga, please no, sit down toad, because if you're stoned
Imma boom bap bap, with the oowap bap
I don't make bitches, bourgeois act
Excuse my French, I only do moi
But she makes coke, she molly, she moonrocks
Yes..
Weezy threw a snitch from the roof, bye
I don't do carlots, I do the dupont
Balling and what not
Bitch, I've been playing since the hook shot
When I saw my first thousand I am not shocked
Take a sip and take a pill when the hook drops
Take a sip and take a pill when the hook drops
What blood klot?
What blood klot?
I'm in the two-door Benz Coupe with bug eyes
I'm in the two-door Benz Coupe, Bumpin Thug Life
211s at night, 187s in broad daylight
Catch you in a red light, make your eyes low (bap bap)
Banana clips look like a banana in an exhaust pipe
And the blacks in wheelchairs are half dead
Real money niggas is in the feds
Damn I wasn't home I was on the streets
I'm never home, I'm on the streets
A hound of money, turning hoes around
I'm not fucking with them niggas because they have a fun style
I'm not fucking with them niggas because they have a fun style
I'm not fucking with them niggas because they have a fun style
100 pounds in the trunk, drove 100 miles
Make a deal, drop it and then turn around
Hunt you down, take your shit and then we'll kill you
I feel my height going down, roll another ounce
Take a shower with your bitch and let me rub
She says you're small, but that dick looks like a muclebound
Give me the pussy, tear up and down
Crash dummies better fool around
Smoking hard and we love the sound
Yes, sweet like Gil Scott.
Yes it looks like a guwap
When the hook falls
Take a sip and take a pill when the hook drops
Tunechi badman, rude boy, Imma shotta
Exploit
Dreadlock rasta, hair like paste
Exploit
Ouuwee ... baby mule ...
What blood klot?
What blood klot?
I'm a rude boy, with me dreadlocks
Dreadlock rasta, hair like paste
I'm rude, badman shotta
The streets make the hustlas
Hustlas makes the world go round
Keys, ounces and pounds are made of hustlas
Watch the shit come back for you
Watch the shit come back for you
I have to kick the oven now watch it bubble
And you can knock on my door
But you can't hit the hustle
But I ... it's like a game of twenty-one and I'm nineteen
Lil Weezy Wee is going to eat this is how it is
I got insurance on the floor, man, I'm so positive
And I'm hairy in the flabby lens
Me and my squad in the paddy wagon Tally Benz
And you know I put the magazines on it
.45 mack with the flash on that
Who wants it
Everyone sings
And I will shine because I have shine in my bloodline
I have that mass because I have hustle in my bloodline
And when I move, I move with the raw
I'm moving in with the squad
I throw lives and the lowest to live
For my loaf of bread the town player
I did what the culture said
And I live for La Costra Nostra said
Fuck you, I'll hit your head on the shoulder
Get it right, I'm a soldier until I'm dead
This boy is white with grommets inside that bled
I'm so tall and I really don't even know why
And lay my mat down, lay it down again
But I never put my mack down
You see the bully in me
You meet Weezy, the young son of Bubba-B
Buy my basketball shorts with thunder B
If you want it then come to me
I'm here
I'm awake
Live badly to die well
Know how to move when you rush through the days without food
And she's not a bitch
And you probably see me through some crack before six
And after that everything is bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I ask you not to play with me at all
The shots hit your ass and make three of you
It will take three of you to fill one of my shoeprints
Suitable for two clips
The child is a nuisance
Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music
And the plane
Sailing through the flock with the sheep on fire
Like shit, this is more than grass, it's 500 degrees
(I'm fine because Dizzy is wild here)
Well it's time to make my mark, I gave you an advantage (yeah)
Now I'm on my Nicki shit, I don't need no scams (Nah)
Time to raise the bar, rapping like the bar has passed (Yes)
You might think I'm riding a bike, boy, the way I handle the bars (Yeah)
Real niggas in charge (Yeah), we come back for what's ours (Ours)
Poppin 'all these blues, I could become an Avatar
They don't want to see me back, he's back
Human crack in the flesh, I'm sorry, I had to relapse (I'm sorry)
These weak niggas, I hit 'em, I twist' em like grass wraps
Still in my Nino Brown, still getting G-money in G-packages (Woo)
No Stunna Man, bustin 'like Duh Duh Man, it's obvious
These hoes love me, they say my dick is medicine
Cosby, pouring jelly, still pushing and pedaling
Never settling down, I'm like DiCaprio in The Revenant
Still whipping and stretching, two pots, ambidextrous
You throw it at me, I'm catching it
From a tenant in the houses to owning my residence (one)
The phone keeps clicking, I feel like the receptionist
Out of this world, yes, he is, alien (Woo)
My life is a fucking movie, boy, don't edit yourself (Outside)
I'm like Steph on the free kick, that piece hit, I never miss
I taught your girl how to spank the girl, now she's a lesbian (Yeah)
You can level up, it won't be at my level yet, it's level ten
These niggas are hot, I must be kettlin '
Your bitch says I'm number two, yeah, very different (True)
Weakest pocket, start singing, yeah, loose lippin (loose)
Tell the prosecutor that I have never been a fecal pigeon (ever)
Be smart because Bounce he's a fool
It's on, let's say it's on, I'm 7-Eleven with it
That's twenty-four seven with him, wherever, whatever with him, yeah (wherever)
Your mom is going to need a church with a reverend
Just pray it's a paradise, and I hope they let you in, yeah
Boy I expose the truth in lies (yeah)
Cross me and crucify yourself, don't shoot five
On a sheet like the sheikh riding through Dubai (Yeah)
Game back in a choke, the rope was tied (Ayy)
Suicide, it's suicide
Tell them to search and you will find because I'm going to lose my mind
Is to do or die, I come from where we used to commit crimes
The Uzi 9 is more important than school supplies, the pools are dry.
Pigeons are too scared to fly, rules are denied
All the toughest thugs are mine, it's the Tunechi slimes
They kill you and they will make the time, we unify
Young Money revolutionized the new design
We had to leave coincidences behind and grow big
The numbers through the ceiling and the sky.
Don't look too surprised look through the lines
We make movements and strides, grooves and vibrations
I'm too alive these hoes need to be supervised
She gets cock and a ride on Uber, number two with fries, I'm cool
Now who am I? I am who and why
I'm rude and kind, my cars are computerized
I'm crossing by, smoking blunt the size of Ruben
You fools can try, these tools are used, they sacrificed
Brrt, skrrt, shoot, then drive
Now who survived? We go back to rewind
I'm usually high, drinking Houston wine
Feel humanized, I want my throne to rest
Jackie red, Julie blonde, Cuban well
I hurt my spine, I go to sleep until nine
Super stuck to the routine, my crew, my tribe
These bitches try to divide, we too are divine
Got the drugs to provide the coolest highs
The greenest green and the white with the bluest eyes.
Syrup and juice collide, the two combine as suits and ties
Magic, poof, bye
Smoke good weed
Yeah those guys come back
Bitch, we ride, then we shoot
Is to do or die
Smoke good weed
It's bloody mary if you fuck with me
Yeah those guys come back
Bitch, we ride, then we shoot
Is to do or die
Smoke good weed
Bitch I'm mack maine
And this young money
Lil Brotha, get them
Done what I shouldn't do what they say I couldn't
Hidden where all the assassins hid
Hanged where the other hustlas hung
Waiting for the return
Get that
Now you niggas is slowing down fast
If I tell you niggas is holding cash
Rollin coming out of the ghost's ass
Put trash beds away from you by talking to a gas can
There is nothing to say, no matter who comes to ask.
And murder is no fun, but we love to laugh
Take a black bitch and fuck her
And send her back with nothing
Give it back to your sister, give it back to your cousin
Yes go make a stack or something
Go and buy yourself a column and return the front
Yes and to end that discussion
I've had strength, I only have the muscle
I see my people struggling to wish they weren't
The government tries to put us in a muzzle
But you are two fingers, you are not the pieces of the puzzle
Shit, tell everyone their own hustle
And I rush all night and then I go home to fuck
Hawaiian punch tastes like robitussin
A nigga jus livin jus breath jus puffin '
Come on mommy, scroll and snuggle up
Yes miss we can't go any further
Ass hungry niggas, I got two burgers
Who wants beef? Who wants beef? I take it to the door of your house and now you seem nervous
Two swervin 'seats
Traffic to hell with it
Shit, you can't die with that, you can't go to jail with that
It could also be wild to pass by and feel it
I stand out fishtail and follow it
Give niggas something to tell them bitches
Smells like money in a full court dispute
The family at the table got a four-course dinner.
Young money cash money dump confetti on da winner
And your platoon can't handle destruction
Hard body baby killing sounds like seduction
Niggas chase the junkie bitches following the instructions
Sometimes you have to put all the rooster in the oven
So tell the public that I'm going to do my thing
As soon as I hear dat bing
I have to enter
Going up
And running upwards will take you in that wheelchair forever
it's whatever
I'm still here forever
Cause the lil'nigga better than all of you niggas together
I left
That's what they tell me x3
When the remy is in the system, it is not known, am I going to fuck or not?
That's what they're screaming
You don't need me for anything else my nigga
When the remy is in the system
I don't know where I'm going to kiss them
Why they scream
And from day one I have waited for 3, 4, 5 bitches in my Porsche Coupe
Yeah i'll be in that butt like a horse shoe
And if your religion is true, let's visit the moon
You come?
That's what they say when they touch me and listen to me on the radio
That's what they tell me
When the remy is in the system
There is no doubt that I am going to screw and dissuade them
Let them never be missing
I live it like these are my last days
If time is money, I have a pay hour
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas more fake than a little flour in a dust bag
Yeah i put it like my hands hurt
I'm at a natural high, but I land perfectly
Some of us are lovers, most of you hate
But I put up a wall, and they just paper it
So love me or hate me, I'm free from hate
They say we learn from mistakes; that's why that's why they confuse me
I have some weight on my shoulders, for me it's like feathers
Everyone say hello to Weezy, call him bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Because life is a movie that I have seen many times
You're outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it doesn't matter
I'm gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yes.
And I'm a hard hit, polo drawers, showing
I-don't-give-a-beautiful-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing no matter where you go
You don't need a bus pass to break your ass, nigga
I'm a blunt hit, polo drawers showing
I-don't-give-a-beautiful-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing no matter where you go
You don't need a bus pass to break your ass, nigga
Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back with those bitches
Cut the shit, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision.
Times have changed, but fuck it, get a new watch
I still have vision as a line between two points
Young Money is eating, the label gets fat
I'm a bad motherfucker because good guys die young
Everyone selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumbles, everyone wants a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird, the hummingbird doesn't hum
Yes, a lot of money, a lot of money, deep pockets
Money talks and motherfuckers eavesdrop
Lots of bloods, you could call it blood clotting
Eastside, MOB Piru Damu
I'm a blunt hit, polo drawers showing
I-don't-give-a-beautiful-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my teeth glowing, I'm on my Deebowin '
You don't need a bus pass to break your ass, nigga
I do it for money, man, I'm a prostitute
And freedom was my girl, until they took her away
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't want to know, because shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you in that why the fuck?
Motherfucker, ask me why, I say YM
Drop the top, look up and make the sky smile
Young mule, skinny and some supras
I-don't-give-a-beautiful-motherfuck-ass-nigga
With my money growing no matter where you go
You don't need a bus pass to break your ass, nigga
I've been gone too long
Hi Weezy, welcome home.
It's young Mule, baby.
Yes Shawty, you know what I'm talking about
I'm looking at these niggas out there slipping, looking like
They ain't fighting for money no mo man, so uh fuck
You know what we're going to do huh, what we've been doing ha nigga
Let's load, get much more, get much more and say fuck em nigga
Charging on the bitches of mo
So you know what I'm saying, we'll get greedy too nigga
I'm never full
I'm full of blood with this routine
Yeah they don't understand lil nigga
Only key capital murder to survive is to kill
If the elements don't kill you, the riders really will
And niggas know I'm going to the max
Get involved and I have them playing dodgeball with bullets
Yes i have the sawing completely
In Sean John's sweatshirt, fuck you, you play pussy
Ha, we hit them while they watch
And the body shots hurt, but the blows to the head took him
Damn, and if the red dot detects them, then the hollow head catches them
Hit the top of your bottom cat
Yes, you see that we are cool from below
Just to get to the bottom at the bottom of the map
Lil Weezyana piranhas everywhere in
You have to use an extra condom and an extra gat
Your bitch can get it by acting like a man
And niggas in Pakistan ain't packing like your man
Backwards I hand over your man in command
In front of the niggas, cool down with them on the fan
I'm hot, I adjust in different climates
Crouching down from the animal keeper running with my primates
You didn't do it until you did it like in five states
Weezy fat-free hustle I got fat
And in the drought I go on a diet and stretch more
Lose all that weight, leave a black man with stretch marks
You don't even get to a nigga chest for sub par
What the fuck are they playing for at the club?
Real shit, I'm dodging bombs from a drug war
There is no religion, but the police swear that I am a drug trafficker.
Father forgive me if I have to send them to you Lord
They go up the road to the sky boulevard
Damn those niggas pussy and jive
Not even on an eye exam, they are not looking for me
A and K will make your face bend to one side
Because when you go crazy, you're not looking, you're just looking high
Sweet potato nigga, lemon meringue, apple custard
Cherry jelly, don't make me take the cookie
How are you, Gizzle? You my distant brother
Real shit, nigga, same father, different mother
I skip the front and stay to keep it trill
You don't know me for anything else, I'm something else
That the people you feel, I am really deeper, I am deeper than the abilities
My speeches can kill, rest in peace
Yes, are you a brat, Shawty? It's about a nigga thing
If it's money, nigga, come fuck us
If you ain't got no money, stay away from us, nigga
As you like, we can give it to you, nigga
All joggers, bitch, are you an underdig? Put your footprints, nigga
Put your feet down and your nuts on the concrete and let's roll
I'll smash your head to the meat and back to the food
Food to think, think I'm not lying to you
I lied their body in fat, set fire to them
I tie her body in sheets, put the tires on them
Make them feel like the Escalade sets foot on the blades
Curse! I am the heat in the fire
And niggas keep their style when I'm on the street with blay What!
My hungry nigger will eat the plate
And even though he caught me, you can ask that I'm like a pool table
I keep all eight, my side pocket
When I explode, I put a nigger aside for five days
Birdman talks to them
If it's not about money, get and fall in love with me, nigga
Look at my loot, I travel like sound
I'm underground, call me groundhog
Establish laws, call the fundamental law
Don't confuse me with the law, no
But just confuse me with my father because I'm Birdman J.R
I'm not tripping nigga, I play the corner like Ripken nigga
With Cal Ripken's forty blacks, rip a black
Flip your vehicle, split your windshield
I hit you baby mom but I'll let the boy live
And people say that I'm still a child
Cause the lil nigga still travels on big wheels
You feel like an animal, so come and kill
The Sig peel bandanas like bananas
Let's say I'm light bananas that blows a weekend in Havana
In my cabin with my Savannah bitch
Man, a train couldn't stop you, man
I get up and you're not a man, I get up and say I have my land
I'm the man of my land, call him Lil-Weezy-ana
That's the new plan
Silly shit that we fight reach me
Nigga roll alone, dolo nigga
{Verse 1}
Yes
When you see me in the nose, I will probably come in the humble
I'm a storm, I wet my shirts
Also, I'm in the Gulf, so it can get worse
Put my target in her bra, and my burner in her purse
And if there is good cash involved, I am there with you
Cash Money Records nigga, Life After Raw
Capture hard, I have that hard target
Weezy F. Baby, how to say it right
Homie spits out cool bars like Klondike
My 9 right here ... I'm not lying
He can stop the track and let me shoot once if you don't believe me
I am as unpleasant as I did to Carmelo Anthony with the jewels to combine them ...
It looks like a mural on my chest
Two or three strings I plural the best
Yes ... and fresh is how I dress
Floss on a shelf, Lacoste on my set
You know the ankle length, there are no socks with them ...
Aye Stunna, those niggas better pack
Tell them your child will be out front with back
Bitch back
{Verse 2}
And I'm feeling it like a million dollars
No, really like a billion dollars.
Curt Schilling how I throw the dust, in a mist of riders
Still sending kites to lifeguards
I feel like my ice is the brightest
Young black tuned like Midas
Bring death to the fighters
And even that won't bite us nigga don't move us
Our back is glued, we are trapped too
Blood she broke her butt
I pull back in the truck like Sonny in Bronx Tale
Or Gotti on Southside, highly intoxicated, this high
Ridin on the wild side, our side
Tell the law that I'm on a 300 thousand trip
Damn and my seats will be cowhide
I'm so country, my flow hoarse
You should not know the repercussions.
We are fighting as much as po '
Because there is not enough dough to equal us with whites
That's what you need to know
Because that muhfucka needs to go, it's that simple
Yes
I've been
Just me and me oh
I bet the feds probably have a hunch like Quasimodo
Captain in my logo, that's me and my brothers
Promethazine no dose, a recipe for oh oh
Catching all 4 doors, traffic moves too slow
I only come from Cholo, Cholo has that coconut
Even though my iPhone fight explodes
They look for that coconut
I'm never a no-show
I'm bragged by the golden rope
I take out the cash yell "yolo"
Until my throat hurts nigga whoa whoa
I say to my hoe not before my ay, ay
Fuck her until she screams "No more slow down"
And ride like a Volvo [?]
I have keys in this [?] Volvo
I made it to money and it feels like Christmas
I say hoe ho ho ho
Been trapped in the low bass
Just me and me oh
But I bet the feds probably had a hunch like Quasimodo
Trapped in my pole
Trapped in my pole
Trapped in my pole
Captain in my logo
That's me and my brothers
Promethazine a no dose, recipe for oh oh
Promethazine I turn professional, yeah
Look around here you have to mumble
Because these hoes are like dumbo
Boy these hoes cut their throats
Stop talking when you hug
Hoe, this is not a love boat
Smoking like a tug
I go into [?] And go to the gun shop
I'm going to the gun store
I don't fuck with young hoes
This shit is a blood sport
We shoot you in your muscles
And leave you like a puzzle
AK-47 and the girl has a pair
The numbers don't lie, I shoot you a hundred times
Long hair doesn't matter to me
Bitch is Weezy no Rapunzel
I'm in these trees, bitch swinging in the jungle
And I was born there as Tarzan.
They gave me a strong hand
But now they call me Starzan
And I just blew up the bar exam
Penitentiary flows my bars hard
Too difficult for a cellmate
So all these other rappers to me are just bait in jail
Too much coke shakes the skill
It's Lil Tune, also known as Jim
That's what they call you when you sell weight
The feds looking with a rancid face
Hoes looking with the face of Yes
We fuck all night makeup on the pillow
Lil Wayne Tattoo Face
Bad bitch with a cute face
I fuck her and her roommate
Work just arrived today
I break the birds up to [?]
So she left me hotter than a [?] I love you baby
And catching on low low
Just me and me oh
I don't do porn
I only give you the total
All my niggas ain't kidding
The plug calls us crazy
Taking photos like a photo
Trapped in my pole
Trapped in my pole
Trapped in my pole
Promethazine a no dose, recipe for oh oh
Promethazine I'm going professional, I'm going professional
Promethazine I go professional, yes I go professional, yes
Baby mule
Yes
I love you nae nae
One
(Mouse releases track
That will make you get it back, what)
Yes hehe
(Zoooommm)
Tell them yeah bah
Sounds like a live T-Rex under my hood
I have to know that the Tec lives under my seat
I put you down, now you live under my feet
And you better put the 'O' in front of my 'G'
The shit they talk doesn't get to my knee
I'm like a linebacker, don't pass it to me
My two best friends will accompany me
And now they're in my jumpsuit, they sleep
One named Mack, one named Nina
They beat you, they force you to do the Macarena
Where's your tool? You're gonna need it like a motherfucker
Tec, AK, I leave the ugly scene
Chest, head, face, arm, leg, stomach.
Because I have my thang, my thang, my thang
And that bitch goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
You listen to guns like boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
They know I keep that toaster, you can be my pop cake
I never had height, but boy, I have heart
And I don't have to speak, I just let my car speak
Safety helmet? No, but I have the tool on
And you should be my role if the tool is ever drawn, yeah
Flow delay, when I spit I put on the slime
I don't rap, I just shit like a newborn
I don't write, I just spit like a tooth is gone
So tell them that the haters "enough" as a coupon
How does that helicopter sound like a nuclear bomb?
Little nigga, I gotta hold that bitch with two arms
I'm on your heels like a horn
Tec, AK, I leave the ugly scene
Chest, head, face, arm, leg, stomach.
Because I have my thang, my thang, my thang
And that bitch goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
I have to put my rearview mirror when I park in the parking place
Because where I'm from all the young blacks die in the parking lot
Get ten seconds on the news, they hardly talk about us
You have to watch the way you move, they will make an outcha target
Oh the reaper comes, I have to keep him on me
I told my mom that I wouldn't leave her alone
Too much drama, take away these demons
We are still at war, I have that thing at hand
Fuck what happened
That's what my mom told me when they caught me with a ratchet
I'd rather see myself in a cell than see myself in a coffin
I show love to all my fans because I prevail through all this rap, whoa
I feel like I let you down and that's the word for Lil Snupe
I know they would kill me in my neighborhood, but I keep coming
Still with that, the cemetery throwing a party for all the real niggas
When everyone wants me out, we have to deal with it
I saw some things that I could never forget
I just wanna dance a windy summer
Since many of my dogs are sinking
I grew up around those monsters, they'll shoot you in the face
Live by the sword, die by the way of the sword
They tried to get home, they shot him in the hall
The tears on my face feel like I'm crying blood
Mom will never see her son again, we call him blind love
I can't trust these niggas, they'll line you up
You are going to be a murderer or a homicide
Make your mom shed a tear before my mom cries
Only God can judge me when I hold on and let that helicopter sway (Brrr)
I wrote this in blood, this is my truest shit
They say that if he is rich as shit, why is he so militant?
Because in my neighborhood it's not love and I know what I'm facing
As I walk through the valley of the shadows of death
I did some things that I had to regret
I just wanna dance a windy summer
Since many of my dogs are sinking
How I got out alive, sometimes I wonder
Because we've been going to war since Contra
If it doesn't suit him, Shawty, you can call me
Look, I know what to do with all that in those jeans
Got a little loot, it's not like me
Shawty, I know what to do with all that in those jeans
Shawty knows that she has a bad body
Damn baby you're a hottie
Shawty knows that she has a bad body
36-24-36
And girl I really need to know what's up
Hi Ma, I love how your clothes fit like a baby
Word for life the kind to have a baby with
You're half white, so your hair has a wavy bath
But you also mixed with black, so you're crazy
When we met you were hella down
And that's why I took the clear diamonds from you and we yellowed them now
And besides your head so well that you make a young man want to settle down
Hey don't trip when i move here
I can see you trying to sell through that blue c

Damn baby you're a hottie
And girl I really need to know what's up
36-24-36
Damn baby you're a hottie
And girl I really need to know what's up
I said Shawty what it is, tell me what it does
You should thank the Lord God bless you as achoo
36-24-36 are you 22?
Shining like a glittering diamond, it caught me when I saw it
And the next thing you know is that we go in and out of Neiman's
I served it like it was Venus, she hit me back like Serena
I could put her in like Chris
I have never seen a hotty with a body like this
Like her pretty curves, pretty face like a word
She throws it at me. I catch him like Mike Irv.
Something that I love so much could put you somewhere else
Sit in a bubble, become a superstar
Shawty knows that she has a bad body
36-24-36
Damn baby you're a hottie
36-24-36
Damn baby you're a hottie
And girl I really need to know what's up
I'll do anything if you're my girl
Because i will love you for the rest of my life
Look at your sweetest little thing in the whole world
I'll do anything if you're my girl
So don't say don't give me a chance
Because i will love you for the rest of my life
Shawty knows that she has a bad body
36-24-36
Damn baby you're a hottie
And girl I really need to know what's up
36-24-36
And girl I really need to know what's up
I'm chasing my dream
High definition to get what is always given
But nothing ever happened, I built it from scratch
I started with my basement and built my house
I'm rich in opportunities, the money will accumulate
My loot in a hundred thousand, how will the stylist stylize us?
Trapped in the light, trapped in life
I see Youngin in the corner with a quarter of that target
Just trying to chase her dream and her daughter needs some wipes
World full of problems, nobody has to answer
Mommy in the grave, daddy taking drugs
The bills keep rolling, he barely manages
The same clothes every day, barely manages to fly
What is that? Chasin's dreams, time is running, so it seems
In your downtime you are spitting and sick, your flow is bad
He just wants his real chance, no reality show
But the prison cell cemetery, although the reality
Crack House was his birthplace, though the streets spawned him
Woah
Dreamcatcher, keep chasing
The routine will become your shine, be patient
Yes hundreds of miles and running
Try to reach my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin '
Dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher
Uh, I was raised by my mom, pop used to hit her
I have a sister my age, my dad was a cheater
Gram has put something in the pot for us to eat
I had to open the oven for the house to heat up
Christmas missed us, there is no birthday or Easter
Used to snatch bags of tricks or Halloween treats
Hot dogs and beans, fish sticks on the weekend
I shared the same bed my cousin used to urinate on (sick)
Black and white model on top of the floor without cable (uh)
My sister used to hit me, hit me, slap me
Raised in South Phil ', 2-4 where you can find me at
It is used to kick machines during laundry rooms.
Dirty little teenager going to school embarrassed
The routine will become your shine, be patient
Yes hundreds of miles and running
Try to reach my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin '
I'm a dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher
Dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher
It all started in the basement, me, my pen and my pad
Broke like a joke, never laughs
I woke up and went looking for him, and now they're mad forever
When just a year ago I was the same
The guys you call friends are the main ones
But I'm not worried, discouraged, I just watch it
When my dreams began to fall apart, the blacks abandoned
Empty courtroom when my judge read my verdict
Sitting in my cell, watching my dream
Vanish like Mike, fourth quarter, tie
Shackles on my ankles and wrist, my first chains
And now it's hard work on the menu, I'm thirsty, I'm a
Dreamcatcher, keep chasing
The routine will become your shine, be patient
Yes hundreds of miles and running
Try to reach my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin '
Dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher
Dreamcatcher, dreamcatcher
I'm the best of all. I am the most brutal, cruel and ruthless champion that ever lived. There is no one who can stop me. I am Alexander, he is not Alexander. I'm the best of all. There has never been anyone so ruthless. I am Sonny Liston. I'm Jack Dempsey. There's nobody like me. I am of your fabric. There is no one who can match me. My style is brash. My defense is unassailable and I am simply fierce. I want your heart. I want to eat your children. Praise be to Allah!
Yes!
Gangsta Gri-zillz!
There are a lot of bad bitches in the building, amen (amen)
Came into the game killing niggas, J-Lin
When it comes to whips, I'm in shit
I'm probably eight years old (Woo!)
You all niggas come out (come out), all hoes stay inside (stay inside)
Every time I go out (Sale), a movie is being made (Yes!)
Real nigga in all you gotta do is say it
If a nigga rap is failing, when I see it, I'm gonna spray it
Like bang nigga ain't no game (game)
Philly niggas ain't the same, get in your lane (Lane!)
Before the helicopter hits your brain, stay out of the frame (Marco!)
Because when I leave it bada-boom, that's bada-bang
Rollie on my wrist cost a Camaro, yeah double S (Hater!)
Since I made a milli, I still haven't had any problems
Hundreds of piles, hell yeah, hell yeah, fucking good
You all niggas slept on me, I was really awake at night
Tryna chase my dream, now I'm leaving the team
Man, I lean on this Ghost (Skrt!)
"I'm a boss" my hymn (yeah)
MMG my clique, that's why your bitch is on my dick
I have thirty frames in my pocket, I have thirty shots in my clip
I have thirty frames for my verses, you don't get paper like this
I'm getting money, it must be Illuminati
I'm with some blacks from Philly, they're just trying to shoot someone
Tell them (tell them!), I swear I tried to tell them (tell them!)
Lampin 'in this attic, I started from the cellar (Bodega)
And if she wants all that hammer in her, I'm going to nail her
Word to my nigga, Ricky, let's kill the game this summer
Ahh!
Said you knew a black man with a hundred bricks
So let's climb on them, slide on them with their sticks
Finna appears in her crib as a damn magic trick
Hocus-focus, to the safe like you as nigga open focus
But this ain't Calvin niggas, riding like a locomotive
Pussy ass niggas man it's tax season
Act decent, bet the gaps leave your back dripping
Niggas lookin 'for the coke like we cracked pretending
Young niggas get greasier than Vaseline
I had a dream, I'm going to chase it with this Mac machine
Put a nigga on the cover of a magazine
Invasion of the house, the news newspaper has a fallen man
Hold this nigga's legs, I'm going to tie his hands
Let them try it, just to know we're not playing
He doesn't have to get down on his knees, black head
Blocka! You're fucking with a shotta
I'm hitting 2Pac, "My Ambitionz As A Ridah"
And we're going to rinse everything if those boys back us up
Because we are not going home, I am in another area
Ridin 'with my dogs, we just want another bone
I'm not getting to the money, nigga, so there's something wrong
You see, dreaming is an occupation
That is an exclusive membership
Such as: Rozay, Khaled, Karen Civil, Lou Will, Joey I.E.
I mean of course I'm a member
It is never too late to join
Please! Submit a request any day
Do you remember the last one?
I told you, start with a thought
What happens after that is up to you
Dreams and nightmares ahead!
Quality ... Street ... Music!
And so ... We left!
Isn't this what you were expecting?
Are you ready?
I used to pray for times like this, it rhymed like this
In a matter of time I spent in shit locked up
See how my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said "Yes I do"
If you want you have to see it with a clear view
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga, please, before the grip triggers
I'm getting cream, never let the hoes get in the way
From what we started, lil 'nigga, but I got a lion heart
They love me when I was trapped and they hated me when I left
I go and get it independently, draw it like I'm an artist
Without crawling, I went straight for a walk with foreign cars in my garage
Anything for a dollar, they tell me to get them, I have them
I did it without an album.
Lil nigga, I'm on fire
Frozen like a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flying
When I bought the Rolls Royce, they thought it was leased
Ghost so big it doesn't even fit in the parking spot
You're not talking about my niggas, so what are you talking about?
The gangs move in silence, nigga and I don't talk much
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
I was in my routine and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga
Wait, wait a minute, did you think it was over?
When I bought that Aston Martin, did you think it was rented?
Flexing these niggas, I'm like Popeye with his spinach
I'm the type that counts a million cash and then I work like I'm bankrupt
That Lambo, my new bitch, she will ride like my Ghost
I'm hanging around my city with my hands tied to my toes
Cause these niggas want me dead and I have to go home
These niggas tryna take my life, fuck and die
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't screw around, no kidding
All I know is murder, when it comes to me.
I got young niggas rolling, I got niggas pulling B
I did the DOA I did the KOD
Every time I'm in that bitch I can throw 30 G's
They like it, my nigga at home, that that young nigga is wild
We're young niggas and we complain like Batman and we're Robin
This 2-door Maybach, with my seat reclined
I'm that real nigger, what's up, nigga real, what's up
If you're not about that murder game then nigga fuck shut up
If you bother me in your raps, I'll stick your ass
When you land in my neighborhood, no, that life on tour is not good
Catch me at MIA, in that Heat on wood game
With that life of Puma on my feet, like that little motor that I could
Boy I slide down your block, bike at twelve o'clock
And they're throwing deuces at the same nigga they see
And I'm the king of my city because I still call them shots
And these lame talking about that shit are the same niggas who failed
And these niggas hate me hoes wait for me
Still in that hood shit, my Rolls Royce on E
They will remember me, I say remember me
So much money has your friends turned into enemies
And with these cattle I turn my enemies into memories
With them, the bricks go over 40, there are not 10, a key, wait
Black broke, get rich, love the game like Mitch
What if I leave you do you think they are cute hoes that still suck my dick?
It was something Rollie was about when he touched my wrist the first time.
I left
Court
Isn't this what you were expecting?
So I had to grind like this to shine like this
In the back of the truck with fists clenched at the wrists.
As my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said "Yes I do"
If you want you have to see it with a clear view
I have a shorty, she tries to bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga, please, before the grip triggers
I'm getting cream, never let the hoes get in the way
They love me when I was trapped and they hated me when I was leaving
I go and get it independently, draw it like I'm an artist
Without crawling, I went straight for a walk, with foreigners in my garages
All the foreign bitches are mixing, fucking, sucking and swallowing
Anything for a dollar, they tell me to get them, I have them
I did it without an album.
I screwed up with Mariah
When I bought the Rolls Royce, they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hate, rest in peace
Hate, rest in peace, rest in peace in the parking lot
Ghost so big it doesn't even fit in the parking spot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
I was in my routine and now I have what I deserve, fuck nigga!
Maybach music
Flexing these niggas, I'm like Popeye with his spinach
Double M, yes, that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm a lieutenant
That Lambo, my new bitch, she doesn't ride like my Ghost
I'm hanging around my city with my hand tied to my toast
Cause these niggas want me dead and I have to go home
These niggas tryna take my life, fuck, they die
You fuck, you fuck, you fuck, you smoke
'Cause these Philadelphia niggas that I brought with me don't screw around, no kidding, no
All I know is murder, when it comes to me.
I got young niggas rolling, I got niggas pulling B
I did the DOA, I did the KOD
Every time I'm in that bitch, I can throw 30 G's
But now I'm hanging that fallen head, I'm getting closer to Collins (Skrrt)
They let my nigga Ern come home, that young nigga be wild (Come on)
I'm like, "Real nigga, what's up? Real nigga, what's up?"
If you hit me in your raps, I'll stick you in the ass
When you land in my neighborhood, no, that life on tour is not good
Catch me at MIA in that Heat game on wood
Boy I slide down on your block (Block), bike at 12 o'clock (Rah)
And they're throwing deuces at the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)
And these cowards who talk that shit are the same niggas who failed
I'm the same Berks Street nigga with those diaper braids, that lock
The same nigga that appeared and I had to wait for my place
And these niggas hate me hoes wait for me
Still in that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They will remember me, I say remember me
So much money, make your friends give themselves to your enemies
And when there is meat, I turn my enemies into memories
With them bricks go for 40, there is no 10 a key
And if I go, do you think those cute hoes are still going to suck my dick?
It was something Rollie touched my wrist for the first time.
It made me feel like that silly boy when he first touched that brick
I left
Court!
(Remnant)
Yes
The young black man started with noodles and noodles, now we are eating lobster (Ah)
As I walk down the valley with my ladder and flex
I'm the truest nigga I just rapped on
When everyone thought we were done, they laughed at that.
So I went and bought myself a [??] and turned my ass back
Fuck it, new jewelry, new whips on the way now
Brr, brr, that's your bitch on the way now
Mom told me that if you fell, never stay down
Get up nigga, I can never lie down
Win and lose, comes with being bosses
Shoot a nigga in his head if he crosses our path
Put that shit to the test if the feds make offers
Little bitch, don't call me little fish
Niggas try to turn off my lights, I'm still lit
Streets calling and they said it was real shit
Young bull looking like a lick
I got too many aliens, man, this shit is getting bored
Come on let's get it
Ya nigga my album is coming
Dreams are worth more than black money
I've been making a lot of money, nigga nigga
I think I took a year off
Many niggas fall down
We are doing nothing but being stronger blacks
New offers, new money, double M G Dreamchaser
Let's get it
If they make your bail a thousand, you will come home tonight
I went from standing on their corners, jumping on them flights
Jungle middle without leash, ice
Niggas pussy in the dark, let's turn on the lights
I used to sleep on the same floors as mice
Rest in peace for Mike, rest in peace the microphone
I show up a couple of perches, I drink that Easter Sprite
Your levels to this shit, dog, you won't believe my life
62 Maybach, I can hardly park the shit
I got these rappers scared, I see them tremble like Parkinson's
If they said my name they caught fire, I'm the arsonist
A man does not eat, he will starve, a man will starve, he will die
I know they will give it a try, that's why I'm keeping a new Mac and it's 45
So when they jump fast, they better whistle offside
Because I'm from Philly, we'll eat your cheese steak
I said to Diddy, I'm not going to walk without cheesecake
Because the jeweler making the band with his face frozen
Let's talk about the time when I used to go through that
Diaper braids, with cold pulls
We were playing with razors before they had the scooters
Shit, I walked in with my Cougars on, you don't even know it
This pair of million dollar black sneakers, you don't even know it
Said Reebok dropped Ross, we don't even know.
Because he went and brought that Bentley Brookland, he didn't even show it
At 21 I wanted to blow up a bottle
At 22 I wanted the sexiest model
At 23 I wanted the Rolls-Royce
I hit my hood, niggas look fucking sour
They see me rolling and I'm like a fucking coward
I just want to dance, spend the quarter with you
Just look at my car, you don't remember that I starved
I want it all
All that hate that I made disappear
I mess you back to A
Put the verse like Mac hitting your face
And Philly nigga, I'm mac in the bay
I'm out of rhythm still killing shit, I'm talking all over the street still killing shit
Hurricane the first week, I still killed the shit
The intro has come out like a year and it's still killing shit
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Yes Yes Yes
You can hit my line if you need me (Ayy)
Stars in your eyes when you see me (Ayy)
Food to think, not at all

Uh, I'll be there for you, believe me if I swear to you
You gave me everything now my imperial love, play
It's dripping, with shit or not
We hit the place, I hit your place, I hit you with this Glock
That pussy okay, I'm trying to kill, like I'm an opp
Just to let you know what time it is
I will break your heart, as if there were no promises, I promise you
"Do you love her? Treat her like me", that's what my mom said
For real
You can hit my line if you need me (Ayy)
Stars in your eyes when you see me (Ayy)
I drip a lot, I check the time on my watch

Sliding down the pole, then busting it
I want to bite, she is the sweetest, kisses

I know a couple niggas from the neighborhood want to break up with me
And put me on a RIP shirt and memory
So I'm riding with a drum on the Glock
In the gram, the niggas said they couldn't come to my block

Hundred and six shots stop and park niggas
Jump on the big button to start nigga
The murder was the case they gave us.
Real niggas back in style they should thank us
All these rap ass niggas really wanksters
Real recognize how real you are a stranger
Hoes sell their souls for some baller alert
Blacks and fake jewelry need a fraudulent alert
Put me on my guard, tell them what it's worth
I bet they say couple Audemar milli with the works
New crash called Call Big Meech
Every time I drop hot fish shit

Still getting this money, they think we got them birds
Every time I spit that's a thousand words
Nigga we chose, we were chosen
I Omelly had them hoes now on their Rollses
Screaming back to back they told you the blacks owed us
And they said they would expose us, they never showed us
I have enemies, I have many enemies
They were just cooling off with me hating to call them friends
Because if I lose my cool I could turn them into memories

The bratty bitches, the niggas jobs
Clean my ass with the riches like it's toilet paper
Fuck with a winner, minks in winter
Philadelphia millionaire, meek be that nigger
I niggas hating, my niggas dancing
Poppin 'bands, counting dollars, buying Magnum bottles
We both woke up that Sunday morning
Can I ask you a favor?
Please accept that Meek is just that boy now!
Why fight against that?
You are doing yourself a bad service
This is how we like to fuck
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck
Face down, ass up
This is how we like to fuck
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck
I have the pussy on my mind and I have the boss in my glass
And I got on the line trying to do the "you know what"
And I don't have to say anything, you know that I deviate if you know her
Because I don't play, I'm not at all, and killing them hoes is 2 against 1
I take her home, I touch her, you take her home and you're going to clear
Because you guys are going to kick it, and about my business
But I'm like face down and your ass up and your ass up and your face down
Just breathe ho, breathe ho
Look, I took a rubber out of my pocket and never slipped.
Bad bitch, she looks tropical, if she fucks me right now, she's buying
In fact, I'm lying, I'm so screwed up like I'm flying
I have advantages in my system, I tell hoes when I get them, put your
Face down, ass up
This is how we like to fuck
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck

Face down, ass up
This is how we like to fuck
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck
I'm in your neighborhood, I probably fucked your ho
These bitches are nasty, I need them to lick my nuts
These bitches know I got that deep in your gut cock
Face down, with the back arched, the fingers separate that butt
And I'm deep into it and she drips, breaks a couple of nuts and then sleeps
Aren't you trying to run to where that pussy goes?
Like cray on the day of the week, weekend your 3 friends
And I'm so deep inside when I come in, pussy feeling something like the ocean
I'm on it and I get Finna to send another black bitch back, wait
I am unpleasant and I know that
I big ass so throw that, yeah bitch throw that, throw that
Wait, wait, my dick wobbled
Deep throat, vomit bad bitches you know what? I love you
Face down, ass up
This is how we like to fuck
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck

Face down, ass up

Bad couple independent woman in my section
You're cheating on dollars, I don't even pay attention
And yes I'm popping bottles (true) and I don't think it's a problem (true)
So just wait, let me open up with this ganja
Face down, ass up, or do you think you are all of that
Because when I treat you the way I treat you and leave you, you will need bathrooms
Now we had Magic and Onyx trying to see what was going on
Trust me, I throw this back, broke it like this Peter Pan
See the plan come alone or go home
And if you act like you don't know, play this damn song
Face down, ass up
This is how we like to fuck
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck
This is how we like to fuck
There are some hoes in this house trying to fuck
Look when I do joints like this
I do it for the youth in the ghetto.
That ... never listen to the story because he will make me tell you
I want to woo all day, the prosecutor says he hates me
How are you going to hate me when Lu and I take twenty shelves?
And put a cost on the kids
Twenty-four, how could I ask for more?
I got my deal, it's getting real, I'm making money for sure
Stuntin every chance I get 'cause I had it poor
But every time I go to sleep I hear the devil at my door
And I'm in those papers, so the courts go back and forth
Moms become zombies from that crude because it's abundant crack
You wonder why those babies run wild clapping
Gaining life before the pussy is taken
Because there is no one who loves them, so their lives are taken
Locked in cages they have them fighting over cookies
And lunch trays, happy that the days never kill me
Yes i remember it was a hot december
Niggas die in the height of winter because kids need them toys
But Santa Claus doesn't see boys or girls around here.
Tryna gets her shit back because she feels the world owes her
And her daughter wants a Barbie bicycle for Christmas
Just her and her little brother there
We wash our pain with Belvedere
And use the drugs that brought us here
We get high, hot dogs without ribs
Where tears drip from red eyes
Where extremes don't meet deadlines
He gives. He said he hates me but I don't understand
When I just shook a show in front of fifty thousand fans
I think that racist bitch probably on The Klan
She took the pain away from me but she probably needs a man
I took my mother from public housing, I put her on the canes
We went a long way from wellness and getting W.I.C
I know they want to hit me because I'm dancing
That bitch says she hates me, I felt something like that
Last night we went out giving three hundred salaries
She was only in schools for girls and boys basketball teams
Why you hate me, you hate me because I'm doing it and I'm supposed to
And I'm making more money than you
But bitch you can hate me for that
Let's get it
Yes
Sad to say but I love you
Don't be offended but you're my bitch
Yeah you fell every time a nigga calls you
That's why I play as a game when I pamper you
We were in Miami, the first time I saw you
I was in a ghost when I stopped you
It was late at night, late at night on the side
And you keep it hidden so you really understand
You were there through my ups and downs like a camel
Fat ass says she got it from her mom
She just wants the money, she's not fucking without bloggers
Fuck you in a PC all the way to the Bahamas
Gucci, Valentino, darling, I can be your stylist
Fuck me with your friend, yeah, yeah, you were crazy
1942 shots make you a monster
Thuggin 'like you 2Pac, you know I got you
I love the way you ride it, move your hips like you Rihanna
I was supposed to hit, I was never supposed to handcuff you
I put you in my house because he says he wants to fuck you
When he asked me about you, I said I love you
But now it's quiet for you, because I told him that I loved you
You fell every time a nigga calls you
That's why I play as a game when I pamper you
I was in a ghost when I stopped you
It was late at night, late at night on the side
Fucking you good I got you bustin 'like you Rambo
And you keep it hidden so you really understand
You were there through my ups and downs like a camel
I was locked up, I remember when I hit you
He used to write me every letter that I sent you
You weren't my girl but you used to pretend
When I got home, let me beat you instrumental
Lame left you scarred, so I had to reinvent you
If you were a car, shit, you drive it like a Benz
Wait with the stars, every time I come looking for you
Let's go hard every time you on that chicken too
I have another bitch and you told me I could have her
I know you were sick so I bent over to grab you
You fell every time a nigga calls you
That's why I play as a game when I pamper you
We were in Miami, the first time I saw you
I was in a ghost when I stopped you
It was late at night, late at night on the side
Fucking you good I got you bustin 'like you Rambo
And you keep it hidden so you really understand
You were there through my ups and downs like a camel
Whoa, she just wants a ride with a shotta, though
Although I am an original gift given
Tear them all down like dominoes
Let me tell you other bitches, let's go
Whoa, good girl, bad girl, small town, crazy world
She just wants to shine, whoa
And last night it was real crazy, umbrellas, advils, fuck you all the time
You fell every time a nigga calls you
We were in Miami, the first time I saw you
I was in a ghost when I stopped you
It was late at night, late at night on the side
Fucking you good I got you bustin 'like you Rambo
And you keep it hidden so you really understand
You were there through my ups and downs like a camel
I'll be getting money fucking hoes
Many things about me wherever I go
If you're on the other side, then you have to go
Bruce Lee Roy, I have the shine
Hundreds of bands on me wherever I go
I keep my bitch on Celine, that's fa sho
I keep my hittas on the plane, that's fa sho
And the streets know my names, that's fa sho, sho
I've been making money under my breath
Black guy buy a Birken for your hoe
A hundred thousand in me wherever I go
Fuck you niggas, the talking shit is on
Dirty Riding Got The Helicopter On The Bent
I got your baby mama trying to get a movie
Now nigga, tell your baby mom to fuck his dick
I'm just getting cold with my young niggas
She in the VIP with all these drug dealers
Acting like I never fucked up with you
And she told me that you're a fucking black
Mixing that Givenchy with Valentino camouflage
Touchdown, yes, hoe
I'll be getting money fucking hoes
Hundreds of bands on me wherever I go
Many things about me wherever I go
If you're on the other side, then you have to go
Bruce Lee Roy, I have the shine
The diamonds that dance on my chain come from Joe
Hundreds of bands on me wherever I go
Many niggas hate but keep it low
I keep my bitch on Celine, that's fa sho
I keep my bitch on Vera Wang, that's fa sho
I keep my hittas on the plane, that's fa sho
Yes, harassing in the clear port
Therefore, I am more flying than an air force
Looking devilish, I stop at that red Porsche
Now we got your bitch on the money train
I heard her fucking her name and her name
We only know his wife by her Twitter name
Feel the pain, feel the pain, make them feel the flame
All these cheesy niggas winners, I don't know who to blame
But maybe it's the internet, I've been busy counting money, you should do the same
Every nigga around me has a body
Shorty with me trying to kick him like karate
In my DM acting thirsty, word to Gotti
I'll be getting money fucking hoes
Hundreds of bands on me wherever I go
Many things about me wherever I go
If you're on the other side, then you have to go
Bruce Lee Roy, I have the shine
The diamonds that dance on my chain come from Joe
Hundreds of bands on me wherever I go
Many niggas hate but keep it low
I keep my bitch on Celine, that's fa sho
I keep my bitch on Vera Wang, that's fa sho
I keep my hittas on the plane, that's fa sho
And the streets know my names, that's fa sho, sho
I'm still playing, the money keeps calling
Flood the entire band, looks like real water
Ticket after ticket I feel like I'm going to call
Niggas hates me, I don't feel for them
'Cause my South Philly niggas kill at will for them
And my North Philly niggas do the exercise for them
The lawyers who paid nigga made me spend a million on them, damn it!
Hundreds of bands on me wherever I go
Many things about me wherever I go
If you're on the other side, then you have to go
Bruce Lee Roy, I have the shine
The diamonds that dance on my chain come from Joe
Hundreds of bands on me wherever I go
I keep my bitch on Celine, that's fa sho
I keep my bitch on Vera Wang, that's fa sho
I keep my hittas on the plane, that's fa sho
And the streets know my names, that's fa sho, sho
These niggas don't want it on us, they're pussy
Philly!
Posted in the trenches, all my chains on
Probably riding alone with your main jaw
Louboutin's kicks don't have a stain on them
Finger on my head, I call it brainstorming
She is going to suck me while I wobble the Wraith
You'll be in your hood without feeling safe
Stacking the money, trying to fill the safe
I will never come home, I take another case
Crimes, my niggas have serious crimes
I had that white girl showing up when niggas sold trees
And when we were selling trees, those busting like bumble bees
Oh never love hoes, I've been going in and out
If you need the job, know my nigga got it
Caught twenty-eight by thirty-six
It's cooking right in front of you like Benihana
Blowing fast money, blowing fast money
Running through the bag, running through the bag
When you come out of nowhere, fuck be humble
Fuck, be humble, fuck, be humble
Tell them I'm tied up, I don't want to rumble
Fuck, be humble, fuck, be humble
Fuck be humble when you're in the 'Rari
I pulled and caught him like he was Dez Bryant
Chain Roc Nation, all these damn diamonds
I feel like I'm Michee before I go to jail
Fucking Atlanta every time I hit him
Mixing that Givenchy with the YSL
Last time I checked, it was that fucking black
Make yourself evident and we're chasing money and never women
Blowing fast money, blowing fast money
Running through the bag, running through the bag
Blowing fast money, blowing fast money
When you come out of nowhere, fuck be humble
Tell them I'm tied up, I don't want to rumble
Fuck, be humble, fuck, be humble
When you come out of nowhere, fuck be humble
Fuck, be humble, fuck, be humble
Tell them I'm tied up, I don't want to rumble
Fuck, be humble, fuck, be humble
Snippet lyrics
... wake up and bathe, oh yeah
Bitch, your fake Rollie, it's cloudy in the face
All I am concerned about is money and dripping all day
Ridin 'rich, all a nigga does is cry all day
D.E.P....
The lyrics of this song have not yet been released. Check back once the song has been released.
First of all I want to say it's free my nigga Lil
And set my black Rick free
And just thinking about making life gave me chills
Damn, long climb to the mountains
I heard a black soul make you want to cry fountains
But you can not
So much pain can't explain or pronounce it
And daydream the day you get home but you never know
When those cookies will set you free
Take off the chains and let yourself be
You know you get appeal
Many laws lie in the field
Delivered to the system either that or they were killed
Man, I'm not in a hurry because I want to shit, I have to
I fell in love with the streets, I also lost my dad
At a young age, man, I was doing shit to take me to an early grave
Or put me in the cage
Because I don't know that the world becomes slow
And time flies by fast trying to travel until you crash
I said I couldn't choose a good or bad side because being bad felt good and being good is not money
Running on the streets made my mom go crazy
Hanging out in South Philly, where my dad doesn't make it
To catch a nigga slipping like a taurus transmission
Listen man, the streets that I come from black
A nigga take one of yours and then you come tied to him
Squeeze the trigga and leave them out
See you got the demons in the corner
Looking like zombies
Youngin 'was only 19 got hommy
Yesterday they left him on the streets with a brain soaked
Live ride or pride by the gun
40 on my hip (8X)
Get hit with all that, they will be like a flamer (4X)
Go to the head, nigga, take a hit with all that
Call that ambulance, see your body, give the call back
How to call the coroner, that dead nigger
I paint the pavement with your blood, purple blue, burgundy red
Black is talking recklessly, they scare
They're all southern gangsters, cowards, and they call the feds
How are the niggas going against me, all the north side knows I'm G
To get a pass, you will need an ID to pass
Black pussy looking askance like I don't want him
about to be broadcast to the max, like Nike
Nigga shooting from a block away, and don't goad me
If they weren't through with me, just tell them to come walk to me
I put a little to do more
OT mobile circle how to connect four
I'm really in the mix, I've been around vets
Out Pittsburgh killing them 40 right on the objects
Now Bucky got them P under his breath
They cost 11 5 to take a dollar if it's slow
I've never been a fraud, I don't fight for a ho
And when that meat happens, all my niggas know is to go
I've been around for a while, some niggas will say I'm fine
I charge you for a verse, don't tell me I'm Hollywood, I'm fine
Connect dealing with more squares than small [?]
I bet he spins it, get hit by it all
I hit you with that 40 makes you do the Macarena
And my watch will be in bling bling
I clean it up, I'll be on my scene cool thing
Seven on my butt and my feet what [?] Thing
Ching Ching, all I have is money on my mind
Bing Bing, they slapped me hollow on my nine
It is the same, I am in my grizzy in my routine
And I shoot them until my cookie rests
Just to send a message, fuck and kill your son first
I am the definition of danger
Being hit with all that, like I'm a flamer
You're not living like I live, suck
That's why I flex niggas who never loved us
I'm putting checks on niggas, even my son's mother
And you're not real if you're going to let the children suffer
Niggas killed your cousin and you did nothing
I could murder these niggas like I'm gonna win something
But they don't make war for it
There are friends with double-edged knives who put swords on their backs
Velor is black, Balenciagas in I'm tied
And I don't party in those clubs where informants
And conspire with their whispering people
It has no realer
Sixteen with a body he's a murderer
Running with a stick like Donatello
Man these niggas gonna murder for that chedder
Hommies killing hommies on demon paper
Hommies killing hommies on slanted paper
There must be the real nigga Grammys
Where we buy Rollies and treat them like trophies
You will never understand me
You don't come from where I come
Niggas on Xannies, mommy on crack how we gonna feed the family
Might as well start selling it, all inhaling
Young, black and smart what they should have told us
But they locked us in a cell with a stranger to raise us and wonder why we rebelled.
Niggas going through pain
I was missing school because I was going through things
Niggas drives me crazy, they threw it all down for fame
Tear down schools in my city to run a prison
They killed Chinx Drugz in his own city.
Lil Snupe was killed in his own city.
I wonder why I'm not in my own city
I still live lavishly and still wonder why I act wild
All these weapons and automatics
I'll still murder these niggas who want to have it
Fuck all the niggas that killed Lil Snupe
And when we meet all of you niggas we'll kill them too
I still pray that every young black man feels that coupe
Because young blacks feel like me, I feel like you
Fifty shades of gray, you want to make me like Freddie
I pray to God, load my helicopter, tell them niggas I'm ready
Summer nights and we bring you bikes
You could turn off the lights cause we got all this ice out
We are here going crazy
Young boys get to the [?]
Looking at the media they say I have a baby
Along the way for Nicki, I'm thinking the media is crazy
Young black man reaching for the money
Dreams are worth more than money, it's not funny
Then I bought a Rolls Royce because I came out of the bottom, they gave me no other option
The judge gave me five months in jail, I felt I was in hell.
Twenty three was in the cell
Excuse your honor if you were too arrogant, that money was amazing
They blocked my PC with them, transsexuals and rats, man, that shit was embarrassing
Twenty-three hours in the cell alone, man, you can't imagine
Can you imagine me losing my mind?
Doing 52 push-ups at once
Make the whole deck just to pass the time
Just to go back to my son and back to my mother
Because Daddy keeps asking me where I am
I told him in jail and I said that he would come back.
He said when you come back can you get me out of school?
We live fast, we die from gunshots
And in this lifestyle we throw drugs, Glocks bust
Why do you think we say fuck police?
Because when they lock us up, all the fun stops
And when the ice cream truck comes it won't stop
So for them little babies, all the fun stops
Waiting on the state bus until the handcuffs close
They put shackles on us like jewels, we say "fuck rocks"
Because all we ever wanted was to sell blocks
To get some real estate to sell blocks
And try to turn to God when these cells are locked
Have mercy on me, land, catch a case trying to sell rock
And we didn't want to believe that hell is hot
My mom told me you could also stop
Because you can't bear your weight when the pits fall
And your shit reeked of mold
In the kitchen like a grandmother
When it comes to getting this money, fuck it all up without playtime
If you're a real nigga, you don't care
Real niggas, we can't die
I used to pray to God for a black brick
He prayed to God to be a rich black
Timing is everything
I love all my niggas and my family is loyal
I buy everything
Take Papi to college and everything
I go out of my way to get out of my way
I give my mom a thousand a day
Like Benihana, we are cutting the weight
Because we get that job and save the profits
How would you feel if you came out of nowhere and a hundred thousand just a comma away?
My youngins got youngins who entered the game
Because we were trapped when the doctor was Dre
Rollie diamond face
Wait, look how I just took this bitch, take her straight to the mall and take her shopping
Wait, what you want, some red backgrounds
Balenciagas [?]
Shit, I'm about to stick his head out
I got her twerking for a nigga who's cardio
I could kill all these rappers on audio
Pick it up I forgot how that goes
None of you niggas scared my heart, we're just afraid to break
And none of you niggas scared my heart, we cut your head down your throat
I would never hang with fools and rats, unless it's a chair and a rope
Millions of dollars dreaming, I was really up to
Feeling like a [?] When I'm out of tilt
I said why you talk, we don't come and go with niggas, I feel like I'm Venus
Nigga filled sands, I get down to my level
I heard you say you drove the city and I saw you in traffic and niggas walked
Nigga, are you hating because you're crazy? Are you crazy because you are hating?
Because you stay in those days, I'm not waiting to debate
I'm getting to that money
I'm reaching that mule
Wherever you see me I have a handle on
I'm on some shit actually
Caddy [?] Like Reynolds Wrap
'About to put some duces on like I'm playing [?]
And I could go to the mall and tell them to give me that
Hippie clothes of different colors
I want to grab it
Even let my bitch do stunts
Gucci hat sandles in
I even have the bag for that
Change the matter flow fact
Wait when i roll
I have enemies as if you knew what
He's not stunting, he's just up front
I'm like a man who is nothing
I have to Flamers on the road 3
Movie deal is coming up I'm about to be a millionaire
I'm only still young, I'm not 25 yet
And I'm a damn bomb threat
Niggas ain't no contest
Forty-five compact, with the extender
Hollow heads cut an enemy like wood
Catch me in the Caran Cranberry, running down the boulevard
I drop a bird on the street and I do a somersault
North Philadelphia Mike Knox Meek Milly
Getting so much money that these enemies want to kill me
Look like a gentleman
Who's in my passenger seat, oh that's my friend
I only do 8 or 10, 7 when I'm on my dick
Me and Prada have it, the girl has a body [?]
Then I send her back to the lobby, pimping is just a hobby
I'm limping because I'm a G and my so green
The stripper just can't believe, I'm throwing him into the air
It's everywhere as Rosé leaves me
Inside we are thirty deep, too much for the VIP
My bracelet all [?] My hands remain on your fabric
I'm going like the breeze
Aye Meek, you know what I mean
How these niggas want me now
Is this what you want?
They don't stray, Flamers 2.5
Although you guys were getting 3, you still haven't
October 20, Flamers 3
215 nigga affiliate
We are receiving money
I want this shit forever
I just shot two videos
Make them say hottest in town
Get ready nigga
Flamers 3 hottest in the country of America
That's what we'll call it
We don't call it 2.5 no more
Let's call it 2.25
Straight to the damn [?]
Street banger nigga
I said you would be where the lame would be where I was appearing
Money, cars, clothes and hoes, yes, I have a lot of that
Hates talking 'dirty' about the boy we are not buying
Bitches throw Trynna pussy fuck me, where's the condom?
See I'm zeeming trying to keep my semen I'm not wrong with that
Crazy little bitches wanna have my baby
Because the Ben Franklin bank account was maybe
My president is black, my Glock is too
Announcement, I probably put a padlock on a block near you
I say my niggas get the drop, they're gone for air
I was never afraid of what, what you heard fear whom.
I can see with a clear view that you fuck guys is pussy
And I'm calm, but all you have to do is push me
And my thugs wish they'd bury a nigga
I just give the word and push your shit back as a preliminary
Spit is fictional
I'm so threshing swinging through the jungle like a gorilla
Niggas sleeping on you cause you're softer than a pillow
Cold pussy talking recklessly like a killer and all this for the bitches
Play with choppas with extenders
I'm a boss, tell him to quit and get the business
Fuck all of you? I mean...
I'm going hard for the damn city I grew up in, nigga
You know what drama is going to tell them
Gangsta!
How did my mother pay the bills when these jobs are not hired?
The metal keeps shooting, the hood is getting tired (x2)
Tryna feeds the children, the narcos hit us like lighting
My young boy of 17 took a 20 to 40
By the time he turns 20, my son will be 40
He called me yesterday, he said he was begging, they caught him
I couldn't beat it, the defendants told our lawyer
I do not spit for children, spit as it is
Why would I tell you something different? this is how i live
How I Got Junkies Shooting Their Brains
Niggas letting things break everywhere
I heard the nigga killed my father, he still walks these streets
So what the hell do you think happened? Did he enter me?
Enter the murder, Glock walking the 33
Because when that nigga kills my pop, it's like he killed me
The nightmares of the northern state dream of getting rich
All they're looking for is clothes trying to get a whip
These boys think you're good if you make it
And how did you feed your children if you received an offer?
But I can't blame them, it's the same shit I did
I know who is close to you, I want to make you more
In some Rico shit, my nigga is 21 and got hit by Rico
For the love of green and the American dream
For the love of money seen hysterical things
Niggas will serve her own moms if she asks for a beam
Flamers Haha drama I have them I have them beasts
I know you'll be where the lame are, I'll be where I'm exploding
Money, cars, clothes and hoes, yes, I have a lot of dhat
40 you should clean them, soak them like a laundry
Bitches throwing pussy trynna f * ck me, where the condom?
My president is black, my Glock is two years old and I probably put a padlock on a block near you
I let my niggas get the drop, dey gon they dropped you, I was never afraid of what
What Chu heard fear who
I can clearly see that f * ck boyz is pussy and I'll be calm but all you have to do is push me
And my goonz is wishing that they deny me a nigga, I just give the word and push your shit back like paliminary
Nigga, didn't you hear, I'm talking a word like a dictionary, shit, spitting is fictitious
I'm as threshing swinging through the jungle as gorilla bananna clip pealer
Niggas sleeping on you cause you're softer give a pillow
Ol pussy talking reckless like a murderer and giveaways are for bitches
The relics of the snitches we play with revolvers play with choppas with extenders
Let it rock
Flamers!
Yes, it's your son Meek, Milly's son of a bitch
You know that's all I have
Giving you niggas what the fuck are you waiting for
You know what I mean?
Why do you hate me when all the hood is waiting for me?
I'm Harriet Tubman for these little underground niggas
And it's not rap, I don't have anyone holding my shit
Cause I got all the hot shit, and there's no need for that
Shoutout to all my niggas
It's not shit, but I don't need it
You know what I mean, it's your boy Meek Milly
Free my nigga Lil
Flamers!
Stuntin 'everything on my old hoes, styling everything on my enemies
Presidential is rose gold, let's say it's time to get some paper
Every month it bothers me, fuck with those papers
So i can't smoke no kush, i can't smoke no kush
But I ran into the hoes, and I'm not talking about Reggie Bush
I say you guys fuck niggas so bend over, hoes never gonna look
In the kitchen with that pyrex and 9 pieces, let me cook
Now wait, I went and bought a Phantom because I wanted to
And now I drive the same as some stunners
Real nigga, 100 tests
I need 100m to make me comfortable
Stuntin 'everything on my old hoes, styling everything on my enemies
Presidential is rose gold, let's say it's time to get some paper
Large crib without neighbors, hard ball but without Lakers
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these niggas
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these bitches
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these bitches
All I know is just flex, shitting on my ex
Bad hoes on my team, dick 'em down like Next
I rock YSL so cool, fly like hell without jet
She says I'm arrogant, I say that's not me
She calls me daddy and I say come here
Wristband in hockey, Porsche box like Ali
My sneaks go bally, in my hood I'm prolly rolling in that ghost
Beware of them friends
Heater on my hip, trunk full of that work
I say my shooters like Dirk, 10 racks and you in the dark
I put it on your head nigga, the first week and your dead nigga
I bottle pop, I model pop
Pick up the bikes, let the throttle explode
Niggas knows I'm nice, and I got so much
Like fuck your corner, I buy the block
Stuntin 'everything on my old hoes, styling everything on my enemies
Presidential is rose gold, let's say it's time to get some paper
Large crib without neighbors, hard ball but without Lakers
I passed 100 racks on my chain, they all know my name
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these niggas
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these bitches
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these niggas
I don't chase bitches, I just chase my dreams
We're spinning so dirty in this whip that it's so clean
My old head, she's 30 but that dick is so bad
And that pussy so good for that pipe, she's my devil
In that pint I just lean, the advantage made me double
If you're not talking about money, you don't make sense
I smell it on my clothes, work has that smell
In that kitchen with them birds, 'about to serve that's a roar' - Wait!
OZ and whole, white, treeless keys.
Great white and OZ and could just be OD
I stand firm with the OG, they know I'm a real nigga
Pocket full of racks and my bank account, Meek Mill nigga
Stuntin 'everything on my old hoes, styling everything on my enemies
Presidential is rose gold, let's say it's time to get some paper
Large crib without neighbors, hard ball but without Lakers
I passed 100 racks on my chain, they all know my name
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these niggas
I'll be flexing, flexing, flexing these bitches
It may not mean anything to you
I can see in his face that they want me to fall
Because all the bad little bitches I'll be fucking all of them
I want this shit forever
The haters tried to take my life and stop my heart, but I'm too smart
Never kill me
Haters trying to prosper
They just want to be me, but they can't see me with binoculars.
Niggas rappers built for TV need an Oscar
Strongest Name, Strongest Last Name
Flow so cold listen to it catch pneumonia
Yellow Diamond Studded Breitling
The blue and yellow face like Melo
And my multi-colored chain looks like frozen jelly
Hello, constant eating money for a meal
Drink rosé for a drink
Let me get some influence
When I was locked up it was a million dollars
Rolls Royce dreaming
Hungry like your Ramadan, I'm dining
And I don't mean the cup but God keeps me breathing
Nineteen years in the hole
See my dreams shatter and pray that all my goals
Don't fade as fourth quarter pass to 23
For all my real niggas
For all my niggas that aren't here
To all my niggas that are down right now
Now this is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, dodging cops all my real niggas
On the block, moving things around, changing lanes on them lame blacks
And this is for my young blacks
On the block, beating them up, the ducked cops are not dumb
Just bring everything and get these niggas
When I cry I cry real tears
For all my niggas locked up and I have years to live
I'm on my routine all the time this last year
Let's starve the dog flea
There is no limit to what I do, I am Master P on call
For that green like black taste of the Celtics, we play hard
I'm not trying to be the best, I'm trying to clear my mind
Tweety school private, a million dollar bank account
Sailing around the island, fooling the bitches
Remembering how we used to drive them crazy
Play the foulin 'game
The water is not deep until you swim with piranhas
The hood is not good, everyone thinks they are riding
Until you catch them slipping, put some shit on them
They prefer to see you shot before seeing you appear
The chain around your neck, all cool pulling on that drop
I got to the set no less where the niggas copy
So I had no choice but to grind and get this handsome
Since a child only my moms and my dad
I don't really fuck with rap, I do it because I have to
I do it for my fans and for my men for the dollars.
On the block, moving that rock, dodging cops all my real niggas
To get this change, another nigga in the chain
On the block, moving things around, changing lanes on them lame blacks
On the block, beating them up, the ducked cops are not dumb
Just bring everything and get these niggas
Never rats, never fold, niggas get close to you, blow your gun, nigga
I know that I bring you pain at the same time that I bring you joy
Through all the shit we've been through, you know I'm still your boy
You know I'm going to ride, we still have each other
Taking care of my little brother, my only mother
Look, we're not doing it wrong, we're actually doing it right
I'm going to do it with this rap, we're going to leave the neighborhood
Put his hands on you, I wish a nigga
Coming through a black mac tied black hood
I was locked up for a minute, I didn't go long
You wrote me consecutive letters and told me to stay strong
I had rainy days that you were with me during the storm
Nineteen years strong, I will not leave without food
You and my dad had ups and downs
Even though all of you broke up every day you used to come
So I love you mom, and I love you dad
Your little soldier will go far with this pen and this pad
If being broken is not a joke, no one smiles
I know I pushed my little penny every once in a while
But I'm stuck in the hood, fuck, I gotta grind
It will be real when I sign the line
But he doesn't see that razor and that works on that scale
The winter season is stirring with the woolrich and the Taurus
It's [?] But you know you have to take orders from them
You have to move them fourth this is how you get or
Now this is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, dodging cops all my real niggas
On the block, moving things around, changing lanes on them lame blacks
And this is for my young blacks
On the block, beating them up, the ducked cops are not dumb
Just bring everything and get these niggas
I remember days when I was dead broken
I got so fucking hungry my head hurt
I had to fix myself, make my head work
The man at the same time keeps my rap career first
This is how we live in the fight, all we have is pride
So when a nigger takes it from you shit, you gotta ride
Homicide homicide
So, by all necessary means, I will fight
To get my mom out of the neighborhood since my father died
If you don't do it you don't shine shit I have to try
A man made a brave man nigga it's me
You keep your faith in money, I keep mine in God
On the way to wealth
Me and my niggas counting dough
Fucking up these hoes getting digits come on
Now this is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, dodging cops all my real niggas
To get this change, another nigga in the chain
On the block, moving things around, changing lanes on them lame blacks
On the block, beating them up, the ducked cops are not dumb
Just bring everything and get these niggas
Never rats, never fold, niggas get close to you, blow your gun, nigga
You feel me, real niggas do real things
I hold my nigga together, fuck real niggas
We're still black
Get this black money
I let you fuck them guys
I'm Meek Holla to your fucking boy
Man this shit real man Head shots
Come on man
And I've seen these bitches do it all for the newspaper
For the love of money, they hoes fucking safe
And I know, and I know
Who said that money is not everything?
Who told you they were a fucking liar
Because all this money can buy you everything
I don't know anything that money can't buy.
I've never sinned, I've never crossed
Wherever I go, I'm burning burners
Defend this code, all feds deliver
Yes, I fuck with Papi, but no, I'm not Dominican
For the love of dividends, it's been around the corner
I let them know that I have it because he is out all day
In jewelry projects it means you did it
And the body can make you famous
And the key could stop you
It's not an apology, nigga, it's criminology, nigga
And I've seen these bitches do it all for the newspaper
And I just saw this paper turn my dog into an enemy
For the love of money, the love of the dough
And I know, and I know
Who said that money is not everything?
Who told you they were a fucking liar
Because all this money can buy you everything
I don't know anything that money can't buy.
And I'm never jealous, and I'm not thrilled
Speaking of details, tying up loose ends
Get to know me about the project, they used to say "Who are you?"
I copied all my mixtapes, you try to roll
You heard I was moving shit, wait a second, wait
They try to get in, the phones have ears
They also have eyes, you know
We break it down and give them blocks
Because if you play to get handsome
We will lay you down, we will mop
No, everywhere, every day, some route
Every smoke we light and it's on
Let's go
And I've seen these bitches do it all for the newspaper
And I just saw this paper turn my dog into an enemy
For the love of money, the love of the dough
For the love of money, they hoes fucking safe
Who told you they were a fucking liar
Because all this money can buy you everything
All a black wants is a mouth and lip service
Suck A Nigga Ho Cock, Suck A Nigga Ho Cock
Suck A Nigga Ho Cock, Suck A Nigga Ho Cock
I have a stack for the monster show, I have a stack for the monster show
Uhh, shorty in a molly, umm prolly
I'm leaving with my niggas and we can finally catch a body
I register on TV, we only see each other in the lobby
Vroom bitch, vroom-vroom bitch
That DOA, they sweep with the bitch broom
I'm talking about Murda in that pussy, I'm a dumb bitch
You spend the night, you come home in the afternoon, bitch
Move fast, there goes a shelf
But we like to fuck him
But you tell me he's an asshole
Tell me, listen, I'm done sucking on a black dick or something, bitch
Suck A Nigga Dick Ho
I have a stack for the monster show
I have a stack for the monster show
All a black wants is a mouth and lip service
All a black wants is a mouth and lip service
2 Chainz on this bitch, ho
Let me rephrase it
2 Chainz on your ho ho bustin 'on instrumentals
I bust that pussy like pimples
Bustin likes guns, fuck
I'm Justin, it's that simple (tell them)
I'm going crazy while I'm riding
Driver driving
If you turn around man, they'll fire you
I love the new pussy, I should have kept the tag
I was born to win and I'm made to last
Uh, on the bench like I'm gonna laugh
And when I left, all you see is a dealer tag
Leggo
Suck A Nigga Dick Ho Bitch
Suck A Nigga Dick Ho
I have a stack for the monster show
I have a stack for the monster show
All a black wants is a mouth and lip service
All a black wants is a mouth and lip service
Yes, I take ATL DOA, MIA, it's KOD
I will go directly OD
OD straight, OG straight, you know I ball ho
I got these bitches looking for me, you should call me Waldo
I tell him to open it, break it like a pig
Throw money into the air, albeit something far away
I left? I left?
My new chicken got my speed
I get money from ball players like I'm in the league
In the league, all I want is lip service
I could kill that pussy, all the bitches killed
Swerving I bet they say
Finish off without toupee
These enemies say I'm overcooked
Suck A Nigga Dick Ho Bitch
I have a stack for the monster show
All a black wants is a mouth and lip service
Who wants to stop us now?
This year we will go all the way
Meek Milly, huh
I know I shouldn't have done that
I know it's back
I know it will destroy everything I did
Probably gonna send your boy away
But this game I play is not a way to fix it, it is inevitable
Live by helicopter laws die on the streets
Fuck a job earning dollars a week
And the [?] Take the long fall
That's why I work trying to shine like a lone star
My mother right in the mix, gun in my palm tight
You care about a spotlight I'd rather get my routine right
Rhyme well, niggas tryin 'to do a trick like it's graduation night
But I'm at my best as Lebron in the highlights
That's why these niggas can't stop me, copy or clone me
That's why these hoes on me are the hungry boy
You heard that I keep it real, other fake boys
But I'm gonna give these niggas hell until the lord calls me
I know I shouldn't have done that
I know it's back
I know it will destroy everything I did
Probably gonna send your boy away
The flow is sick but I find ways to improve it
That block is hot but I find ways to make that cheddar
I could drop my album I could fail
But I'm so pretty, so my watch will shine forever
I have chicken blocks, I love my position
I'm in my own division, I make my own decisions
You try to stop what I'm building and then I go to prison
I swear on everything, dawg, I'll let it ring
Move your fucking bells like LL [?] Fucking rip my change
Now listen, I play carefully in these streets
You want to hear the real thing and then bring your ear closer to this beat
I flow hard, I go hard because I got to homie
I have it soft, it is difficult, who is trying to do it?
This game I play is more real than a [?]
I know I shouldn't have done that
I know it's back
I know it will destroy everything I did
Probably gonna send your boy away
But this game I play is not a way to fix it, it is inevitable
Wrong time, wrong place, caught in the wrong case
They had me sitting in the F getting the O face
Thinking a lot
We are not shooting just to get a name because we murder
There are no witnesses who do not see what happens, but they heard them
We serve them, are they appropriate boys with them?
Tell the law to call coroners, forget the doctors
Cause that dead nigga hit his body hit his dead
Ya shit, I can make you disappear soldiers
And get you niggas out of her pussy like fast food
Bad movements, I'll make him drop the shells like cashews
Cash rules everything near me
Many niggas are scary
But I'll be in the super dirty neighborhood like I'm Harry
Catch me, I'm cooler than I've ever been
Hater, no, I've never been
You caught me in the squad I'm carrying with you with that metal and
I'm on the south side but the death of the north forever
Where they get that job from and run that cheddar on
You better than who not me
Mel Love and Young P
I really know Nigga 'Lil is a fucking young G
And I'm a boss, can you tell Ricky Ross to come see
In Philadelphia, where the murder rate is higher than that of a tree.
How sour that D purp, piff ooh wee
Having a lean nigga like Promethazine
I'm a professional with the wings like paying less paying than
Throw it on the hood, the demons say it's good
And the drug addicts go crazy and go straight back
Like braids you niggas on hoes
Fuck a brick, I'm trying to make it through the ship's load
Getting money, I really wouldn't say that
Drop the pot and weigh that
Chop rock and slang that
In the middle of the hood, drug traffickers lurk where you stay
My man said never mess up where you lie
The demons the demons got the job, so fuck it, I'm going to take that
I'm not going to let it happen to me, I'm going to chase that
You have to earn money to do that, real
Why do you care about my next bitch?
I try to see what my bitch face looks like
I told that old bitch that I was a groupie doe
We are about to make a movie
I take my new bitch to the mall
Me and my new bitch, yeah we dance
Said we're all in Neimans and shit
I'm in the cleanest of shit
Hol 'on, really freestyle ion
But black in the meantime
I have a bitch in my coupe, Lil Snupe and I
'About to take her to TV, she's going to get it crackin'
That nigger standing there like what happened?
Hey
But we are not talking about Cassidy
That means he is halfway
Half way and half way
We get the job halfway
What you know about 36 riding a dirty brick
You got a bitch with you, you keep acting sober
But you're stoned because you just smoked an L
And if this nigga plays bad, we won't go to jail
Motherfucker, niggas rats, show and tell
Because if the police catch you, you will show yourself and count
Show them where the stash is, where the cash is
I have a bitch that shows me where that butt is
And the last time I saw the job, nigga grabbed that
Then I bagged that nigga, I had that
What do you know about a nigga to scale?
Glock '30, giving everyone a black hell
I did that hit, all in jail black
Hit you and you move like a black snail
Slow motion, drinking purp potion
I'm making money for everyone, they know it
A millionaire say I'm chosen
Make them red on them, they move, you know I see them
Hit 'em in the dark nigga fucking the larks
Playing around you park, 106 when I spark
In this drum clip, young nigga but I run shit
And you're stupid like a dumb bitch
I make a silly bitch give me head, I let you know where I'm from bitch
The 8, published by the door
Fuck with none of the rappers, I can't relate
All that shit you talk about that nigga, isn't it
I used to play that damn corner, paranoid getting high on marijuana
Tryna swing that work nigga, this is our life
Tied up, .44 nigga (pop pop)
Break life but we're on tour nigga, mac life we let that thing rumble nigga
I saw niggas go to the early graves
For trying to play with hammers in their early days
I fall, I have nah, I have pearly waves
My shit is flowing, and I'm going to move on
And I'm going to get this money, everyone you meet
That I came from below and reached the top
And I started with a '22, I got to a Glock
Then I walked over to the mac, then I went and picked up a bat
'Member started with' lac, back then do you remember that?
We were chasing the rock
Did you take yours? down on the snub block
They reserved it with an ounce of crack, the shit was rock
They tried to take that nigga, we raised shit to stop, we put it in the car
They couldn't even find the O nigga, it was hard
He put that thing behind the badge, shit, it was smooth
He couldn't find it, he had to rewind us
We all reserve with the small pair of Irons
Let me bring it back and remember it
The same block that stopped me when they found us
Put me in the cell, we were coming on a scooby
We had a little sprinter, we didn't come on a hoopty
He came down I said to my niggas, "mm mm mm"
I put a hole in your head, I'm not talking about a dumb nigga
I'm Rich Blade, talking about no nigga Coogi
I'll slip you one, I'm not talking Roofy's nigga
You're playing round nigga, let's shoot you
Walk on you, if you're running, let's run
My young niggas get money, we don't fuck
All of you niggas on your team, fucking clowns
Everything is real niggas, we don't steal, we kill niggas
We treat them like, niggas will pump fake niggas and fire drills
Young Blacks Getting Money
And we don't owe you niggas shit
I'm from nigga Philly
We come from the bottom
And the blacks have the nerve to ask me why I'm doing stunts?
Hey?
I'm going to take Ciroc with Diddy, drunk Spade with Hov
In the 40's VIP, with some wicked hoes
The same night the work cooked half that was sold
A pyrex and a triple beam
Since Mr. King had a dream, we didn't miss a demon
If you were there, you know we danced, Mr. Clean
Just doing the right thing because in my life I've been from hell and back
I'm that nice and I don't write so you can tell them that
I'm just making up nights when I was selling crack
In the corner in the cold trying to throw their O's at them
And half of my niggas in town were against the code
They said niggas, still partying bold niggas
But I'm like hell, I'm young and I'm making it old nigga
Take a walk to that mirror, look at yourself
You see a getta or a nigga just looking for help
And every night I'm in the studio killing myself
Fuck with them
They scream, be humble, boy, be humble
But no one says that when my stomach used to rumble
I looked in a cell when I saw my dreams fall apart
Now I'm here buzzing, you can here the bumblebee
I just went to every thing I dove in
No one will go back to the bottom
No one is going to hit rock bottom
I can't be every role model black
I can't go back to the bottom
When I'm only for a couple million for a rainy day
Out of season but I practice like I have a game today
Feeling like Mike before it fades away
Am I how should I take the shot? or let it fade away?
And all this love that I'm receiving won't take away my hatred
But these enemies motivate me in a crazy way
There's no me on the team, from what I've seen
He is all man to himself, until I intervene
When the dream breaks, they sell love like cocaine
Or heroin of heroin I am Cobain
I'm exploding, I did my thing
Nigga
They told me that these roads were pure as gold
I never said I never sold my soul
I just went to everything I dove in
No one will go back to the bottom
No one is going to hit rock bottom
I can't go back to the bottom
The devil around the corner and the reaper one block away
It's body after body, very few of us find a way
You have to keep an eye on the hook like you're hitting Dr. J
I get soft every time we go against you
You come across like AI did Mike for this ball
For this rock, they shoot you, they cut you
Because in this game we shoot metal like a pinball
I put this Mac on your face like lip gloss
And you're right and you get on ice like Lindros
Nigga
No one will go back to the bottom
No one is going to hit rock bottom
I can't be every role model black
I can't go back to the bottom
I started with a dollar and a dream
And I am willing to go by any means
I can't be every role model black
Why is no one my role model?
I have my own child to raise
And my life is very precious
And my son expects me to walk through that door every night
So any nigga tryna stop my shine, gotta get it
None of my niggas
I hear everyone talking
Spend too much money, be humble
Man fuck all of that
It's D.C. double M, G
We got pulled out of the barrel in your crab niggas
Can you hear me?
Meek Milly, real nigga for life!
Diamonds in my fist and in my arms
Freeze on my pinky ring, watch me flex on all of you
Now I get it, these niggas mad because she chose the boy, hey
I'm in New York, Derrick Rose this shit, hey
I go around the city in a Rolls and shit
I have that bag and we are moving that snow
Like it's Christmas and Santa, I got hoes and shit
Hundred K greats in my Audemar
When we run, we hit one of you
I'm going to post in the corner store
I'm so hot I could break the thermometer
The police look at us and follow us
Leaf through that paper without a calendar
All these jewels as I celebrate Hanukkah
I have a different kind of money
I'm in a different kind of routine
We are in a different kind of time
Go get the money, bitches
Bitches are getting off the line
I turned it into a two
I turned that point into a nine
Hey hey hey hey yeah
Look at my neck, damn yeah
Look at my doll yeah
You know how that froze, yeah
Look at my fist yeah
You know how that froze, yeah
Skrrrt, driving in a Bentley, yeah
Following Meek and lil 'Nicki, already
It's just me and Liltney, already
Diamonds so wet you could slip, ay
Look at the bitch, take a picture
You know she's going to do a wheelie, yeah
Count my money to a milli, yeah
Drive a Porsche in Philadelphia
Holding that gun without a holster
Diamonds and Rollie get great
I'm a rock star crush my guitar
Diamonds in my fist and in my arms
Meek and I don't dress the same, we hang out at Goyard
Freeze on my pinky ring, watch me flex on all of you
I get it now, you guys are mad at these 80M
Twenty twelve was playing like Tom Brady then
Movie, I'm living through these Scorsese glasses
Look at me, and deep throat a three eighty gun
We landed new ports on them, no baby, no cigarettes
Clear ports, air force, sweat with a big diamond
Make the niggas look at my hand even though I'm not imitating
Different types of money, in a different type of bankruptcy
Any of you bitches says Nicki, you in a different kind of coke
I'm just sitting in the mansion taking a dip in the pool
We don't go out without killers
We are in a different kind of rules, uhh
I'm a rock star, I scratch my guitar
Diamonds in my ring and in my arms.
Freezing in my pussy ring, watch me flex on all of you
You know how that froze, yeah
You know how that froze, yeah
You know how that froze, yeah
You know how that froze, yeah
Eh what? (Yes)
You know how that froze, yeah
Look at my neck, damn yeah
You know how that froze, yeah
Look at my doll yeah
You know how that froze, yeah
Look at my fist yeah
You know how that froze, yeah
Fuck bitches, get money, get money and fuck bitches
You know I'm a G, I'm a G
Get money, get money and fuck bitches
You know what MOB is
But the cops want to arrest him like a cardiac
So I'm going to dodge them like a Charger, Magnum or Viper
Your bitch needs service, I'm the plumber who's going to channel her
I spit at them like I'm in the cypher
That's why I knock them down like the bowling alley, strikers
The way I kill shit, shit, I should be a lifesaver
They say my bars are on point like a sniper
Just call me Malvo, I'm tied like Velcro
My gat has holes in the headrest
Oh, is that your girl? Hit it here, I could care less
Fuck bitches, get money, get money and fuck bitches
You know I'm a G, I'm a G
You know what MOB is
I had no pot to piss, so I just broke pigeons
I put my youth on missions, gave them jobs and made them change
We made them smell, cut a bag and deliver
If you want it, you get it, not only do I speak it, I live it
You do rap to live, I do rap for a hobby
Put my name on your rap and see how I catch a new body
If the labels don't sign me, I'm not crying, on Ryan
I just hit my connection and I get more bricks in shipping
You see them FA soldiers, move because they shoot
I have friends like Diddy and my black Meek Milly
If they come with me, trust me, it won't be pretty
I know I represent my city, that's the city of Philadelphia
I have my seat reclined, I'm getting cold
Use both hands when I'm still clapping
I have a packet full of crack and a packet full of pills
Because we rush to the muscle
Yes [?] She came back and he came back for the emotion
I'm in my brown paper bag and I think I'm taking over
See my fridge and freezer empty, but this ice and baking soda
So we take it to the plot, cut it and make it boulders
Scream at the demons that paid us
CH, we slide through shit that's blue Windex
And the windows were tinted too, so the haters can't see through
I'm on the projects too, posted right in the circle
If you plan to come then those guys will probably hurt you
Time is my money dog, so every minute man
That money, money calling, ruining my minute plan
I'm on my shit again, you know what time it is
Fuck bitches, get money, get money and fuck bitches
You know I'm a G, I'm a G
You know what MOB is
Most of us successful people could tell you a story
About when they weren't fucking with us
Now that we're on top, they're not fucking with us
Now they try to travel because my money is long
These niggas ain't shit, half a million dollar whip, nigga
Tell your bitch to suck a rich black cock
But I'm not stumbling cause you niggas ain't fucking with me
Tell them "Nah, nah, you niggas aren't fucking with me"
Yes when the money came all the hoes also came
And I'm still who? Me! Still be with the same crew
None of my niggas don't fall for the bitches
They're falling for money, it's not you, it's not you niggas
Now hunters in the building, it's not hard nigga
I'm like oh lord, what a feeling when you stop
Drop the ceiling on them, fools they were watching as we starved nigga
They got fat and I lost weight
So I screwed up with them niggas when I walked in
My friend caught me for a role, that was not my friend
That wasn't my love, so fuck that nigga, knock him out
More money than you can imagine
Now we are buying more PJ than we can drink
More than we could swallow
Get money that's my motto
When you're in the lead there's nothing to follow
I know...
These niggas ain't shit, half a million dollar whip, nigga
They can hate like I'm not upset about this shit
But I'm not stumbling cause you niggas ain't fucking with me
Tell them "Nah, nah, you niggas aren't fucking with me"
When the money came, all the problems also came
And when the problems came, all they had to blame was you
When blacks hate, they get caught by fumes
And angry at the favors you're not doing
They are going to change sides
I could tell you fools that they want me to go
Before I let my mom cry, you know I'm gonna let that shit fly
Sell crack until dawn
Moving fish, and I'm not talking about any fried fish
And the reason they can't keep up, because when they sleep you know we're awake
We move kilos, then we go back up
I take a turn, then accelerate
With your plan A, it couldn't be us
Or see you when it's game time
I'm up with my feet up
And I'm eating, every beating
That feed us like a fetus
It had more stripes than Adidas
And my father told me not to relax, kill these niggas
And when I kill them all, me and my Philadelphia niggas
These niggas ain't shit, half a million dollar whip, nigga
Tell your bitch to suck a rich black cock
They can hate like I'm not upset about this shit
But I'm not stumbling cause you niggas ain't fucking with me
Tell them "Nah, nah, you niggas aren't fucking with me"
I'm in a decade of mastering the game
With the legends, the best MCs and the new niggas
It's me
They're not fucking with me
DC 3
BH, flamers
You, bitch, ass nigga
You know how we do it
Blood gang piglet
When my hammer hits your head and that chain explodes
I had them take you to bed when that choppy thing
Brains chopped into flames dropped on the same block
Where they saw your main dishes
Different day, the same Glock
Sunny weather, heavy rain showers
We live day by day, we run with metal slings
Fire-ready arm makes your entire body freeze
How many niggas go down to ride I wanna know
On that man's mission until I turn him to dust
What, haze flow burning in the dust
I'm hotter than I ever burned what I want
Any clue, each
Now let's get back to that real shit how niggas are made
Dirty in the field, that's why there are still thirty
Super dirty cops are coming, gas shit off the floor
Double tube, [?] Flashes like a [?]
We live off the murder of money, stealing extortion
I can't feel my face, what he says brings me back the music
Small fish, yes
If you can't swim, you're going to drown, hoe
Hahaha
Bad Lil Thottie, she has bodies
I'm on perkies, she's on Molly
Drinking dirty, smoking in Cali
Big Rolls Royce, not Maseratis
I'm about to get that V12 out
I'm shit with these niggas like Ezal
Let her ride that dick without a seat belt
With the money, I know that she has no good intentions
Niggas running their mouths like females
When you win, they just want to see you fail
When you win, they just want to see you lose
Niggas is stealing, I can't let them see my movements
He started selling that crack rock (crack rock)
Now we sell sands (lit!)
White boys say I'm a genius, white girls say I'm twisted
We did 30 bandz in Neimans, now we have 20 thousand in Barney's
I ever put a pop bitch on the block list, I don't exploit shit
Because I got shit, in fall six
With a big bitch, the whole squad went on
I heard your new shit, that's not it
He's not talking about money, so it's silly
Bran has the gas, you're not on, no way
Fuck that checkup (Fuck that checkup)
Fuck that checkup (Fuck that checkup)
We get rich and these niggas get sick
I'm so enlightened
I fucked that bitch as soon as I met her (as soon as I met her)
Young black man, fuck that checkup (young black man, young black man)
Fuck that checkup (fuck it)
Turn on my wrist and my neck (woah, woah)
Fuck that checkup (fuck it)
Young nigga, fuck that checkup (fuck that checkup)
Fuck that checkup (Fuck that checkup)
Fuck that checkup (fuck it, fuck it)
Fuck that checkup (Fuck that checkup)
Back on this bitch and we go back inside
I'm about to land in the city again
She with the gang, him stumbling again
She gets arrogant like, "Yes, I'm with him"
Five bands, Gucci coat, rock once
I will never use it again, no
(Hey yeah!) Gucci booty so laid back
Damn, I thought not, fuck you and then hit your cousin
She's not my type, give her back, huh
My car has no space
Yes i put them all up front
Yeah my engine in the back
Little nigga, we don't talk about anything
If that shit isn't about the racks
But that girl was diverting me, emergency diamonds
I wake up all night, don't rest too much
I spent two hunnid putting the rest
Young Nigga Fucks That Checkup
Young Nigga Fucks That Checkup
Fuck that checkup (Fuck that checkup)
Fuck that checkup (Fuck that checkup)
We get rich, and these niggas are sick
They need a checkup (they need a checkup)
I'm so enlightened

Fuck that checkup (fuck it)
Young black man, fuck that checkup (young black man, young black man)
Turn on my wrist and my neck (woah, woah)
Fuck that checkup (fuck it)
Young nigga, fuck that checkup (fuck that checkup)
Fuck that checkup (Fuck that checkup)
Fuck that checkup (fuck it, fuck it)
Uh, my old bitch, your new bitch
She wants to vibrate like Q-Tip, she's labeled like you
Nigga said he wanted to fade me, we ran into him
He doesn't want to do shit
I don't care what he says, we are not playing
We just came to shoot shit
Yes, go upstairs (run, run, run)
Niggas be tweetin '(niggas be tweetin')
They are hitting each other
Bitches must be caught, tell them to hit me on Snap
She hit me back, oh Lord, she applauded
You ever fucked a bad bitch on the air mattress
Young and dirty bull who lives luxuriously
Get up, go to Paris
You can say we've never had shit, no way
Fuck that checkup (Fuck that checkup)
Fuck that checkup (Fuck that checkup)
We get rich, and these niggas are sick
They need a checkup (they need a checkup)
I'm so enlightened
Young black man, fuck that checkup (young black man, young black man)

Wait wait a minute
Everyone thought it was over
Fuck you mean boy?
I spent a thousand on these shitty jeans
You got my old bitch, I brought my new bitch out of your dreams, boy
What the fuck are you talking about boy? Fuck you mean boy?
I spent a thousand on these shitty jeans
So much money made him break the seams, boy
You got my old bitch, I brought my new bitch out of your dreams, boy

What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
The same hoes that said you couldn't do it trying to kick it
Balmain denim spent a thousand on the ticket
Catching the money banging banging like who it is
I lie down all bent, there's no rap star either
I have your income on my belt, talking about your house on my wrist
The note of your car in my jeans, my bloody sneaks like shit
That's murder sing bloody murder bloody murder
I ask your bitch to make all this money nervous
She does it well and I will pay her for her service
When bosses talk shut your mouth if you're a worker
Get pussy in my Maybach I think the driver heard us
I know she's depressed about whatever she's going to do for a dollar
And now that Boosie at home knows we're going to dance for a month
Why don't we fuck with you niggas, 'cause they're all rats?
Fuck you mean boy?
You got my old bitch, I brought my new bitch out of your dreams, boy
I spent a thousand on these shitty jeans
So much money made him break the seams, boy

What the fuck are you talking about boy?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
I keep a hundred thousand in these Robin jeans
What the fuck are you talking about?
Bitches left me in prison, threw away their dreams
I'm the leader of the Mad Max assassination team
Conscious ice man and my money grows on trees
Sicker than ever richer than ever to call a truck Brinks
I hit it, holding my line, you better pick it up
Buzz money strong nigga real street real like shit
What the fuck are you talking about, what the fuck are you talking about
Fuck you, fuck your mom and fuck your team
He seems to burst my jeans, I need HOV money
There's no 360 deal this real shit, get all the money from my show
Wait let me let my money do the talking
I have more thousand dollar jeans than there are stores in the south
In my heart I'm a boss and this is this, this is what the fuck I mean
Boosie Badazz ball older bank rolls
What the hell do you mean I'm that black game
I spent a thousand on these shitty jeans
So much money made him break the seams, boy
What the fuck are you talking about boy? Fuck you mean boy?
I spent a thousand on these shitty jeans
So much money made him break the seams, boy

What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck are you talking about?
One thing is certain, two things are certain
I was booked with three bricks, you came home, niggas working
Clown niggas, they should've put you in the circus
Iglesias, hey, is it really worth it?
If you heard him say, why do you rush and talk?
Before I drop a penny tell people a lie
I swear to God, man, I was nineteen, I caught my first case
Nine defendants and snitchin 'wasn't the worst case
I had a hard time giving my name and my date of birth
But today blacks go to jail and it's an earthquake
Ratifying their connection, telling them where they got the connection
Back to the house, niggas fucking with him, good luck
Twelve pictures of Henny's face lifted me to my feet
Any situation ask for me and I stood up
Catch you sliding like a transmission, fuck your hood
From my hood to who's your hood, well, what's up?
Ugh, nothing even if my level is high
This MAC will leave a nigga like SpongeBob
I said all I know is Flex, shitting on my ex
Bad hoes on my team, dick 'em down like next
I rock YSL so cool, fly like hell, no jet
She says I'm arrogant, I say it's not me
Doll clothes in hockey, Porsche Box as Ali
My hide and seek is Bally, in my hood probably
Just rolling in that ghost, taking care of them folks
Heater on my hip, trunk full of that work
I say my shooters like Dirk, 10 racks and you merged
I put it on your head, nigga
First week and you're dead, nigga
Catch me on your bikes, let the throttle explode
Niggas knows I'm nice and I have a lot
Like your corner, nigga, I'll buy the block
Yes, I was starving, this is revenge
Got my Hova hustle and my Baby stunt
So I'm fucking around and my new watch cost me eighty
Got a pair of Rovers, got a Mercedes
I have 100 racks on me now
I don't have a computer but now I have a MAC
And I'm a shooter and I really applaud homie now
And fuck the jail cause my nigga Ross is holding me
I'm skipping bail and we in this bitch, we just left the dealership
I just got into the game, but I'm killing shit
My nigga wale
We in the building, we in the building
I had a dream like Martin Luther
I was in the ghost getting brain like a Harvard student
Check my fame record, it's not really difficult to prove it
I went to jail, I went back to that kitchen like Martha Stewart
With a Pyrex trying to do a stretch of nine
I was just in the yard with lifeguards, working on my biceps
When I missed sleeping and working weeks to prepare my mother
'Cause I remember some nights I used to hold that gun tight
In the middle of the jungle trying to reach the sunlight
Still, with that pen and pad, just give me a microphone
And I'm going to get richer, they're going to get sicker
Why are you mad at me? Because they are not in the photo
Because they were in some shit when they started blinking
And the camera started flickering, niggas lost
Black chevelle on the blades, boy
Dark shades, leather jacket like Blade, boy
Come to my city like, "What's the focus, boy?"
I come with open doors
Middle finger every cop
Chevy engine block, everything is heavy stop
Sweatpants, the car dance, I make that bitch do the wop
Man I'm losing my religion
I have these angels on my shoulders and they tell me to listen
I exploded this Alpine and got lost in my system
They tell me it's the devil's music and the demons have imprisoned
This strap has no velcro
So I'm depressed for whatever, whenever, wherever
Every night I'm on the road, trying to understand what it's like
I still find time alone to kick it with my son
I know niggas see them on blogs and it looks like fun
Yes, you have to choose each crumb
I never thought I'd see the day I leave the slums
I did it for my team, put them in some
And every day we shit, niggas with some runs
It was out of control, the block was hot as a stove
I was with them OR, at the same time that they were patrolling the block
Wait wait a minute
Everyone thought it was over
Fuck you mean boy
So much money made him break the seams, boy
You got my old bitch, I brought my new bitch out of your dreams, boy
What the fuck are you talking about boy?
Fuck you mean boy

What the fuck are you talking about, what the fuck are you talking about
What the fuck are you talking about, what the fuck are you talking about
What the fuck are you talking about, what the fuck are you talking about
The same hoes that said you couldn't do it trying to kick it
Balmain denim spent a thousand on the ticket
Catching the money banging banging like who it is
Think Benji at the door, take the helicopter, go get it.
I lie down all bent, there's no rap star either
Let it scream, we cook that hard crack, cement
I have your income on my belt, talking about your house on my wrist
That's murder sing bloody murder bloody murder
I ask your bitch to make all this money nervous
When bosses talk shut your mouth if you're a worker
Cause I've been working chasing money like I'm hurting
Roll the partition up
All in the act of cutting like this broad give him a fuck
I know she's depressed about whatever she's going to do for a dollar
And now that Boosie at home knows we're going to dance for a month
And suck it all in the back, and all of us tied
Why don't we fuck with you niggas, 'cause they're all rats?
Fuck you mean boy
I spent a thousand bucks on these fucking jeans
So much money made him break the seams, boy
You got my old bitch, I brought my new bitch out of your dreams, boy

What the fuck are you talking about, what the fuck are you talking about
I keep a hundred thousand in these Robin jeans
What the fuck are you talking about?
Bitches left me in prison, threw away their dreams
Conscious ice man and my money is growing trees
Sicker than ever richer than ever to call a truck Brinks
What the fuck are you talking about girl, it's two words, bitch shit
Buzz money strong nigga real street real like shit
What the fuck are you talking about, what the fuck are you talking about
Fuck you, fuck your mom and fuck your team
He seems to burst my jeans, I need HOV money
Wait let me let my money do the talking
My rollie cost your house, my shows sold out
I have more thousand dollar jeans than there are stores in the south
In my heart I'm a boss and this is this, this is what the fuck I mean
Boosie Badazz ball older bank rolls
You can keep my old bitch cause I don't make the same hoes
The jeans in my closet add up to a Range Rover
What the hell do you mean I'm that black game
I spent a thousand bucks on these fucking jeans
So much money made him break the seams, boy
What the fuck are you talking about boy?
I spent a thousand bucks on these fucking jeans
So much money made him break the seams, boy
You got my old bitch, I brought my new bitch out of your dreams, boy

What the fuck are you talking about, what the fuck are you talking about
What the fuck are you talking about, what the fuck are you talking about
What the fuck are you talking about, what the fuck are you talking about
Ugh, Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasing ends
And I'm in earning money, I'm not in making friends
Let's say loyalty makes a man, he has a friend and he said
I knew him as a boy, man this wild game
But niggas vowed to a code I never break
Ridin 'at heavyweight
Thirty-six O's in the bird, call it featherweight
Never on time, when I show up I'll be ready late
And I'm trying to fill myself up, masks in full clips
We sell soft, we sell hard like a brick shop
On my black dick, that's what I thought your girl was
You pissed off, I only deal with big dogs
Could have bought a Maybach before signing with Rick Ross
That's the reason why I'm showing up
Donating while these enemies hate these niggas
Niggas wants to kill us, this label wants me purpula
Because I can't understand that, elastic band of money that
Take off in my city and in your city where I land
When I'm in your city forty rounds on my damn leash
Drinking ciroc oner then a light switch
In my 96 Impala Growlin through the night shift
Catch you while the cameras are off, show up in your damn house
How excuse me MA'AM where such-and-such a hard ride doesn't buckle up
All left hooks right uppercuts treat you like the beat and then fuck you up
In the kitchen with a 6 duce tryna turn there to a maybach
I spank, spank really hard like Dale Gana on the race track
I'm ahead but I'm way behind, way behind but I'm ahead
Away shy niggas like ten to one, ???? but there are ten of them
Bitch screwed up like ten of them, oops I mean like ten of us
I don't want to mount it, isn't it tinted? coming through what fender
The Illuminati want my mind, soul and body
They ask me if I would change everything for a maseratti
I said no, he said 100 million. Prolli said.
In addition to a ghost, panama and the bugatti
We can come to an agreement, I put my mother on the hill
I go to hell and burn it
I set myself on fire and then I burn them, niggas act like they're learning
I LEFT
Let the niggas have the Grammys, we got the streets
We are already rich and my girl the baddest
This Rollie as my trophy, young nigga
When they needed motivation (What do you do?)
I gave them hope
When my nigger needed money (What are you doing?)
I gave him drugs
Every time we went to war (What do we do?)
We gave them smoke
Demons I was facing, I was broke
Fuck that shit, we gave them soap
They forgot that we gave them hope
I'd spend time in that corner trying to stack myself a hundred
Tied up with that Glock with my hip shit, the cops were running
They had it segregated, bulletproof Caddy, I scaled
I went up to my game like an escalator
I saw them ride with the fake and I hesitated
The judge had to sentence a black, without a point
I'm getting scared on these niggas, I'm not sparing these niggas
I cut your head off with a trigger hair
I try to reach my chain shit, I deal with you niggas
Uh, back at Phil, we're going to get to the money and stack that dough until it comes
'Member of them bitches? They played us on the day like a Sega
Now I have paper, the young black man is very important
Niggas hate, look how they face
I gave them hope
When my nigger needed money (What are you doing?)
I gave him drugs
Every time we went to war (What do we do?)
Demons I was facing, I was broke
Look at the money and stack it
Shit you're busting isn't adding
Shit you're busting there's no point
And they're fifty reasons why I should kill, nigga
But really, nigga, I've been taking trips with my Philadelphia niggas
He has the richest girl, she is from your neighborhood
Niggas hates me, I'm really not tripping, shit, I'm fine
I'm deep in your hood where you'll never be
Be with them boys you could never steal
You could never adapt
You know the game, if you represent a rat, you will always be a rat
We were never with it
You tried to go to "Money" May with that paper, but now you're in debt because you were never that.
Damn, are you drugged? You know better than that
Mention my name and Berettas with it
I really move in these streets, in the world with that piece, I'm like Metta with that
Fuck what you heard, I'm gonna get mine off the sidewalk
I just sit and look and watch
Like niggas, they didn't ride the wave and they surfed
Mention my name, the shit they kill you for
Shit they rob you for, shit they kill you for
Shit, they take boxes to church, oh
I gave them hope
When my nigger needed money (What are you doing?)
I gave him drugs
Every time we went to war (What do we do?)
We gave them smoke
Demons I was facing, I was broke
Fuck that shit, we gave them soap
They forgot that we gave them hope
Fuck, clap, fuck, get
Fuck, clap, nigga, tie
Damn, clap
Damn, clap
Damn, clap
Oh lord i feel
I'm in the big boy Phantom with the suicide gates I'm killing myself
I'm not feeling these niggas, I'm roasting these niggas, I'll kill them myself
Fuck, clap, fuck, clap
Fuck, clap, nigga, tie
Fuck, clap, fuck, clap
Ya nigga tied us up
Fuck, clap, fuck, clap
Ya nigga tied us up
Damn, clap, because we are not playing like this
He pop blows grass pop that pussy
That's your girl i got that pussy
I treat that shit like a pussy project
How to hold on, rolling abroad, we show up
Drinking read my team we spill
Stop the scene it's me she knows us
Pockets full of green like a four leaf clover.
Wait wait, we go into this bitch, we screw ourselves and we go
Wait wait, I walk to his bitch talk, he starts talking that shit and then he's gone
Back to the condo, where other top niggas bitches turn side hoes
And little she brought her friends with her, tell them to swallow
And we are not talking about Twitter nigga who will follow, hello
Staying in my routine and stacking it directly
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
There is no time to sleep, I have to stay awake
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
Yes, the early bird gets the worm first
Sixteen, we were out there on that sidewalk first
With a room trying to see who gets a bird first
How to fuck an undercover cop who is treated first
We don't give a damn whoever faced us got burned first (yeah)
We like that we went to look for this role
My shooters were trying to kill, it's like we were going to look for them later
Trying to turn a dollar bill into a nice situation
Just thinking about them, benjis have a black in the womb
Waiting, losing patience, my mind racing
Also, my seed grows, so you know I need dough and ...
When I wake up, the first thing I have in mind is to lift this cake
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
When I wake up, the first thing I have in mind is to lift this cake
There is no time to sleep, I have to stay awake
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
I, I used to smoke my lil L
Because being broke made a black feel like a half man
Although we have gone to get this money
We are only in a traffic jam
And I want to live life fast
Fast cars, fast bitches, fast money, fast bike
I was in the dark, shit, that money was like a flashlight
This money is not a joke
Homies that look like snakes
They were great when I was broke
But now I'm making money
They look at me funny
That's why I keep my heater on
Because i have never slept
When I wake up, the first thing I have in mind is to lift this cake
Staying in my routine and stacking it directly
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
When I wake up, the first thing I have in mind is to lift this cake
There is no time to sleep, I have to stay awake
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
See I'm getting rich or I die trying
If getting money was sinning, damn, I'm frying
If I'm lying I'm flying I'm breaking my iron
If a nigga tries to take it, I'll get something out of his face
I go in and out of state, up and down 95
Just to get it for my niggas, risk my life
They want what I have, they will never get it from me (never)
But we went to get this money
Staying in my routine and stacking it directly
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
When I wake up, the first thing I have in mind is to lift this cake
There is no time to sleep, I have to stay awake
Let's 'let's' let's get this money
My Delaware niggas (let's 'let's' let's get this money)
All my niggas from Jersey (let's 'let's' let's get this money)
My niggas from Baltimore (let's 'let's' let's get this money)
Chi city niggas (let's 'let's' let's get this money)
Let's get this money
I'm so fucking hungry, my head hurts. I had to fix myself and make my head work, but at the same time I had to maintain my rap career first. Everyone knows that The Hood can be your worst distraction and when a black man disrespects The gun is your first reaction. This is how we live in the fight, all we have is pride. So when a nigger takes it from you, you have to bear murder murder. So, by all necessary means, I strive to get my mom out of the chapel since my dad died. If you don't grind and then you don't shine shit I gotta try, done man Brave man Nigga It's me. I'm from the chapel where the tears never end and the pain never stops, the game on the clock. Yes, it seems sunny, but the rain is going to fall and the bodies are going to fall, that's why I'm going hard. Wandering these bad streets, I'm on guard Cus Niggas, stealing lives faster and then stealing cars. I am still alive praying that I will not fall, this sin made me win even though I am completely wrong. Then I stop looking around. We are all gone. The last of the last strong holds. Some say I have not earned it, you break it, I burn it, I am going to rebuild it because I am thorough and determined. Call me meek mill because I am the most real. in the world. From north to south, I am murder while you were relaxed. I was in my crib writing raps thinking of millions, cars, jewelry, and buildings. Blacks don't respect him until they see you progress, but trust me. mma kill em. This is a 645 without the topless coupe, great fun on the engine. This is big business 44s 40s and 9s that are big cookies. 40 guys target your squad now that's revenge. They prefer to see you shot before they see you lift a chain around your neck all cool pulling that drop. I got around set 9 except where the niggas get up, so I had no choice but to grind and get this trap. Ever since I was a child, my mothers were my dad, the streets were my old head and I was raised as a rider
Look, I'm a type A1 guy (Uh-oh!)
Crush hoes A1 (true)
And I still pour A1 sauce on my shit
I come from the bottom (Poppin the bottles!)
Crushing all these hoes, swinging all this ice
Selling all these O, nigga, I did it twice
So I'm just hanging around in my Rolls, about to get on my bike
Just to land on my hood and put that on my life
I'm like, nigga, I'm there nigga, I dance hard all year, nigga
My diamonds are clear nigga, hit my chain, dead nigga
But all my dogs get killed, and all my dogs get tough, fuck it
Ass like Nicki, but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall, I buy her all kinds of designers
YSL, Chanel flies, all that Dolce & Gabbana
I jump back like 36, I lean hard when I turn the whip
If I don't have my rap deal then I'm still serving bricks
My gold foil costs 60 shelves, my rose gold costs 40
I get A1 money, I'm a nigga A1
I got an A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
Because I have A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I have A1 credit, A1 hoes
I drive A1 whips and wiggle A1 clothes
A 24-year-old millionaire.
Don't read the contract 'minus a mill there
A1 credit, park my car with your legs bowed
I got a bus full of bitches, I call him Jay-rome Bettis
I grab my dick in the picture, you'll be cutting out the picture
I let you scrape the dishes, we're eating nigga, I'll finish
So come back, I hope you're insomniac
Sleep on me if you want to take a land nap
Bitch I'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca and then more ca-ca-ca-ca
Hit your roof until I lift your hood
So more ca-ca-ca-ca, until I know that I have
Nigga, that's a perfect VVS, and CC texts me, "What are you wearing?"
Putting it all inside your bitch, I grab her hips, that's power steering
I get A1 money, I'm a nigga A1
I got an A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate nigga
Because I have A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I have A1 credit (credit), hoes A1 (hoes)
I drive A1 whips and put on A1 clothes, I'm gone!
I mean, getting to the money is all we know
Amid the drought trying to move that snow
Get that lap, that pile, that mass
Hit that bitch sideways and hit that hoe
Toolie on deck wherever we go
Fucking every bitch in [?]
I spit that shit has a smooth flow
I fly by hoes like he's
We already catch like it's a sport
I already shine like armor, but I still like the ball on the court
Ally-oop, a little bitch, Omelly hit her for the score
Now is my time and I'll shine like I'm a fucking Audemar
Trick, ball, like there's no tomorrow
Fuck your main bitch and I probably won't call her back (not at all)
Sucking and handcuffing her like she broke the law
While I'm whipping all these hoes like I'm trying to turn a car
Back in the flow, I was killing that shit
It's been about a week since you've been on that brick
Nigga from the north side, I'm still on that shit
We all fuck her, you feel like that bitch
You're still in that bitch
Running for hoes like Reggie bush
We blow that purple jelly, baby, I don't know what Reggie looks like
Damn, it's all kinds of cargo
In some [?] Shitty county
Fucking with these bitches man
Looney Tune, Goony Goon, stepping on my Louie shoes
Your bitch is on the dick, give me inside my movie theater
Money money half a thousand, chase it like track and field
Me and money Jack and Jill, we are together all the time
Black and gold Jaguar that looks like a copper top
Duracell, sale on the corner, killing shit like [?]
Oschi, Oski, Gold Rollie under lock and key
It doesn't bother me, I spend the shit I did in '03
Whole key, half [?], Feeling like a hammer song
Too Legitimate To Quit Can't Touch This Gavel Law
Niggas wanna see me fall, bike without a foot
Pocket change, diamond ring, shit looks like a hockey rink
Flame sing, loud song, hit that black earth ball
Standing tall like John Wall
Omelly the whole crew is changing phone booth, phone booth
Young and I get it, young and I get it
I just want the money, you guys can keep them bitches
Because I am young and I understand it, I am young and I understand it
Ok i get up in the morning and see dollar signs
I have money in my pocket and my Audermar shines
So why do you hate me? Hey, I'm just living my life.
I'm just young and I get it, young and I get it
Young and I get it, young and I get it
I just want the money, you guys can keep them bitches
Because I am young and I understand it, I am young and I understand it
Yeah young nigga I get money and fuck hoes in my spare time
He doesn't fuck the first night, then he doesn't meet my deadline
Niggas smoking that Bob Marley, that Bob Marley like yeah, Molly
I'm drinking all the eighth of that shit, bedtime
Shawty wants that Molly, and I'll get what she ordered
Tats everything on my body, tied like a war
Eat the pussy prolifically, if it smells like water
His talk on the neck says fuck me, my talk on the wrist says suck me
The niggas who say they're playing, I take your bitch Chris Humphrey
And make them buy me a black whip
Nothing less than the 6 nigga
You all run through your mouth like hoes, you all are bitches niggas
Ok i get up in the morning and see dollar signs
And Shawty wants to roll and I'm like oh man she's fine
I have money in my pocket and my Audermar shines
So why do you hate me? Hey, I'm just living my life.
Young and I get it, young and I get it
I'm just young and I don't give a shit
Because I am young and I understand it, I am young and I understand it
Main girl, I love that, and the girl of your dreams just called
I'm still representing that north side with that big P on my cap
These broken niggas don't like me, cause they say I think I'm all of that
Now come on, cop, ‘rarri, I don't need to feel sorry
Niggas claiming my flows, I took little niggas on maury
When I got on that Roll, the loot was surfing on them like Narley
Like 3 hoes like Santa Claus, saying I'm the boss, you'll interrupt
I hit you girl, by mistake, nigga, it wasn't even in my plan
I told Homie I hit him there, these niggas wanna plan everything
Know that that girl is the main thing, that shit don't like nigga, bang, bang
Yes
I'm fucking that ho, you love that bitch
You're kissing that bitch, she sucks my dick
Give me some cash, give me a whip
I'm about to 2-11 you ho dame tu bitch
Come here, talk money, you know it's here
Diamonds will be shiny
It's showing up, you know we're there
If she's not fucking with me maybe she's fucking P
If she's not fucking P, then she's probably fucking Reef
I asked him about the bitch, he said he had already hit
But now I'm fucking with that
Donald Daffy dodging that
Find her off the computer, she asks me if I know Cooner
And I'm with Kareem and I wonder what you mean?
I act like I don't know them because I know if she was going
She tells me they like their brothers
Most likely they will fuck her
Chances are one of them will text you
I return the money as if you had put it as if it were a profit
Wait yell my nigga Diddy we hit shit
Roll up the rug, give me some T-Pain
So I can fly over these bitches like Liu Kang
Louie's Belt Makes Little Bitches Melt
We're making money on the hard top shelf
I have batteries on the deck, I did it all myself
I got it and turned it over
I woke up again, I did it again
You know, look at these bitches all black
Fucking my Pradas going hard nonstop
Flying your way as an enemy What could you say?
Bad bitch on my back, let me tell you about it
First I was fucking Chris, now that bitch fucking Neef
I ask O Vasquez who told me that she was sweet
My neck was shining everything I did was one thing
So all you niggas who think they fuck hoes
And if he said that the pussy was good, then I will be hit
A dog i am a bitch
I ball I'll be in some shit
She said I don't like skinny guys, I like hoes with [?]
He stood up like [?] And ate like Chris Paul
You hit him in one night and told him to get lost
I tell him about a bitch that appears on the screen
I say I have that picture, she sent me that shit
At what time, 10:22? my shit 10:23
These hoes so sick, so crazy
I heard one of them trying to have my baby
I ball Tracy McGrady
Write that bitch down and get one and maybe
Hit her now, growl at her later
I see you pussy and pretty, that's great
You want the shoes, Bahamas and cruise
Summer you call your mom and tell her the good news
She wants shoes preferably Jimmy Choo
That drunk girl, though she happens when she fails
Maybe I had a gas when I said I had a landfill
I have to go many x many or
Many hugs many kisses many bad hoes groupies
Call I never show
Pause wait, Peedi caught the cheery bow
That's the Lamb, that's probably why it's MIA
And I don't mean Miami missing in another state
Him in some other case let's do it right
Ran into something new and ooh that tight coochi
I have to tighten my hat, it's slipping off my gat
It's wet like I just copied the package [?]
The cool girl, what about Mannie Fresh
I can't forget Ke, yell at my boy Nickles
My old G-head and all my pickled niggas
My Wall Street man almost passed out
When he discovered that Peddi was in love with Mrs. Chows
And go find another [?] Because all the Rose is gone
The goose is gone, the teapot is gone
I'm sitting on the hood of my [?]
That's Peedi Cracky half black half Puerto Rican
And when he raps you don't understand what he's talking about
I still wake up, go and get it, young man on a mission
But I'm different, I still put them on just to show them right
Used to be the dark boy but now they shine at night
I have an Omelly by my side because we both look alike
Try to keep that nigga off the field because he's being white
Dishin 'd, trying to get rich like me
20 gold chains, shit, I think I'm Mr. T
Bitches say they miss me, I never fall in love
Because they only miss the money, they know I try hard to get it
And if my niggas need it, I tell them to come get it
Because when it comes to me, they shoot like a little striker, swish
My life is more real than I can explain
Shooting assassins and stinging things
Tryna does a rockin the cake slaughter
They locked me in chains, niggas took pictures with my body
In Killadelphia there were bodies falling like rain
Where the bodies fall like rain
I say the meek will inherit the earth
So I own this bitch until I'm buried in the ground
I just roll with nigga that will take me to my hearse
Blessings for my grandmother, she took me to that church
And I don't know why, I just feel like it's me
They label me a victim but now look what I become
Or should I say he converted, I don't do it for fame
I'm from where they never made it, but I went against the current
Charges against my name, murder of my character.
Life is a bitch, she cheated on me but I married her
Dodging all the potholes, jumping all the barriers
And if she's a bitch, I feel like I just got into that pussy
Shorty wants to be a star, that's why that pussy explodes
She tries to win, so she hangs between the winners
So I take the time to pray at Mom's dinner.
Because I remember, cold nights not winter
It's not the weather, I'm talking inside of us
Because for that money, sins are committed
And friends divide, divided as division
So every day I wake up, all my attention
It's about getting that cake and staying out of jails
The system made me stronger
And being bankrupt made me hungry
Even if you put your [?] Hustle on and on
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
If you play or [?]
And if you gotta feed your kids, nigga, get it how you live
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
Zapping through traffic like [?], Also flying
Because the Parmesan outside and inside [?]
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my wrist.
I could wet your bitch and I ain't hit yet
When I see my p.o. I pissed Rosé for the piss test
She likes you not to smoke weed, it seems that you blow cheese
We make paper like we grow trees
Hoe please 40 on me like the OG
I'm already reaching that dollar
If it's not about the money, I don't even wanna scream
If you sell a million records or your block makes numbers
Even if you put your [?] Hustle on and on
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
If you play or [?]
And if you gotta feed your kids, nigga, get it how you live
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
Do you dig
It doesn't matter if it's five to nine
Or if I'm selling nine for nine
Nigga, I'm going to grind mine
And kill them like atomic bombs
Catching or hitting equals a dollar sign
Because any situation that may compromise, scammer
This money that I could never get enough of
I'm already reaching that dollar
If you sell a million records or your block makes numbers
Even if you put your [?] Hustle on and on
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
And if you gotta feed your kids, nigga, get it how you live
Let's get to that dollar, let's get to that dollar
Do you dig
And so we left
Not really, as if we were really gone
Like gone like we're too high for your niggas
I stayed as MJ we are the best
I worked this is how I got here
I'm a young boss, I worked for this place here
But enough of those things, girl, let's put this bitch
Got it, baby, we could fly to the tropics
You want it, so stop stopping
Because if I get the goodies that you are going to sing to me
Give me more (give me more), give me more (give me that) (x4)
And once my body like Tyson is going to be a [?]
Baby I'm the boss, those guys work for me
And I work for you, you bring me the work
If it works for you, you know it works for me
Just name it and I'm a cop
Baby now, what's the matter?
Wait, I'm not done yet
All my clique here wet all these girls
Because the gear change speeds up like a gear
She all in me [?] My girl about to be my ex
I'm like a baby, give me more of that
She likes to give me some of that, Shawty give me all of that
Ball that, my husband calls his phone and he likes to call back
Sit her in my spaceship and take her where the stars are
I show you things you have never seen
Because I'm always clean, give him my medicine
He said that playing, I could put you on another team
Make you my star player (and we'll be leaving later)
I'm not killa but don't push me
I look at a black man in his eyes, I tell you if he fuck
Remembering the times people overlooked me
I wanted to be a star, they lock me up behind bars
I know I'm going to shine a lot
I had no choice but to win
But the odds were against me
So I'm rolling through this bitch with my palms on my Semi
My dad died when I was young so my mom would defend me
And my sister would protect me
Now the done niggas respect me
Learn to work that scale, convert mice to grams
Now i'm the best since zaf curry in the lamb
Ocean Drive in the head drop like I'm dreaming
Skinny nigga, big dreams, a lot of pride
My cold heart like Omelly's heart when her mom died
Or cold like Tashima and Ta 'when my aunt Rhonda died
Niggas got fat when we starved, it wasn't Ramadan
But on sunny days, we don't need much time
So I'm like Tony Hawk on a skating board, I have to grind
What I wouldn't do for a dollar sign, I don't know
It's not about black money, I'm not going
Shoot him in the head now he's John Doe
Nine on me, Rondo
I turned a condo into a fucking
Once he was sentenced
At 10 years old I lost my outbursts, too many years ago it disappeared
Mama B, the mind is gone at all times, that shit is ridiculous
Bright lights and flights
Do you see what this life will bring you?
Do you see what that shit will bring you?
The world is frozen
Poncho, show him what that flame does
9 millimeters for evil, he can aim too
I've seen it all before
Seen my mom praying
Seen my B forget my name
As my brother's walls crumble
Lately it's a nightmare
Because it's a war and these people don't fight fair
Asking what it feels like to see my family living well
Proud of myself because my name lights up these Philly nights
God I hope I'm living well and I'm sorry for the tattoos
But if I go tonight, please take care of my nephews
I make the song cry
Make it drip, make it rip
I told you niggas of the scam
From the level every beat
What I get is a tear, a tear
As deuces, I will be super sporty, stealthy
I mean, I'll be with the cool kids
SRT-8 she like scrapers on a raccoon shit
I said we move shit
Eat a dick i do is this
They'll be in that thug shit
We're in that Looney Tune shit
But I let that tool spit, air something
I bet I let that tool rip, break something
Far away, we head to hunt
We'll be in that shit for real
Blowing some fruity fruit
Chain look like Juicy Fruit, Mixed Fruit Loops
Ayo where my boys, squad, hootie-hoo
Bitch out or in the circle like a hula hoop
And I spit that fire and you get tired like an inner tube
All these lying niggas
Call me pliers like I'm holding guys
You should see how I'm diving
I said tell them they don't want this
Cookie, pussy, gum shit
Bitch done, huh
Honorable C.N.O.T.E

Cheat guys, don't touch
They tied us down, slowed down
Shine shine
Yeah i'm laughing at the bank
All new Blue Benny Franks
I raised them in the tank, yeah
That guy is just a rap boy
He held my head until I passed out, woo
I was shining in Miami
They are all corn balls, they can't stand me
I set it off the panties
Takbar, that my brother, brother
She fucks me low, low
I have it on ropes, not me
She published for MCM and we like, "That black Jojo"
When we go out and see him, he always asks for photos.
I say, sir, be my savior
When it comes to getting this role
Please protect me from my enemies
Just save me and I won't save her
Yes, they are fucked up and cannot win.

I don't fuck her, she fuck me (fuck me)
5 thousand in cash and put it in, ooh
Big racks on me buzzing
I walk in Neimans, I spend 10K like nothing
I go out with the demons, they don't play with me, we cut ourselves
Woo, it was chilling Atlanta
Mix codeine with Fanta
Of them, Perccy, I have resistance
I'll monkey that banana, hoe
Get a bad bitch she'll do just what I say
Pull her fast like Uber in that Wraith
She's so bad but she says she put it on her face
I feel guilty, I might as well defend my case, hey
I say, sir, be my savior
When it comes to getting this role
Please protect me from my enemies
Just save me and I won't save her
Say Amen (Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen)

Shining, shining, shining
She dirty, I love my person
Remember those feds were on us
We used to catch them, Hondas

Shine shine
Come in, appear
Smoke one, roll up
Bad bitch, wait
Shine shine
Cheat guys, don't touch
They tied us down, slowed down
Shine shine
Yes
(Wheezy out of here)
God, God
I got more slaps than The Beatles (Beatles)
Foreign shit running on diesel, dawg
Playing with my name, that shit is lethal, dawg (Who do you say you were?)
Don corleone
Trust me, at the top you are not alone (tied)
Everyone acts like they know me, dawg
Don't just say you're depressed, you have to show me (What do you have to do?)
Bring the clip back empty (it's empty)
You asked to see the boss, so they sent me, dawg (He sent me, dawg)
It's just a lil '10 pieces for her
Just blowing it up at the mall doesn't mean we're involved
I'm not growing up playing ball, but I'll show you how the hell you gotta do it
If you really want to dance until you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go
I'm still getting bad anyway
I saw you last night, but I did it all day
Yes, many Murakami in the hallway (What?)
I have a sticky one and I keep it at my father's house
Girl, I left your love in Magic, now everything is shadow
I'm still going wrong anyway
Woah, woah, ooh, woah
Woah, woah, ah
Could fit like 80 racks in my Amiris (80 racks)
If you're fucking with my opps, just don't get close to me (get out of my way)
Put some bands on your head like Jason Terry (Brrt, brrt, ooh)
Richard Mille costs a Lambo (that's a Lambo)
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo (Extended)
For real
She said "Oh, rich rich man?" ("You rich rich")
Bitch, I graduated, call me "Big Fish" (Marlin)
That's all I want for Christmas (true story, uh)
I've had my way here, yeah I know they're done (done)
You're not living that shit you say, yeah, we know it's a cap (That's a cap)
DC, OVO, come back again, come on 'plat' (Ooh, ooh)
It's just a lil '10 pieces for her
Just blowing it up at the mall doesn't mean we're involved
I just ... what? I just ... uh, I put a Richard on the card
If you really want to dance until you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go
I saw you last night, but I did it all day
Wheezy out of here
I didn't have to kill anyone
Today was a good day
I didn't have to kill anyone
I didn't have to kill anyone
T-Raw killa, that nigga catpillar
A hitter, just hit the bad bitches which is thriller
King Hakim, YM last king
Nigga screaming, I need a Jordan ring
Gotti after life
Bright future, bitches break the tongue in the pipe
I don't want to see you twerk, we talk about that shit life
I have an Asian ho, pussy goes deep, Jerry Rice
I'm a black drug addict, I give a D, drug dealer
Don't play with the gravedigger, that's RZA
Aks my bitch, she tells you you're not black
Like the one I have, cock play gorilla
Bag in my bag like a Philly nigga clip
Nigga with attitude, my enemies are 2 shits
Don't give him 2 shits but you're gonna make a nigger throw it
But shit
Shoot yourself in your memory bank, memorize it
Today was a good day
No i didn't have to kill anybody
But I shoot you in your memory bank, memorize it
Adhesive tape, adhesive tape
Cover your mouth with tape
Look at a nigga like a damn update
I catch a case, I want to know who threw it
And my main bitches speak fluently
I have the bread, I have never fed pigeons
Even though I get mad I shit on all of you
Let's drink champagne from your skull
I got my girl her studded shoes, volleyball
Fuck Holygrove, it will be a holocaust
Hoes see me glowing, now they act like a moth
YMCM, why am I always busy
I got too big for the crown to fit
But I got my niggas with me and we got our skateboards
TTYL, thank you, thank you Lord
Amen, because uh
My friend hit me yesterday, I have 15 keys
And let them go for 15 G
She said she wants a perc I look at her like a bitch please
And I show that like you're not trying to flip these
Yeah i'm back nigga
And if my friends sell you one, you better say no shit to anyone
I tell you that I turned black
Rockin 'all these jewels and I'll go through my hood like I got nothing to lose, shit
You are thinking that because I rap I will not go buy bricks
How to get a point, then put a point in
I fuck my main ho and all my friends joined
But they said they want my mind, my soul and my body.
And I looked at that crazy nigga and then I shot him (BAH)
Yes turn on the lights
Yes turn on the lights
Turn on the lights
These hoes are working, these hoes are working
These hoes are acting and these niggas are leaving them
These hoes are working, these hoes are working
And these niggas will leave you
I crushed them hoes, I never loved them hoes
And these niggas are sweating them
Because I run shit, like Edgerrin
And at the bottom of my sneaks are red, man
And I'm not talking about damn Meth and them
Stay Louis Vuitton and I super grind
VS stones, super shine
I appear a Perc, I get super high
And I drill your bitch, root canal
I rock Tom Ford, Concords
And I shine on these ten-cent whores
This bitch bought me a Rolex
And I still don't have time for her
These hoes are acting
These niggas are acting tough
I'm in the ghost, I'm receding
And I'm down but I'm tied like shit
So hold your horses, polo horses
Aston Martin, we shot at Royces
These hoes are acting and these niggas are leaving them
These hoes are acting and these niggas are leaving them
These niggas will leave them, these niggas will leave them
These niggas are leaving them, and I'm not sweating them
These hoes are working, these hoes are working
These hoes are acting
Look, I don't practice much
Gold albums by word of mouth
Bottles of gold behind us.
These jones break like shit
She has her arms crossed even on the phone
I'm like what the fuck is she here for?
These hoes are acting
These niggas keep on sending them
Please, friend, you have me laughing
I never spent more than one night with her
Because you can hit my phone like four in the morning
And I say, ha, I told you, word
These hoes are working, these hoes are working
These hoes are working, these hoes are working
These hoes are acting and these niggas are leaving them
These niggas are leaving them, and I'm not sweating them
These hoes are working, these hoes are working

Take me to the bank and tiger
This clothes ten piles and more
These drums 100 bullets and more
Bitch blow me like a trumpet
Money, money, money (ah!) Ha
These hoes are working, these hoes are working
These hoes are working, these hoes are working
These hoes are acting and these niggas are leaving them
These niggas will leave them, these niggas will leave them
These niggas are leaving them, and I'm not sweating them
These hoes are working, these hoes are working
Snippet lyrics
Tell me and my dogs [?], Feeling like that (Ooh Yeah)
Tre pound, crack crown
Meek Milly, hound
Dirty, thirsty, that's what you heard me about
Dazzling on deck
Whole clip thirty
My thugs, they shit on you
Nah nigga, I'm not trying to hear you
And I don't need four pounds because I'm not trying to scare you
I just take the raw girl, I get up close to you
Action 40 bloody lightning bolts near you, tear you apart
Although dyed with them
We turn to block my Mr. Softee, I see you as a domino
Simon says he wants you dead, I say you have to go
So we drop some shit on you Geronimo, ASAP
Make that nigga Diddy bop take that, take that
Send him on a journey without a space package, lean
My hood like crazed thugs
Where Ernie said he doesn't want meat, he wants a cow
A fool with them tools we don't even allow him to touch them
Get strange with the heaters, he will try to fuck them with his fingers
Niggas crawling on my main patio, looking out the window
Bird hunting as the weapon game on Nintendo
I wish I was there, although I probably would have let them in
And stretch one of them black like a limo
Tryin 'to score a touchdown, nigga fuck and catch an INO
Cause I'm never going to sleep n-o, nizzaw
I can't be behind me because I have my back to the magician
Gat on my drizzaws, ready to clap izzoff
They are going to assassinate me, so first I have to assassinate them
And I'm going to kill his cousin brother, he first
Give niggas work, chest work
They say that is the best job.
So I'm going to kill them like an expert, tise
Aiming at Chu and my Mac Gon sneeze
My fridge put you frozen
Get out of here
We make them niggas well and get out of there
I'm loading the oo-wop
Listening to 2Pac
One hundred grand, everything out of the difficult
I don't fuck with rappers all of you frauds
Calling all cars, AR-AB has a gun
Crack in the bag because AR-AB has a child
And had to eat, by any means
I have two demons, fuck a hoop dream
Getting to the NBA is an impossible dream
They end up smoking rock out of the pipe screen
Forty-four with long nose Scott Pippen
I put it on the line, I put it on my mom
I've been shooting niggas ever since they put it on my palm
Put it in my hands, they cooked grams
Where I'm from all the drug dealers was the man
I'm a legend in jail, and I catch streets
They speak to a deaf man, forty in my left hand.
Give him a black wig and then find the next man
I shoot until the technical jam, then step [?]
A lord takes my soul if AR-AB [?]
Tryin to steal AR-AB niggas begging to die
Years in the cell, I called my little brother
He hit both witnesses, then I was acquitted
I'm talking about your children, I make them show ribs
My gun is so big that it took off his whole head
Yeah so if you talk about me then you're talking about money
Don't even drop my name if you're not talking about hunnids
Me too, you too (I have to get it, I have to get it)
If you really don't know me, I know I'm running a hundred miles
Looking for the best stop is the way a nigga shoots
Me too, you too (I have to get it, I have to get it)
Me too, you too (I have to get it, I have to get it)
Look, you do to me, friend, right?
If it is real, it recognizes a true black who
Looking all black all in them 22's
Cause I'm getting to the money and my arrogance through the roof
I have this enemy that seems funny, no matter what they do
But if they say they get money, tell 'em niggas show the proof
Now if you're talking about this then we're talking about it
We are not talking about shit if we are not talking about batteries
We're not talking bitches, nigga, forgive me [?]
Put all my dick in her mouth, you find out, you're a loser
Ha ha, I said young man about his role
Get to money like mahfuck an enemy
My glock in my my block in
I stop at six you know the top is gone
It seems a center of attention where I put my watch
We're making movies, bitch, we got your popcorn
I bet you heard I get money, I'm a certified G
I'm a nigga from the north side but you know I'm
On the south side with my niggas hitting the money
I woke up early in the morning where the bread
Hollywood to MIA you know I did that
And when it comes to Philly nigga, I know what that is
I am receiving money, they pay me
Huh, I'm getting money, they pay me
Watch them niggas hating to cast shadow
I make you
I make you
I make you
And the only man person, can make you fall in that particular place, is yourself
You can't trust the shit of the outer man to affect you
Shit you have no control, it should never affect you
I feel like I lost my soul, selling you fucking hoes in the drug game
And we did it all double cross, triple cross for love of cocaine
Triple joists, put me on these Balmain jeans
Yeah this is treacherous nights, Killadelphia dude shit
Squeeze your thirties when you go to sleep
All we know is armed violence (armed violence)
Go to jail, come back and now your son is wild (He is wild)
Sitting on the couch with his grandmothers, he smells like gunpowder (shit)
Yee, Yee, all we know is gun violence (that's all we know)
He just smoked a nigga ample day, don't give a shit (Hrr)
Now the murder has gone to his head, he's rushing for it (hurries)
They're not fucking with me, New Orleans N.O
Old school bitch I let her fly like nintendo
Black Panamera, Mac and I are on fire
Lane change at that 5 percent tint on windows
I got 20 in my pocket, 30 on my wrist, 50 on my neck, keep it 100 on this bitch
And I was never walking, I'm just running at your choice
I say my swagger at infinity, money is not a limit
Real nigga every day, from start to finish.
You should hear this roar when I'm starting the engine
Sounding like a lion motherfucker barking all over
Earn a dollar every second, thousands an hour
Pause
I'm getting to that, niggas wasting shit, I'm a boss
Me and Gucci Poochy, shooting at the tables
When I was broke I used to have a dream
Before I had a dream I think I had demons
Continually exploiting my celly, trying to get any means
My nigga passed out in the kitchen working on the triple joists
Breaking ounces of the little bird, money was dirty
And that's the word for Osama
Leaning from the prometh, drinking Aunt Jemima
Rollie all parked, call that perfect moment
Tell my jeweler to freeze me, just to change the weather
At the foot of the mountain and Meek Milly got the climb
My booty flies shit, your booty, norbit
Nigga you're a weirdo, nothing's lost
Cooler on your stereo, I don't think they hear me
I used to sell them little O's, I'm not talking cheerios
I'm talking about those golden graham grains and I don't eat cereal
Killer plus I'm more real this is scarier than thriller
And my flow will be in other shit
Hotter than an oven
I just got your girl's number, he's gonna need another bitch
Make her fuck my other bitch, then punish her
She said she was in love with me and that she didn't know my government
Shorty stumbling where his luggage in
Broken niggas never saw me cause I'm where the money
All I know is hustle, like a pack of a hundred
A nigga get my jewels, I'm going to kill him and I don't want them back
Take them to your funeral, atrophy while they see you
Mom wouldn't notice, it's like what the hell they do to you
Yeah nigga, I'll ruin you
Stop messing around with these niggas, get on that dirty shit
Let them know that Meek Milly is still black
Listen to that
Old money new job
Can you smell the crack smell on my new shirt
A two hearse car shooter
They messed them up, made them black on the news first
The niggas think that because I'm rapping I won't slide over them niggas with that ratchet
Most of you ass niggas will ratify
The consequences make them feel the drum
That's a real talk about that dirty shit
Ask for [?]
I tell him to pass it and he will pass it
And when it comes to questions, he won't do a thing
I understand everything [?]
Do you really want that
On that role, my nigga Oschi will be on your first step
This is how a hitta gets it
About that money, my nigga CP will be in your window
And Omelly will be in your bitch place
With a big glock trying to get the big drop
As soon as you come get the pussy, you're gonna catch a shot in the head
Aww yeah
Play around, watch the waiter put him to bed
The best thing you say now I don't think so
Don't let pride weigh you down, you'll sink slowly
Checking my new you should be checking the bank rolls
I really am that nigger to fuck without time
I'm in a sauna climbing a flame
My baby mom is trying to find out if I'm in any drama
I'm sleeping on top of the sheets
Shutter locks
I'm going through it wondering why I'm not gonna fuck her
I'm putting on [?]
Black sweatshirts and skullys wiggles in cellophane
Roll up the puff pastry and pass it
Insert the ratchet
Five be in your area
Second floor room trying to see your brother
Blew it [?]
Cooling down on your way out taking off soon
Skrrrr first grab CL
Direct to the condo all DL
When I put on my label I put on that mask
Still ride or die [?] Drag
I used to run it in many grams that I would add
Drake shit better I was 40 in my jet lag
You only know that you're playing your role as a stepfather
Don't worry if that tec gets stuck
Those niggas come in packages and then we hit them all
See my son had a dream with a bird
SK shot had the sidewalk chipped
Diesel and syrup drinking
Out of town make a presence when I'm not around
There is no cause for them to buckle and walk
My nigga Doc is in your mom's crib
My nigga Wiz will be in your mom's crib
That black Snoop will be in your mother's crib
Neighbors with the look of what your mother did
With that Parabellum, nine holes let them all go
Run this shit like Marlow
Turn that man on like Waldo
Oh carpet
I'm going hard in the paint
We don't even have to talk about it
Shorty standing there, fatter than Rasputia
I play for the dream team, I go out with the coolest kids
Watch out for my Louie belt because that's where my Ruger is
I leave you alone black, what the hell do you think black?
Five presidents in that Lincoln presidential nigga
Gold presidential out the window black nigga finger
Fuck them all up, that's how I feel
Shitting on these niggas without a deal
My money is fine, I'm super strapped
Talking all that hammer shit where your tool is
Ask for the city that we will do that
We are going to move all that sour white diesel
That's the word for my thirty six O
In thirty days I'm trying to fuck thirty rich hoes
I'll keep spitting out that flamerz like thirty-six stoves, woah
North side until the death of me, definitely
Cameron with black stripe, referee preferably
I feel and I'm not ecstatic
But the groupies are and you can tell by how they bothered me
She is going to suck my cock, she is going to suck it too
She's Going To Fuck Omelly, And She's Going To Fuck The Crew
Now she fuck with me, she don't fuck with you
And that's crazy, you know that was your damn boo
That's the reason you hate
Let the streets say what they want 'cause I'm caking up
Shout out to all the niggas who thought I wouldn't make it
They the most fake hating while I was in the basement
Where I come from, getting money is the object
I get mine setting fire to the pyrex
Fuck a record that I bring you straight
I kill you, then the witness dies later
44 Bulldog is a 5x
You never progress if you only bet sideways
I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone
I just caught two birds but one left
I supply it well, that's my clientele
I shoot projectiles if any of my clients says
Until then I'm just trying to make an income
Razor blade on a plate full of waste
Being broke like you is what I'll never do
The purple juice and the Xans made me sleep walking
She say niggas like me that she doesn't see often
And I don't care if he fired, I keep sparkling
I make niggas throw towels and make peace offerings
I only give them bank notes and tell them to keep walking
I only show a bitch money, I don't keep talking
Then she wobbles on my knob like she's late
Sour D 4 grams filled in Dutch
Fifty large rubber bands tucked into the cut
Two bitches four hands touching my nuts
Then I give them a long cock touching their insides
If money is the subject, I understand it like Floyd
I am OG, moving grams of the [?]
If I don't know niggas, my hand on the toy
Because I'm a fucking shooter, Brandon Roy
I just blow well, I smoke the L's 550
You are not a real connection if you cannot supply fifty
My cousin Nas stays halfway because he will die with me
O.B.H know the set and let's 'get ours'
I was in the crack house with eight vowels
You were like Eminem off eight miles
In your shit house writing rap songs
I used to run niggas home with my mac on
I guess you just need a microphone like Nas
I'll take a full pound on a white cake
Glock 30 compact which is the correct size
I'm talking about brick sales, place your order
I cook mine dry I don't like it watered
Hating is a weak emotion.
A sign of failure
Nigga, stop hating, take off your ass
Worrying about the next nigger, that will cost your ass
Go get in your nigga and get off the pad
Slowly grind to the top, but you're falling fast
Can you hate me
Boyyy
I hate me, I'm a volunteer
Locked at the highest level
Trying to get out of there
This is the house where the failure of
Future I'll fly out of here
Some of us will make it, buddy
Some niggas will die here
Yes, but there is no hate to get you out of here
Hating blacks never prosper, hating I gotta stop you there
Niggas who got to the top, they start to hate and then they drop down from there
Yes, get the black money, why do I hate it?
There's no time to hate, only the money on my mind remains
Hate is the leading cause of murder and the crime rate.
Yes they are my motivators
Every time I see I'm a take because I know what they expect
They wait for the day that I fall, but hate won't work at all
Nigga, stop hating, take off your ass
Worrying about the next nigger, that will cost your ass
Go get in your nigga and get off the pad
Can you hate me
Hate is my motivator
Boyyy
Lebron never makes it to the NBA for hating
He did it out of dedication, ambition and motivation.
In addition to what they say
Niggas voicing opinions
Those niggas can only judge me on the day of my end judgment
They judge me from the beginning
However, I hate it, but it's great
They give my engine gasoline, adding fire to the fuel
I'm a flyer that all these guys
They see it, that's why they hate
I am grinding because I am shining, they are grinding because they are in a state
I am grinding because I have to pay my bills.
I don't hate solving my problems, why would I hate?
I will get it
That's the word for Robby and my aunt Terry
Some of my enemies hate, that's why I keep them close to me
And when they hate me, they feel like they're cheering
Nigga, stop hating, take off your ass
Worrying about the next nigger, that will cost your ass
Go get in your nigga and get off the pad
Slowly grind to the top, but you're falling fast
Hate is my motivator
Boyyy
Hating is a weak emotion, a sign of failure
Puffin in that purple, the same color as Donatello
That hatred will lead to your disappearance. I'm trying to tell you, son.
Ayo, is this him? We are all caught up in our own sins. Sometimes I have to remind myself that on my worst day, I live like someone at their best, and so do you. Don't let your demons take you to hell. Present them to heaven!
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some go to heaven, some go to hell
No one wants to lose, no one wants to fail
No one wants to die, no one wants to kill
The things we do just to survive
But nobody wants to lose, nobody wants to fail
No one wants to die, we are just trying to live our life
They said that he would not make it or that he would never see the throne
And my baby mom hates me because she said I did it wrong
‘Because I left, to pursue my dream, to achieve it in any way
I said I'd come back, she wasn't listening to me
That back and forth discussion was getting in the middle
I said fuck other niggas, I'm gonna go find him with my team
If we all work, we all shine, we fuck part time
I used to play the block early in the morning and in the dark
Now they are G5 flights, fuck at the time of departure
It was hard times, nigga, now is our time
‘Because I was on your streets, my heart was cold like an ice pack
Every night we tie up like we're in Iraq to fight
‘Because niggas are killed by a block that makes a pile per night
Whoa, I have to get home with my son
Over them papers with a firm grip on your gun
Before I speak they have to burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole in the sun
In the neighborhood, there is no loyalty, there is no world for your daughter
There is no life for your brother, in my mother's life
I'm right, nigga, you're absolutely right!
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some go to heaven, some go to hell
No one wants to lose, no one wants to fail
No one wants to die, no one wants to kill
The things we do just to survive
But nobody wants to lose, nobody wants to fail
No one wants to die, we are just trying to live our life
Right now I am praying that my son will get this scholarship
As for the hood, I recognize it
But who is not a snake is usually a follower
Luckily I can tell the difference
My man comes home, my other man is sentenced
Soft niggas generally send hatred through bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hate your photos
Without working for it, you don't always find riches
Some niggas find coffins, others just find ditches
D-block, finish that and copy more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you have enough cigarettes, we can all smoke
There's nothing good when everyone broke up
Never fear a man if he also bleeds
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the devil, he's transparent
No one wants to lose, no one wants to fail
No one wants to die, no one wants to kill
The things we do just to survive
No one wants to die, we are just trying to live our life
I had that bad bitch with me the other night
She is going to ask me why I never go to sleep because I was awake
You know what I said to him ho
I won't sleep until I touch a hundred million
Bitches know what they do when we go up to the building
The neck says great but my wrist says relaxing
Stuntin 'so strong it could hurt a feeling of hatred
Grind hard and then shine hard, that's the motto
You know, whether it's going home or going hard
You only live once and I'm a ball until I fall
We just stopped you at your enemies that look like a car show
I made a hundred thousand dollars and blew it
I made another hundred thousand dollars and went through it
Every time I get it, spend it like nothing
If I see it and I like it, I'm like Nike, I just do it
I just copy it, I just drop it [?]
Gucci Louis Polo [?]
Breitling Rollie Audemar
Fuck, I want everything
Kobe, although I'm a bitch
Addicted to money, I guess I'm lazy then
I'm not going to sleep until I'm rich (what did you say that ho?)
I won't sleep until I'm rich
All those bitches know their money when we step on this bitch
They say there is nothing that sleeps more than a dream
And I haven't been sleeping since I was seventeen
Money you have never seen
Cemetery displacing it
Late night getting
All about the youngest
Break the job, let Pyrex heat up
Hit my young men to count the money with my feet up
Let them sleep hating nigga D
I won't sleep until I touch a hundred million
They say there is no murder. I say I kill them.
Talking about that paper money to the ceiling
Relax then, no time to hug and kiss
Just hurry up and [?]
You're tired like Michelin
I'm awake like all night counting my percentages
Catch all day and serve demons like this was tennis here
I won't sleep until I'm rich as the doorman
Looked at it with a dollar turned it into four quarters
I rush like I have three sons and four daughters
I'm porridge burning hot
You hate if you say I'm not
I buy that shit that you say you have
Hustle, I don't play much
Dawg, I let my arrogant talk, I don't say much
Hurry up and come back five times. I never save much.
Word
I won't sleep until I'm rich black
How are some of you niggas going to sleep?
I do not understand them
'Cause I'm not going to sleep until my bank account in the fucking seven, eight digit black
You already know
Meek Milly Flamerz
I gave this hustle all I have (which I have)
I always kept it real from the beginning (beginning)
Niggas ain't thorough as I always thought
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas said they were with you when they really weren't (really they weren't)
Niggas plot everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Uh, I kept it more hackneyed from the start
Since so many people came across me, I don't know where to start
Yes, still in those papers, they won't let me out
I never thought we'd get out of the ghetto, now look where we are
I gave these niggas everything and that was from the heart
Rollie, chain, every car, all he did was leave me scarred
I heard my dog talk behind my back and I'm like letting him speak
I won't say his name, but he went to feel this shit in every bar
Was it really worth it?
Cut the grass and all the snakes surfaced
Nobody is perfect
I showed them cash, it made me a little nervous
Maybe i'm stumbling
Waiting for this paranoia of all this shit we've been on
I saw you pour gasoline and you burned all your bridges
Fuck it!
I gave this hustle all I have (which I have)
Niggas ain't thorough as I always thought
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas said they were with you when they really weren't (really they weren't)
Tears fall like water when liens fall
Boyz in the Hood, these screaming Tre 'niggas let me out
No, they are not riding, it was drama, I am as if we were out
Trying to please these niggas, the shit went neat
I go crazy, I've been alone lately
40 on my belt lately, I don't need no help lately
Nigga crossed me, I cut it off and I felt crazy
Because I have a purple heart
Shit, I'd rather work and walk before riding fancy with niggas that don't fuck with me
I'm starting to hate this shit of fame look what it did to me
Since half of these niggas turned them back when the rappers tried to come for me
I don't want them in my company, I just want to be a company
Dreamcatchers, chasing dreams
Hate is false and love is real.
Niggas said I wouldn't win, I said yes, damn, I will
I went out to the studio with all my feelings and I let them spill
Forever thorough, be a nigga sucka, no I never will (No!)
I gave this hustle all I have (which I have)
I always kept it real from the beginning (beginning)
Niggas ain't thorough as I always thought
Damn, the game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas plot everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Uh, my heavy heart, my cleanest soul
When the little one had a big head, it was like Hol 'Gina
I had the whole squad on, I had the city exploding
I told my dog not to listen to them, to get caught up in that gossip
They want to see you in the neighborhood when you don't have shit
Then it all went wrong, this little thing of ours
I always kept it real from the beginning (beginning)
Niggas ain't thorough as I always thought
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Niggas plot everything you got (everything you got)
The streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)
Here we go again (x6)
In the Bent fitted to the back
Stop at the club and then we get in the back
Shawty show me love, she let me get it from behind
And if I hit him in the back, you won't get it back
I say my arrogance in the subway
Limited with that though
My pockets like a gecko
Shit greener than [?]
Look at a nigga like FEMA
If you try, you are a dreamer.
I ended up fucking with Christina Fatima Karina
Rollie on my wrist Rollie on that bitch
She rolling over that shit we're about to throw at this bitch
Did you get Rover to be that bitch and we got to my [?]
I let her roll onto my crib and then she rolled onto my cock
Now that bitch got into a Kelly Rowland dilemma
Tell Omelly to turn around, we start rolling with that bitch
Frutie rolls up on that bitch
And we get taller than a fucking roller coaster out of this bitch
My flow is not stupid, it is delayed
You can't stand it because you start it
I'm hotter than the wasabi copy
I'll be at Bally's prolificity in Cali
With Charlie in the Mazi
I'm Louied to the ground
My layman will be more brown than Bobby
The highly respected city
My girl will be hotter than Halle
I see you heard from me
I can see the madness
These niggas are crazy because we got that cash
And stacking the caddy car looks like a Magnum
We add them making these enemies hate your stomach
Man they'll be like who he is
Check my Louie V
Check my Louie shirt, Louie belt, Louie sneaks away
Ask if I'm cool if
Hell Raiser sitting on the Trail Blazer SS
Nigga super sport 'about to chirp
Niggas hitting shit and they got that job
In your brand get ready, we are preparing
All these niggas drop a lot of spaghetti
I'll be popping my banger keeping it steady
Let the semi pop burn your chest like a shot from Henny
Explosion, breaking his top looking at his [?]
Asking, I'm like Arnold baby, what's going on?
Breaking, Rollie's studded face is just a blink
Fashion, D&G skully matches my jacket
Breaking, we've got it busting baby, what's going on?
Fuck a shoe box, I need a safe like baseball
Let my tool explode, take off your face and take off
A brown drop, blacks can't see me like Ray Charles
Niggas making it explode, take away the tools
Halfway in a house halfway
But it's like I'm halfway but I'm halfway
I swear it's a blessing to be halfway
But [?] I'll be back
I have to make my curfew, I can't be halfway
Because if I'm halfway, I'm halfway
Yes, we return to the neighborhood
(Philly, what's up?)
I remember there were no lights
Mattress on the floor
Yes, I remember there were no lights.
Mattress on the floor
Yeah I remember every cold night (I do)
Niggas sold white just to live Lo Life
Ralph Lauren, I was sinning
The crazy part is that the designer doesn't want to send it
The drug dealer was out of my mind
And it's not magic, you can't imagine
Either you spit it raw, or you sell crack and you haggle the ball
It's crazy when I saw my own neighbor hitting the soft
I was thinking in my head like I had to come up with this crude
She is thinking like this and what
My friend got cold
He even sold a nintendo, I'm thinking like hol 'up
I've seen my homie mommy become a zombie
And it was like New Jersey Drive the way we shot Johnny
Slide like a bowling ball
I have nowhere to go at all
Got the money and the power, made a strong nigga
I had respect before that
Because they always taught me that
A nigga hits you, you hold that
Down baby now it's thirty rounds baby
As I ride through my hood
He's gone crazy on this bitch
Where they kill for half a pound baby
So imagine for a kilo
Shark in the water, Nemo
Skinny niggas with a full pound turn to Deebo
I have all four five and all six call it cee-lo
Niggas will talk about murder, that's not so
Fuck what the niggas tell us, I see them and I know they're jealous
Walking in my Margielas, this girl like my umbrella
Ballin 'like it's Melo
And reign like Coretta
Eighteen in my beretta and singing I will never
We are shooting all of you pussies
Ringing in all of you niggas
My body body for body
My finger all on the trigger
I'm ready, my heavy niggas
Yellow gold all in my prezi
I feel like I'm Andretti
I'm Freddie all in your dreams
My team full of gorillas
Assassins on 4 wheels
Fresh off the nigga tour
They want to see my passing
You want to see me out of a job
Do you want to see me back in the corner?
With helicopters like fuck the cops
They want to lock us in boxes
Courts and teleprompters
Jealous that I'm not jealous
They are jealous that I don't tell them
I'm focused no I'm not failing
Propelling in the sky
They jealous made him a nigga
I don't understand all of you
Let me tell you what I've been through
Kenny Lee on the track
The way that I'm flowing
Keep it going
I rip the beat and then sew it up, back together
Rap forever, it's Philly
I'm in the porsche drop, 911 Porsche box
They can never eat me like a muslim and a pork chop
Of course not, I'm dunkin 'until the court falls
Like B. Grif, like shit and hoarse blocks. SAY AH!
Flame spitta you're a lame nigga
You can't compare a G4 to a jet black
That's like seeing a pedal bike on a black train
Like Earl Boykins and let Lebron James hit it HA!
Has no sense
How your label ejects you as if you had not paid any rent
I've always been a star player, I don't play a bank
Let these hoes be hoes
I'm not saying no bitch NAH!
Legs in the pig, but I'm going to HAM
Riding on the beat like a mother fucking lambo
Hard as X with a '98 camshaft
Sigel in the Roc, Nas in ilmático
I'm still on it
No matter my choice, I know Phil stands behind him and gets cold with him
Ruffle than most, but good with it and still hood
Honor roll swag very well
Diamond all around your neck but your album is made of wood
Money my medicine will make me feel good
They lock me up in a cell, no matter I'm still standing
As tall as Yao Ming, Gasol, Bynum, and Shaq
I'm rockin 'with Rozay, now they know I'm back
I'm talking about those 360 batteries
360 days with 5 more I keep working
In my bag [???] put shine
Bail money only thing I dropped a penny
I tell them to go up to the level I'm on
Someone call the firefighter just to cool me down
I'm smoking i'm really not kidding
Automatically hitting because they really don't smoke
Put them on the booth kapoof Hokus Pokus
I do magic, like the magic of the lake
But they drowned them in the water in Lake Placid
And I have bars like it's taking me to jail
When they let me out of jail, I took a cell
I don't have to drop an album, make a tape to sell 50
I will be at the stand, tell your artist to follow me
They got a nigga on trial, they told me I killed the beat
They feel my pin and my pad, my fingerprints on the sheet
IMPORTANT: Rap Genius already has a version of this song:
URL: http: //rapgenius.com/Dj-ill-will-cypher-lyrics
I said it was Kid Ink, baby, I went back to the Maxx as T.J.
Body labeled as the highway background
Play in the lock that niggas need to get a key
'About to roll sticky kush like Elmer's
Go to the head with me? Bring a damn helmet!
You niggas just Special Ed,
All I see is green but my eyes are so red
And all I do is win, I have a room full of clouds
'About to take another shot, but I'm used to fouls
I'm playing you could put two in your mouth
Tell them deuces, just put two in the air
So sick he said it must be the flu in the air
If you do it big then I made it obese
I wake up all night, rising more than a nosebleed
I swear I was raised by beasts like Mowgli
Rats and roaches came from the bottom
Now the blunt niggas ain't as fat as my roaches
I'm a shark in the water, I see the fin and it's over ...
It's time for me to wake you up
Counting all these damn Bennies
Until I cut a paper
Kill the competition
I bombard them and then invent them
When the 'caution' tape is up,
Say ah! That dead record, I remember
Spitting out that crack, this really is drugs
You like an irritating fly; I'm killing your buzz
I'm eating the beat, this is Pacman
I'm in the rut like a damn lap dance
Erry nigga 'round me: robbin' - Batman
All the black coupes, all the black wheels
Run, move or take off your fucking cap
Rolling in this murder engine
Purrin 'around your neighborhood
Let my money speak
I don't have to say that I'm fine
Goonies who will shoot you
Ridin 'like a motor bitch
I don't have to say I'm a bell ...
I tell a ho to follow me or swallow me
I'm spending money like I'm going to the lottery
If I ever hit your girl then this is my apology
Because suckas are stumbling
I'm about to leave: on my arm
Leader winning, I could feel it now
The Taliban take you down by building
High dick blocker, I'm a fly shot
In my range all red like a high Prada top
And life would be leaking
From my lips as I spit that shit out
Hungry as a victim of theft and poverty
With a Roscoe 'waffle and chicken'
With the doctor who killed Mike
Shine in the field now watch me kill all the field mice
I'm anthrax, Tampax, I'm about to go to Amtrax
Back off, I'm an antagonist
Hitting your fagots by putting a can in the car is:
Swag of the century, mack in a bitch or three
I heard the head was nothing, I was trying to break it eventually
Rappers mention me, boy, I put this on my mom
You will finish Interscope, I'm just trying Warner Brother
Still getting cheesecake with these mannequins
Deal or No Deal, I received a briefcase full of money
Jahlil on the beat, will house this shit
Already bitch in the rent, she put my dick in her dental
You know my bitch is a yellow bone, in Yellowstone
Double spoon, chocolate women in my vanilla cone
Screaming because I'm gone, yeah I'm on a cherry pit
Things seem faster than pinging your Berry phone
You don't want to talk about dancing bar-e-ly Larry Holmes
Veteran, knock, knock, it's a
End you rappers like the letter after M and I'm a
Lamborghini nigga, nigga, you could never see me, I'm the one
Shhh, triple 'H'; you're going to have to pedigree me bitch I'm
Ready for meat like it's lettuce between me
You got money eenie meenie, tiny like the youngest cousin
And even if you niggas are stumbling, you still could never see me
Or beat me with three wishes and a fucking genius
Scared? It's not fair when I play a record with you
Stranger and your square; I could play checkers on you
Rap-pers, all of you actors
And I rip this track until it's tra-ck
I, skate; Let it ride
Show my televised face
Tap at the top as the lowercase letter 'i'
I fly higher than a science fiction flyer
This is a European whip to check the design of the coupe
Time is money is the building and the truth inside
Goon shoots you in the head, makes you lose your mind, really ...
He's the son of a bitch Milly, huh
I said hoes, we never love them
We fuck them and then we discuss them
And if you're not fucking my man, you're fucking my cousin
There is nothing, how do we want it?
Um, um incredible
Better yet a buffet
You can get all three
But I don't understand your number, I tell you to call me
The phone rings with her friends and they want to party
I tell him to meet me, hotel room 13
I'll be there in a bit
Looking sexy, screaming daddy, come get it
The gods of the dream tell me twice, I am right
Little wetter than a pool, I dive like I'm swimming (splash)
Hitting the bitches, daddy, this ain't nothing new
I'm shaggy baby, would you let my kids scooby doo
She said it's crazy, but I tell her this is what we do.
Rolling the block (uh)
Benjis on the rock (uh)
Bad bitch on my back, at twelve o'clock
T-5 barking at them
PT5 turns ass on them
The policemen come, double clutch, the fist tells them that corner
Drive hard, fly like a Maserati
Going down when I'm rolling, she's gonna ride, she's my Bonnie
My little mommy sweetie
Vanilla Ice, look at her eyes and her body
My little right thing
Like you're not fucking or sucking, you don't even get in the whip
She doesn't tell him to scream
Grinding, chopped in helicopters
Still M.O.B., mommy doesn't get a dollar
I'm trying to fuck you for free, if you're cheating don't even bother
I'm a P.I.M.P., naked bitches in the 'scala
Put on a blue and white Yankees shirt, striped polo shirt with collar (free)
But everyone knows my name
Also, I have that firefighter, Puff called me Lil Wayne
And I have a little game
Hoes feeling the booty of a black
Tryna fuck and suck me just to piss her niggas
Look at this, I just sit and laugh
If I get a piece of cake, my man will cut it
Breakdown, knock down, briefly keep your mouth shut
This is what we do 102, it's not about that
I don't give a shit, I leave you trapped like a mousetrap
Middle of the city, tell your gum to come with me, nigga
Female dog
Imagine giving me a slice of niggas when I can hit the dealer and buy all my killer Porsches
They will slide on you if I tell them to ride on you
Suddenly when he hit you someone lied to you
Fucking famous bitches, counting paper
Check, check, check
I have shit on you, I won't say it
Pay to look at your mouth, stay calm
I'm gonna call you bitches, don't play games with you bitches, no way
I used to call the Lord for you, now I'm swinging that cake
So if you travel with my opps then fuck off, hoe
Choppa-style thugs lurking when the sun goes down
The haters throwing bullets trying to get a touchdown
You catch them like Fitzgerald hommie when that clip spills
Beat your allure, get home, and then get killed
Because real nigga shit in Filadel
I wet you and leave a hole in your head like the killer whale
Willy and Meek Milly free
He really fights that question from a nigger who answers
Rapper actors like Samuel L. Jackson
You're throwing money, you still don't have a crib
You still don't buy that Playstation for your children
But you make it rain, you're a fucking lame
They all limp man
I am in the SRT with an ACP
My ACG sneaks got an APB
I make my bars go together like ABC
I'm the club throwing dubs drinking A-C-E, spado
I'm not talking Tony when we say yes
In the kitchen, we do miracles like your mayonnaise
We hit the block and we hit the rock like ay-o
In the grizzy, my shooters with me call them O.J. May, woah!
North Philly where am I
Dickie black hoodie with my hat P
Maserati with automatic start where the key
Where is the key i don't know
You have money, I have money, the difference is mine
How real is this
Cooling at the cut higher than a Louis label
When the biddies see me I remind them of a Gucci bag
Because they love me and they need me
I'm like Seymour, feed me
I'm making money believe me
Hoes want to pop the boy because I'm on TV
Meek Milly, I'm running this rap shit
215 we're running this rap shit
Philly, ah
I said I'm sitting here relaxing in my old school whip
Me and old Melly and my old school clique
With a 45 Volv, but some old-school shit
Light-skinned 32, that's my old school girl
Why do you hate the money I'm making?
I'm flying like [?] Before he released a statement
I'm not up front, I'm not pretending
I get up early in the morning, going hard for the newspaper
The shit out of all these rappers is like a fucking number 2
I say I'm going to pass, Rolex be blue summer
Cooler than Will B, my friends also atrophy
And I brought the mac with me, and I'm not talking about Charlie
Harley, those shells smoke you, Bob Marley
Gnarly, I'm cooler than that white boy, surfing
If you throw your girl at me, I'll catch them
Isn't it me, isn't it me?
Am I not in some shit?
Am I not fucking your bitch?
Am I not a big hustle?
Am I not fucking with TIP?
I just spit that shit out and he'll bring it back like a replay
I come from the east side, I run shit like a relay
Lots of Philly killers with me, they all look like the highway
You can catch me in the hood probably somewhere I don't belong
I'm still with my long pound
Your clip is held as 33 which are three circles of a brick
In some shit, that's your bitch
No it's not because she's ours
Stop at the club we are in at Banshees and CR
Ask us who we are
I'm a young king, I'm wassup
Ask your how I do my thing
I was locked in the corral but I still shine like I'm shining
On the block with that Yao Ming
Tryna move that white China
I'm already dying like I'm not even about to explode like dynamite
I'm that bull just call me Mike
I change the hoes like clothes
I change the O's as if they were floors
And save my money for them hoes
I keep money to recharge
I keep cash in this pile
And I just laugh Joe I like GI
Bitch I'm trying to fuck you, you still care about you
Haters can see that I'm all about my BI
Bitch I've been to loot [?]
Lotta niggas hate because we move like the mob
West Philly back block is where you find me at
State have my nigga Dean
I'm on promomethazine
Show you how we walk them
No time with them triple beams
I have a broken jaw, let my youngsters move
You see three of the subway, and they ended up with ten cents
You had your job all week, shit, I rush mine
I rush, I rush, I'm never okay
I just hit a lick, all the white bricks
Fuck the drought, we'll flip like a light switch
Ask my nigga [?] He got a [?]
We like a junkyard, we're left with metal shit
I can do it right or I can do it wrong
You buy it soft, try to cook it, you will lose houses
Neef Buck told me to take you where I fit
The Mac looks great but it's beautiful with the clip on
Disrespect and we review them as an ACG
They say your green doesn't shoot
Your target is not oil
You niggas are loyal when they shine like tin foil
Hottest in town, hottest in town
Hottest in town, no one will get over it
Hottest in town, hottest in town
Hottest in town, no one will get over it
Hottest in town, hottest in town
Hottest in town, no one will get over it
Hottest in town, hottest in town
Hottest in town, no one will get over it
Meek Milly I'm on fire
Falling on these niggas in a row I'm raining
Because top noodles like Ramen, save it
Chief Ricky Ross
Stand tall, Cindy Hall
I'm the hottest in town, got the riders niggas with me
They let me out of the cell I was opening like I was Diddy
So Omelly came to pick me up with a helicopter and a fifty
I'm like what's really good
I'm anywhere, any block, any hood
All my niggas travel hard like a hemi should
I'm gonna hit these rap niggas like a skinny should
I am your puffin area in [?]
I just want to make a little change Obama
Me and Osama
The .45 colt bursts out I'm not talking mom
Nigga I'm the one
It is understood
Shout out to Black Niro real niggas upstairs
I'm on my different shit, I can't stop, it won't stop
Send Omelly to your house with a 30 that won't stop
He'll be dirty like a floor mop
Hit you in the front row, door shots plus shots
Listen to your little speeches that you won't fall
Mixtape real niggas ain't cops
I'm in my bag, right?
40 on my hip, one up on camera
I give it to these raw niggas like Dominicans
But just like Arsenio, really semi
Bullets blow, ignite a black ass like Emilio
Niggas are sick, but I'm illy
I'm on some shit behind [?] With a nice ho
We are on the south side, but [?] North Phily
I'm so flying, all your hoes know me
Hit 'em like bitches, you're mad at us
We get paper, we hate how you did it

Yeah i gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed
So tell me how it feels
Losing what you believe
I make you drop on a Tuesday
I had the park on, poppin ', we made a movie
So many feelings involved, the way you make me
I have an opportunity to do whatever it takes
I have no time for mistakes
I see the light because I'm hazy
They tried to hug me, but I didn't.
Every time you write to me
And by the time I'm responding
It's too late
Now I feel a way, way, yes
Oh and i gave you more
Yeah i gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed
So tell me how it feels
Losing what you believe
Yes, I confess, I wasn't ready but I was under pressure
I was caught in the lights of all the jets
All the pretty hoes, the X and Os, the diamonds, VVS
They were shining, I was blinded, you were drugged like CVS
What the hell was I thinking?
What the fuck was he drinking?
Running around with these bitches
Our sinkin 'relationship (Ooh)
Half mill on your finger
I passed an Abraham Lincoln
I caught you texting that nigga
I guess you have to get revenge, damn
It was getting scarier
I never thought I'd see them times and I'd be crying
Thinking back to the times of what we were and what we have now
We build again and I will not tear down, I promise
Yeah i gave you more than you wanted (darling yeah)
I gave you more than you needed (Necessary)
Losing what you believe
It has never been upon us
You didn't say it, but you get it
You shouldn't hurt, but I but I left
I feel that things are not the same
No, I feel a way, oh-oh
And by the time I answer
It's too late
Yeah i gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed (Oh right)
So tell me how it feels
This is how we roll
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes.
Panamera, Ferrari and Royce is the way we roll
Young niggas are in control
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes.
Panamera, Ferrari and Royce is the way we roll
Young niggas are in control
Real niggas will never bend
Yes! We are in control nigga!
Every time I stop, bitches are like what
Everything I have now I have because I stood up
I bought other rolls
I started selling O's, now my bank account is seven O's
And there are two commas in it
And I'm getting blacker, traveling with black Gotti
Behind the Fisker, and I don't mention the black Rarri
Bitches like 'Bari nigga, oh
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes.
As soon as we get to the party, there are options in all these hoes
We're fucking all those bitches, you niggas are getting old
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes.
Panamera, Ferrari and Royce is the way we roll
Young niggas are in control
Real niggas will never bend
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes.
Young niggas are in control
Real niggas will never bend
I'm standing on the couch like shit life
And we just got in a million dollar car
Millions of problems, a thousand weapons, just a couple of dogs
Black man black 40 cal, Tahoe black
Conversations with Meek about the shit we did on the streets.
How we fuck with our dogs, how we plan to eat
Bricked the rapper on the beat, a hundred k in a week
It's CMG, MMG, all the other enemies
Fuck ships and hoes, Cuban links in gold
Since then, the role they chose (screw them!)
Send hittas to their door (murder)
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes.
Panamera, Ferrari and Royce is the way we roll
Young niggas are in control
Real niggas will never bend
Boats and hoes, money, cars and clothes.
Panamera, Ferrari and Royce is the way we roll
Young niggas are in control
Real niggas will never bend
I'm not dead but I'm the president
Green, Dutch money for medicine
Change up to the nose, it's heroin
The city on fire, we let it burn
Smoke made the BM-Dubb move like a hovercraft
Off the road and she trafficking Marilyn Monroe
The front door comes through (let me understand that)
Because most of the time the corners are a gold mine
Out of the hood now we're shooting down the shoreline
Boats and hoes, under cover with them nigga bricks
Ace Diamond
We turn black
Fucking with that other shit
It's new B
I'm a bad motherfucker, how do you like that?
Keep a super bad bitch, how you love that X 2
How do you love that, the mafia is killing
30 deep shakes press the panic button
Dial 911 is an emergency
Hey damn shit on this niggas certainly
Champagne flutes, convertible coupes
She was attracted to the life of the file, she served the troops.
So when she comes I tell her to bring my money too
I love my red rose, my blue devil
My European car, ...
But I'm going to shoot them, hurry up and line them up
I'm a bad motherfucker, how do you like that?
Eryday I'm making myself, how do you love that
Keep a super bad bitch, how you love that X 2
How do you love that, how do you love that
We connect, so don't ask me where the plug is
Niggas hate me, show them love back
But still they try to drive my name through murder
So when the hip line ...
Let's say they kill me, well, where's the blood?
I leave them all wet, like where is the bathtub
Pull me ... like this, like this to come back
All my bad girls bitches, miss cat
It's who ... so you ... to get 6 stacks
How do you love that, how do you love that
I'm a bad motherfucker, how do you like that?
Eryday I'm making myself, how do you love that
Keep a super bad bitch, how you love that X 2
When I think of rappers, I have premonitions
The only thing on my resume is cheating and cooking.
I'm addicted to fast cars, money and bitches
Turn money all kinds of ways, one hundred positions
I used to grind in apartments, ... fuck in the car ...
All this ice on, yeah, my diamond is a conflict
My girl has a girl who they claim to be partners
And Shawty has an uncle that demon ...
I'm married to the game, I don't need to get divorced
How do you love that, how do you love that
I'm a bad motherfucker, how do you like that?
Eryday I'm making myself, how do you love that
Keep a super bad bitch, how you love that X 2
I am receiving money I am receiving money
I will be receiving money, I will be
Are you hating niggas because you're mad or are you mad because you hate?
Dollar after dollar
Getting to the money doesn't even take a shower
Because this is dirty paper
I know you heard me on paper
That flying birdie paper
Make your player dirty
Mortgage on my feet note the car on my belt
Your statements on my wrist, I'm something else
Because she a penny makes an enemy want to kill herself
I am receiving money I am receiving money
Niggas look hungry trying to take it from me
Come to my [?] Shoot like a boss [?]
All the niggas greet my little friend
I go out with Benjamin and he will be killing them
If I get your female bet, she runs through me like cinnamon
I'll be getting money, gangsta and a gentleman
It's like I'm forced to hate them, I dominate them
We give them numbers on the bass as a denominator
Gold prezi that looks like a magnum
The niggas say fuck my bitches but I let them have them
Laughing because I'm not comparing, I'm just sharing
Maserati I will be directing
Riding alongside them hates looking
Wishing it was [?]
Knowing that they want to be me
Every time they see me, I'm on television
The clarity is VVS and I am the freshest
And my jewelry looks fluorescent
And if you see a rapper upset me, it's like you're watching wrestling
Because they are more false than a motherfucker
If you want to reserve your 10,000 plus an elastic band
The real get realer
The lame get weaker
Shizz and Meek Milly baby have to be a Flamer!
Lions and gorillas alright baby, I'm going to tame her
Keep a strap on my whip, that's my hit
My attitude is middle finger
I'm here now, let my scent linger
I can rap and [?] Singer
Are you hating because you are crazy? Are you crazy because you are hating?
I have a couple of years in the air talking about dating
Although hoes fuck with them, brothers
They'll be hating everything on the low low
Do you want [?] Off my pole
So rest in peace A.G., man
Ass so fat I need a lap dance
All gold Trinidad James in my Aston
Walk on this bitch, I shit on shit and then I'm gone
I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on it, I'm on it
Okay, I go into this bitch, I shit on shit, then I go
Michael throw the Birkin bag if you tell me please
She's gonna make that butt clap, blow that up for a real nigga
I'm going to throw that cash, drop it on them real bitches
Murder in that pussy, I can't lie, I kill bitches
Young black man dancing like he was going to the lottery
You only want the money soon, you don't have to lie to me
All these nigga hate me, they know they wanna skin me
Because every time you see Meek Milly, I look like a robbery
It's me ho it's me ho
Walk on this bitch, I shit on shit and then I'm gone
I'm on it, I'm on it
It's me ho it's me ho
Walk on this bitch, I shit on shit and then I'm gone
I'm on it, I'm on it
Uhh, haan
These bitches study my style on the Come Up DVD
Nicki Dibiase, D.D.T
It's a difficult journey, E.V.E
Bad, illegal bitch
It's me, ho; it's me ho
I'm so fucking famous I can't do shit on d-low
I do not believe them; they lie like Leo
Everything these bitches do, I already did
I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on it, I'm on it
It's me ho it's me ho
Walk on this bitch, I shit on shit and then I'm gone
Walk on this bitch, I shit on shit and then I'm gone
Back in my old shit, tell them niggas breathe (breathe!)
They'll brag and take styles, niggas, thieves, ho
Damn, then I get up, I killed that shit, now I grieve, ho
And don't expect any gift tomorrow, this is not Christmas Eve
I tell him that as pens we are going to get rich, you better believe
I make them crocodile bags and the minked pet peeve ho coat
I guess it's just me, ho, Asian girl named Miho
I'm on it, representing where you were born
Where's my joint?
It's me ho it's me ho
Walk on this bitch, I shit on shit and then I'm gone
I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on it, I'm on it
It's me ho it's me ho
Walk on this bitch, I shit on shit and then I'm gone
I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on it, I'm on it
All right, let's be clear
They could have done one or two things
But his track record on the streets is "Ain't Like Me"
They are not me
I have a couple of main hoes that I'm fucking with
But this bad bitch you can't see
And all my niggas go straight to the money, these stones are clear HD
And my DC chain shines bright, shines bright with my golden AP
It's not me, it's not me, these ass niggas is not me
I got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking with
I can't come, a nigga can't be seen
And those bricks still sell them high
My nigga in the fall of the birds ain't cheap
These niggas still sell the job
Tell them the job is not that easy
It's not me, it's not me, these ass niggas is not me
These ass niggas can't come to my neighborhood
Because your pussy, niggas, it's not me
I've got all these shooters down for the cause
And everyone gets money like me
Quarter milli in a white nigga t-shirt
And all the niggas still hate it, still hate it
Talking about what they are going to do to me
But I'm tied up and I'm waiting for it
These niggas ain't built like that
These niggas are killed like this
And they wonder why I feel this way
Because every two months, I make a mill like that
I took my whole family by that hood
Put 'em right on the hills like that, shit that real
You don't like my shit, you paid the flow, I don't write my shit
You better pray to God, I don't like your bitch
Because if she draws attention, then she could be hit! Woah!
It's not me, it's not me, these ass niggas is not me
I have a couple of main hoes that I'm fucking with
But this bad bitch you can't see
And all my niggas go straight to the money, these stones are clear HD
And my DC chain shines bright, shines bright with my golden AP
It's not me, it's not me, these ass niggas is not me
I got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking with
I can't come, a nigga can't be seen
These niggas still sell the job
Tell them the job is not that easy
I'm a real black and I've been like this
The first day and I didn't go to change
In the neighborhood, black acts a little differently when I pass
Because a nigga has a little change
Little black ass pussy, try no nigga
Because if it does, then the flames are gone
That the 40 are gone, bang bang
Those niggas can say my name
My young niggas put on rollies
Your levels to this shit for real
I have the plug in the cover if I want to go back
Put work in the trap of what you know about it
Pillow talking to you, hating a nigga
Damn, lose you like that
He only fucks with real niggas like Meek (How about meek?)
It's not me, it's not me, these ass niggas is not me
I have a couple of main hoes that I'm fucking with
And all my niggas go straight to the money, these stones are clear HD
It's not me, it's not me, these ass niggas is not me
I got a couple real niggas that I'm fucking with
I can't come, a nigga can't be seen
And those bricks still sell them high
My nigga in the fall of the birds ain't cheap
These niggas still sell the job
Tell them the job is not that easy
It's not me, these ass niggas butt it's not me
Making money my days, you know we're repainting DC
Cousin dropped that bag on you, I kill you niggas for free
I have all this money in me, I have all these hundreds in me
Backing up in this Panamera with some rich hoes
Flip them over, circle them like Tic Tac Toe
Hoes Ready, Fucking Fuck
I have a couple of main hoes that I'm fucking with
And all my niggas go straight to the money, these stones are clear HD
And my DC chain shines bright, shines bright with my golden AP
It's not me, it's not me, these ass niggas is not me
I can't come, a nigga can't be seen
And those bricks still sell them high
My nigga in the fall of the birds ain't cheap
These niggas still sell the job
Tell them the job is not that easy
I guess we can't tell you enough
What you do won't make you me
Truthfully, some of you niggas need a little sleep
Your dreams are not manifesting correctly
The boy is back huh, light me Cruz
This year it's all about us, so go to the other side
Well we're already dead from all this murder
In my cell hanging on a rope
Where you have less time to rape than to sell drugs
When you have the same time for the drug, then you do a murder
Innocent to guilty, guilty of the verdict
Because we were going to war with ourselves for that coke
And they were trying to hurt us, lock us so far up in the mountains
No service could be obtained and our families could not assist us
Fighting a silent war with a silencer
How to compete with a Lamborghini with a Challenger
And the feds are going to follow us
And we resort to the media, they lie to us
No one really speaks in the courtrooms that put us up
They tagged us as hooligans, we caught him and we moved him
The children hardly eat at that table with that tuna
Breakfast and lunch Mom ordered the bowl of noodles
Dinner time was on the corner, Lucifer and I
No one
I spoke to the Shmurdas and told them to keep their heads up
And when you land, stay focused and lift your bread
Because when you're getting to that, people are getting fed up
They are building new prisons for us, don't make your bed
Use your head, dog and be careful
Certain niggas just ain't good for you, don't get them closer to you
I'm young, black, and I get money, my loot is serious
America's worst nightmare, what they're afraid of
I'm going home, are you talking about Nicki now?
I spit like a drummer holding 50 bullets
And for my tours it costs 60 pounds
But that hood shit takes my hood off
I'm on the gram like I'm going to the lottery
Buying every car, every house I see, I try to be
A gangsta, he was trying to be a king
You're trying to earn a point, I was trying to get a ring
A couple of niggas were glad they heard I was in the bing
Until they let me out of my cell, I jumped straight into that sink
Balenciaga red interior, are inferior
I did a couple of milli in jail, I'm serious
Monkey asses like George and curious head
I'm talking to Hov on the jail call
You get so many letters that you think it's mail fraud
We have 6 mansions, 12 lofts
3 condos, any apartment? No way
Just all the penthouses, nigga, I've been over it
Come in, come out, like it's a robbery
I went up from the bottom and no one stops me black
I don't know what these niggas stumble over
Don't touch my niggas, I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Don't say my name unless you're suicidal
Don't come close unless you're suicidal
Don't touch my niggas, I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Money won't relieve us
The man niggas even hated Jesus
Live life on the road in search of money
Because hoes won't please us
Now she fucks with a G
I have your bitch who doesn't want to talk
Wait, all the mahfuckers tried to shit us
String all lit up all
Porsche with the horse how to climb
And my bitch put that shit on her
Rock balmain cause i'm dancing
And no more red bottles
Straight Belarie nigga every bottles
Ricky Rozay we are here
Double M G we have been here
Directly from the north side
Right next to the project, how did I get here?
Drinking lean with a bad bitch
From the hills, I probably live there
And get money like me
Wait wait wait wait
I don't know what these niggas are talking about
I don't know what these niggas stumble over
Don't touch my niggas, I suggest you don't
Don't touch my niggas, I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
There is no love on the streets and this blood on my sneakers committed suicide
Going where you don't go
Doing everything you're not doing
Back to the money, my nigga, no, we don't play
Say my name and that's D.O.A
And all these chains say that we are fine
And we drink champagne, we eat Frito Lays
At lunchtime do it once in the ghetto
Because the clock says blowout and the whole band is drums
Me and my nigga, Rozay that's my nigga
D-Boy, that's my batter
None of you can screw us
None of you gossip, Jigga
Give me my throne, and you will not like my photo
Leave a comment, fuck nigga
Wait wait wait wait
Don't touch my niggas, I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Don't come close unless you're suicidal
Don't touch my niggas, I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
You must be suicidal
When we stop, look at the suicide doors
I've been too deep, get them to call 5-0
If you were surprised, I know that gun went away
BLAT, BLAT, BLAT, BLAT
Man i am so
We are going around, we have money
Don't touch my niggas
I suggest you not
I don't know what these niggas are talking about
I don't know what these niggas stumble over
Don't touch my niggas, I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Don't say my name unless you're suicidal
Don't come close unless you're suicidal
Don't touch my niggas, I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
When I leave Lear, the diamonds in me are so clear
Tell me hoes that I share, you couldn't get close
I say, nigga pussy, I dare, you try to reach and reach the air
You fuck and they check you, the doctor pumps your chest as clear
Yeah my niggas ball all year round, all of you niggas so square (lame)
And all my niggas live, why the hell would I care?
When that Lambo flows, you all suck your eyes
And all the haters are going to hate, shit, because all the hoes are going to cheer
Cause I'm counting green in my money machine, that bitch sounds like she's writing
Hustle hard on that day, but have fun on that night life
My chain lit up with black stones, but they shine strong like your white ice
Because your shit is false and your shit late, there is no birthday but I get cake
Nigga smoking that Cali Kush, that strong shit without lifting weights
I tell the niggas don't look at me while time goes by on that big face
Young nigga get it, young nigga get it
Neck full of that gold, Rollie gold go with him
Gold H on my belt, phone full of gold diggers
Drinking gold bottles of Spade, tell them hoes to imagine
Neck full of that gold, Rollie gold go with him
Drinking gold bottles of Spade, tell them hoes to imagine
Wake me up and I'm snoring, choking on a whole gang of chains
And we are submerging, she parking, I guess she gets used to things
When diamonds fall out of my mouth I guess that bitch went crazy
Crazy about it, her best friend is riding shotty
I shot her down in her 'Rari, then I left in Ducatti
Damn Tony, melons, fuck for getting Mary
She said her ex was Larry, but fuck that black Larry
Fucking with that white milk, I could call it dairy
Sit behind while we stop, we could blind ourselves with the canaries.
Neck full of that gold, Rollie gold go with him
Gold H on my belt, phone full of gold diggers
Drinking gold bottles of Spade, tell them hoes to imagine
Young nigga get it, young nigga get it
Neck full of that gold, Rollie gold go with him
Gold H on my belt, phone full of gold diggers
I'd rather eat crumbs with bums before splitting my steak with you snake niggas
I'd rather keep my days before I find you fake niggas
I'd rather have a real bitch screwed up than deal with all those fake bitches
And I'm not with the flood in the gram I don't really fuck with you, don't take a picture of me nigga
Posted in the corner with a 40 on my hip, Godzilla
We were hitting it when they hit my nigga Dean, that's when the shit got more real
I was on the south side, really outside I had weapons, assassins
He started from the bottom of the bottom now his bottles appeared in the sky villa
Catch a body, I know about it
I'm where you couldn't talk, it's not about that
I'm not really talking let's be G about it
And these niggas talk like they know me
Finna turns me into the old me
I should have listened to my mom when she said
Now these bitches throw pussy because they owe me
I got the juice, nigga, I got the juice
Nigga, I got the juice when I got out of the coupe
When I get out of the coupe
Real niggas, I'm a greeting
Because I have the juice, I have the juice
Counting millions of dollars, let's screw something
Put an eight in my Phantom I don't want any
Looking black, I'm not getting anything
My black Ernie is thirty years old trying to sink something
I call Arizona and the truck is coming
Take a bird to the table, we don't face anything
I'm a nigga from the north at the end of the day
Gun butt a nigga with the end of the K
Don't come here like your niggas are safe
Damn if you're with them
It's money and murder if you fuck with my niggas
I fucked up all those bitches because
Nigga, I got the juice when I got out of the coupe
When I get out of the coupe
Because I have the juice, I have the juice
Nigga, I got the juice, she popping her pussy
As if it was Uncle Luke
Because I have the juice
All he ever wanted was a black trap
Every time you saw me, I was tied black
Get dull on your back nigga
No, this is not a 550, this is a Bach, nigga
Nigga prolly spend your car money on that act nigga
Couple bands, 5 black frames
You call it beefin 'when' @ 'niggas
We call it beefin 'when we clap niggas
I got the juice, nigga, I got the juice
Nigga, I got the juice when I got out of the coupe
Real niggas, I'm a greeting
Because I have the juice, I have the juice
Nigga I got the juice
Charge the helicopter screaming R.I.P. Snupe
Go blame me, we won't blame you
We are not going to blame that, we are not going to target you
I put the phone on silent, everything vibrated the sheets. When they took me to jail, I thought you were waiting for me
Mess with the same old lame people who hated me all. All that shit that you told all those lies that you told
All that shit you made, those false dreams you sold. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand why I'm so cold
I got an ice box on my chest, girl, my heart froze
The lyrics of this song have not yet been released. Check back once the song has been released.
I was fucked up, but bitch, I'm back
I wasn't in the club because I was in the trap
I tell them how you like me now?
Cause I'm shining like a diamond, I got money in my pocket
I don't even have to press, I see it, I like it, I copy it, oh!
I see it, I like it, I copy it, oh!
I see it, I like it, I copy it, black, what's the subject?
It started from the bottom, now I really have it exploding
The same hoes that answered, they want it, now I have it
Because I'm playing, I'm talking Spaldin
Rollie on my wrist, flooded like New Orleans
A nigga buzzing now, I'm talking hornets
Because I kill all my enemies, I stretch my opponents
Zombies in my neighborhood, shit is like Thriller
And I'm Mike Jackson because I'm your dealer
In my jacket with zipper and my collar in chiller
Going hard is scary, I swear it's scary
I put a mirror tint on this ghost and screaming 'Bloody Mary
So when you see me Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary
A nigga plays with me, he's fucking buried
Coming around town in Philly with Meek
Do a hunnit every week, so now I'm doing a trick like a sheik
And we do this shit for PA, we do this shit for PA
How I used to mess it up, now my money comes the clean way
Blindfolded, making 100 down the highway
Bitch, I got out of that circus shit, young man but I'm learning fast
Kill this, burn your kids, then call child services
And they don't even have to ask, they know that Mac is working
Act safe, smoke a fucking beat like I'm a Nat Sherman
Go give me a rapper
I'm going to chew his ass like it's an animal biscuit
He spits out venom straight, gives bars like it's a state prison
Yeah i'm still scruffy getting money
I have all these writers crazy because their daughters want to fuck me
Court! Court!
Music M-M-Maybach

You cross the line, I make you murder for a cost (Murder)
Out in Las Vegas (Out in Las Vegas), I took a loss (I took a loss)

Music M-M-Maybach
Remix!
(One two, one two)
This is the remix of I'm a Boss
Meek Milly
I'm riding or I die as I go holla Westside right inside me
Bimmer 760i, try me sixty shots
Again we have the city hot and exploding as it was supposed to be.
Hoes that are not working need not be near me
So cold, a fierce G, niggas ain't as dumb as me
Take care of your shit affairs, take care of your mouth when you approach me
Fuck with hoes they fuck with hoes, make pills and powders socially
I like them, although I don't love them, emotionally cold heart
Captain where the ocean is, riding again on the Ghost
It gives you a lot of saliva until you swallow it all
Call the shots, run the shit, on a big money shit
You all speak dawg, it fails and I have none of that
I'm the big dawg boss, I floss all day and run it
Bitch I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We are in this bitch, it's going down
You just buy that motherfucker and throw that shit at him
You will be popping the labels, we just throw them in bags
And then we get to the damn block, we throw rags at them
It started with a dollar, turn it into an M
You should see how people treat you when that money comes
Bad bitches calling cause I'm playing
And I'm parking Aston Martins where they walk, these niggas don't matter
Informants really talk when people honk
I'm really a boss, Nino or Al Pacino
One hundred racks in this Rollie, it lights up like a casino
Niggas really be a fraud, I'll keep it like a C note
Everyone prays for me, I respect that
I woke up in the hospital where my checks in
Then I put eight chains where my neck is
Jumping in the ghost, I feel like I'm dead
It's worth 40 M's so respect that
I put all my jewelry on just to bone your girl
You know the boss well known for leaving bonuses
We are making money
When the job is clean, cut it like a carrot cake
D-boys love the way I narrate
I still spank him like I'm Anna Mae
Remember mom had a gentleman
Better check the statistics, we fill sands
And I have the gats, Gilbert Arenas
Bitch I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
We are in this bitch, it's going down
Yeah I'm the king where's my fucking crown
You are a boss, you are a boss
Seven five, seven showers on it
Spend about thirteen hours
7-57 with showers
We spent about thirteen hours
See I'm probably on my skateboard trying to learn a new trick
I just fucked an Avatar, now I have a blue cock
Money talks, shit goes if the shoe fits well
You push daisies, daffodils, tulips
I point the gun at you like a camera phone
I am Young Money, Cash Money, I am not human
I'm trying to get money, money like Mark Cuban
If she doesn't respect me, she will respect this cock
The world is an asshole and we are the next big shit
Damn, I gangbang, tell them the blood is slime
Shit! I had to say fuck once, get it
When I appeared in this bitch, it shone every summer
Took the whole thing, the young black man doing numbers
Sweets on the avenue, sweets on the slab
One Hundred Gig Nigga, Cash Millionaires
A hundred thousand blacks, how we turn it
Blood rich gang, you know we're dirty niggas
Moving everywhere, new fleets with my round
Touch another city, put it all down
Pop a hundred bitch bottles, we wear the crown
Bitch I'm a boss
Bitch, I'm a boss! Bitch, I'm a boss!
I play the shots, I call the calls
We are in this bitch, it's going down
Yeah I'm the king where's my fucking crown
Started poor with plans to own more
Now we have stores and we fuck the baddest whores
I was on tour with niggas that sold raw
I started selling white, we won't sell it anymore
I'm like, Trump doesn't feel us, the cops are still killing us
Niggas taking pictures, they can't stop me, they're not real enough
New dawn, Hermes seat, I let the ceiling rise
Just to gently kill them, ooh, get them off me
Try to crucify me like I'm Jesus as she crosses me
I'm too bossy and thorough
To move like a weirdo, on point like an arrow
Diamonds like water and jump from the gym
Shooting like Harden if your head was the edge
Cause niggas wanna line me up like a shape and a cut, damn
When I was broke, they were great
Even if I don't, they're like "You did it!"
That's why I never went to school nigga
And why do I rap like I have something to try black?
I went and bought the mansion with the pool.
No weapon is formed against me every time I pray at night
Scootin 'thotties in Phantom, that's the way of life
And make them fuck their best friends like dykes
I'm with the herd, uh, coming back, yeah
Spending dope, nigga, selling slap, gang
I'm getting music chips like Rap Snacks
Yes, 10 thousand in Ethika cash, that's a fact
I know these niggas are mad, they still don't see me fall
They want to see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm in shit they haven't seen before
Dreaming chasing, catching all my goals
I don't need these whores
I'm getting money, me and all my problems
Play with me, you know it's a total war
Young niggas do our best
Bloggers in a frenzy, truck to the Bentley
I'm not doing interviews, I'm busy, nigga, we're little
So when you see me, don't ask me about Nicki
Damn, I look like counting my business on Wendy
Gossip niggas like queens, we were serving demons
.40 pull out the windows: Jazmine Sullivan
They told Pop Mollys, I told them to be kings
Drinking 1942 like I'm thin
I've seen all these niggas try to minimize my dreams
Some assholes want to be me and some assholes want to leave me
I know, I check it, I don't show it
I said to the blacks who wrote it, I won't get back what I quoted
It started with a quarter, I turned it in half
I made it an ounce, got some shit in the stash
Nigga says he's going to steal from me, he put a brick in his ass
And one thing about Meek Milly, I'm going to get to a bag
I had to starve all day just to get there fast
Like Ramadan, totin 'K is like Palestine
Since I met Ross and signed the dotted line
I gave my mom 10,000 at least a thousand times
Do the math!
They want to see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm in shit they haven't seen before
Dreaming chasing, catching all my goals
Play with me, you know it's a total war
Speaking, this is my arrogant flow
Damn Daniel, why are you his son? Although Mister Miyagi
This that Patek rose gold, call me like '94
It doesn't mean anything to me, I tell you how it should go
Rain, sleet, in that corner when the block was slow
Everyone was trying to catch, we started to explode
I heard that bitch say that she cut me, I was like "bye!"
In the field, throw them, they look like dominoes
When you get a dollar, they hate
I bought my mother the crib with that door
They want to see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm in shit they haven't seen before
Dreaming chasing, catching all my goals
I don't need these whores
I'm getting money, me and all my problems
Play with me, you know it's a total war
Young niggas do our best
Yes, yes, baby, are you drunk? Have you had enough
I got the club going crazy
All these bitches, but my eyes on you
Are you someone's baby?
If you are not, girl, what are we going to do?
If your ego needs it, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh)

We were counting this money, loving the feeling (ooh, oh, ooh)
Look at you now, in love with a hitta (yes, yes, yes)
But now everything is in me, and everything is in me (yes, yes)
To say something to your cute butt

Could be your plug for that (yeah)
You could fall in love with it, have love for it (yes, yes, yes)
What's your name? With whom?
Where are you from? You the shit
Pick and choose, get the right one
All these girls, I liked them (yes, yes, yes, yes)

What are you going to do? Hide or run? Woah
Are you ready?
Baby, are you drunk? Have you had enough
I got the club going crazy
All these bitches, but my eyes on you
Are you someone's baby?
If you are not, girl, what are we going to do? (Oh)
Leave everything for you right now
We got the club going crazy
I, he was the most real, I was the baddest, we were the most delusional
When he approached me, I said, "What's the deal?"
Now everything is in us, and all this depends on trust
And if those bitches want to travel, tell them they are leading us.
This lonely kitty, he bends down, bends them down
He was like (What's your name?) My name Nick
(Where are you from?) New York in this bitch
(Choose and choose) You have the right one
All of them hoes, there's nothing like them
Nigga, you know you'll never handcuff them
What are they going to do? Meek and Nick
Are you here looking for love? Ooh ooh
I got the club going crazy
All these hittas, but my eyes on you
Are you someone's baby? (Ah, ooh, ooh)
If your ego needs it, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh)
All eyes, all eyes on you
She was the baddest, he was the most real (ooh, ooh)
We were the most flying, we were the most illustrious
(Yes Yes Yes)
We were the most flying, in the building (oh, ooh)
(Yes Yes Yes)
Question
What do an old head and a young bull have in common?
Know the answer, someone is likely to make fun
Real niggas stand up Philly Flamers
Standing niggas caught their cases they took the time
I know niggas who were ratified OGs on their own team
It took all his clique time to sit down
The same niggas who act hard call them a bitch now
Real niggas standing
And if you did, then there are consequences, nigga man up
I remember them hungry day cutting them grams
I stack a couple of hundred just to save a big
From one hundred dollars to one hundred thousand
Get a couple of bricks to flood the hood like public housing
I was in the stands just looking like I was exploring
Taking out all the players, playing Dion Waiters
Niggas in my ward are fools beyond the haters
Acts hard but melts faster than Now & Laters
I only take one point, grab my nine later
Rules for the game laugh now and cry later
Fast cars, fast bitches
Live life fast, you better fall fast, nigga
And fuck first place while I'm not the last nigger
And I'm on the run, I'm too hungry for a nigga to taste
You try to reach them and catch them in your face
It is not my birthday, I am receiving cake
Writing [?] The feds raised it in VA
And free my nigga Lil 'they took him up to the north of the state of Pennsylvania
The state brought my nigga Rick to life [?]
I was five years old, I saw them close my dad's coffin
And ever since then I've been squeezing the ratchet tight
It was '05 Birds on the Move Boston Market
Corner boss chilling in my corner office
Everything was fine, the paper flowed like the Nile River
In winter he shook the mink and in summer he dropped the top on them
Every two different days see them
They my niggas switched sides with me
They said they would ride me
He shot me in front of my son, he was only five years old.
Should have caused a nigga to go crazy
Kingpins run the game nigga never been afraid
Gunshot wounds keep bleeding niggas hit them niggas again
Selling rocks is how we live in this habitat
I never ratified a real deal, I was never an impostor
Cops who sound like Biggie Smalls asking who shot you
Don't worry about that, pig, I'll take care of mine
Call [?] Hit the niggas like he's alone
One minute you're a king who cools off with a mink
Most of the blacks here are going to die before their grandfather.
Niggas did [?] Like Rottweiler
There is no gas in your crib, so you cannot take a hot shower
Grab her 30 gauge [?] Take a hot black shower
Because they can't afford a hamburger or a fucking Caesar salad
This is real
I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more
Yeah niggas are watching me stunted, I know I'm getting all these bucks
I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more
Nigga still get these hundreds, I know I got all of these (everything I want, everything I need)
Damn, look what you started
We have turned my crib into a after party
And everything I really want to do, everything I really want to do, hey
It's putting my hands on your body, just rolling with you
All I want is you, all I want is you
All a black wants is you
The liquor has me stupid
Now, honey, tell me what you want to do, hey (everything I want, everything I need)
Wait wait
Wait wait wait wait
A little hood with a booty like the left eye
Wait wait wait wait
Pussy so good, I want to put on a rap line
Plus 5, plus 5, she was so good, she sleeps like a nap (woo! Oh Lord)
She woke up like that with her butt all over me from behind
She wants to do the surfboard, just try to be like Beyoncé (surfboard)
And if she always does it so well then she could be my fiancee (his wife)
I want more, I want more and now damn, I want yours
Thinking about how we got to the floor?
From sofa to bed when we walk in the door
And I left the door like
Damn, look what you started
We have turned my crib into a after party
And everything I really want to do, everything I really want to do, hey
All I want is you, all I want is you
All a black wants is you
The liquor has me stupid
Now, honey, tell me what you want to do, hey (everything I want, everything I need)
Oh oh oh oh yes
Damn, look what you started
We have turned my crib into a after party
And everything I really want to do, everything I really want to do, hey
It's putting my hands on your body, just rolling with you
All a black wants is you
The liquor has me stupid
Oh oh oh oh yes
I know fake niggas ain't real (hah, they're not real)
This is why we take their girls and make money, we make money (we get money)
A double cup and a whole bag of pills (why?)
I hear them on the pole and they shake something, shake something (come on)
Damn, look what you started
We have turned my crib into a after party
It's putting my hands on your body, just rolling with you
All a black wants is you
The liquor has me stupid
Now, honey, tell me what you want to do, hey (everything I want, everything I need)
Get you in traffic, it's me and you
Gold 41 in suit and tie, black, do it or die
Have I seen it now, if I lose everything like who would ride?
But nigga, I'm so awake, if I stumbled it's like suicide
I was on the block when you were a shoe
Nigga ain't Nike, ain't Yeezy, not Jordan V
I came back like Mike using 45
Have you ever seen $ 50,000 when everything is at 5?
Only the rapper turned gold without a Hov verse
I still have the rock with me, cooking on the stove
And the Rollie all platinum, I know I looked it up in Joe
Maybach in the hood, so the fools can know
About to go and grab the Benz truck, see you later
This is massacre, a new world order
I'm going hard, Westbrook, fourth quarter
I don't know how they go down the border
I give them the dirty flow, Michigan and water
I sent them 10 thousand cases, I put in my order
Call the poppin 'bottles when my people can't afford it
Mix D'usse with lemonade when I'm in Georgia
Views of the projects, and black am the perspective
Speaking loudly, say I'm shooting with metal objects
And that girl standing right next to you, I blew it up
He made me hit a fan, I feel like I'm Artest, woo!
Golden billboard microphone, to plug it in
Tell Cruz to put it in the booth so he can screw it up
I have the hood super lit, jumping like I'm a dutch double
You niggas all the way fucked up
You changed sides, now you stayed (stay there my g)
This is
They don't want to see you on top
I just want to see the streets above
That's
They will take pictures when you are up
I guess they have to point at you
But don't let these nobody give you their name
If she's for everyone, don't let her claim you
Now listen, you gave up, I came for you
I took my talents somewhere else, LeBron James supported you
I was Kyrie with rock, crack game number 2
Now I'm older, I'm still dancing like my name Uncle Drew
They tell you ... stay the same, but they change with you
Niggas change the crew as the hoes change their boo
I just played the cards dealt to me until a change was made
I guess I had to change the dealer or just change the shoe
Now blackjack, Ace of Spade and a shot from Jack
I met a bad actress, she doesn't know how to act
I took her but I brought her back
I don't want her back, I bought her bag
I killed like Hasselbeck, I call my car quarterback
If I threw it at you, would you doubt that I can catch it?
It's not about shooting submarines, it's about scratches
But if the shoe fits you, black, buy an outfit that matches
And you know my boys hold it, we'll go out with the ratchets
I heard your boys told him you were with the rats
Keep that in "Shhhh!”, Nothing less, nothing more
What about your warriors? They don't look hard anymore
You should express your feelings, brother, and get in your bag, boy
Level up, level up, it's about leveling up
Hold that damn bezel and light up this bitch all the way
All the way up
All the way up
And every time you see me black
Man I'm all the way
This is
Edsclusive
Uhh, haa
Days I thought why not ha ha
Meek called me and Fab, Joe called Jigga
She jumped on 6, 550 was not big enough
They can step on the water, but they can't swim enough
No, I am made for the physical excursion.
Besides that, I'm dirty, like municipal housing
I'm in all the places on the hood that you didn't let in
Opps in the building, automatically alerts that
Hand on the wrist so that the chrome does not recoil
Take it out, you know you have to spray that
You need the lobby key to slide up
Born with him, so you don't have to register
I have to go when you have to go, your time is up
Spread out, no need to keep all 9 hidden
I'm pulling you off the ladder for trying to climb
Yes, with a view of the city.
There are 50 in the bank, who is filming? Shoot at 50
If so, then these niggas think they hit me
But I am-
All the way up
Haa
I'm all the way up
All the way up
All the way up
And every time you see me black
Man I'm all the way
I even bought you diamonds, I put you in that double C
The way you love the game, you couldn't be in love with me
I work too hard for my name to let a bitch put mud on me
So how can I trust you? (Trust you)
When all the rich niggas fuck you (they fuck you)
Make you my baby, I'd love to
You were a penny, but I doubled you (doubled you)
The first time I bagged that shit I got excited
Swimming in that pussy, girl, I swear there's nothing like it
I have plans to cut you, I know you won't like it
I won't forget you, you're a bad bitch (bad bitch)
I prepared you so you can level up (level up)
But you were used to being average (average)
Jumping on jets, you got caught up in life
They spent you on Instagram, caught you in the hype
A ho gon 'be a ho, so no use without advice
When you crossed me, you lost me, I can't let you cross twice
I almost fell in love with a thottie (Oh)
My father said "You have too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)
I have to pour out my feelings that are inside of me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon 'come to the light (Come to the light)
Magic from the start, you were fucking me good (fucking me good)
Treat me like a king, baby, talk to me good (talk to me)
You're fucking with a ball player and now you're acting
I saw you in traffic, you act like you've never met me
I only laughed when I saw that fool with you (Ha)
I almost fell in love with a ho
I still dream of fucking slow
So fat ass everything from behind
It's very wet, slippery, dropped me
And the way you treated me, almost everything came in (all inside)
Because relationships become situations
I know you don't wanna hear this gamer shit, but baby I'm made for this
You made your bed, you have to lie on it
My heart can't play with this (No)
I have to save myself before I try to save a bitch (Woah)
I haven't been handcuffing without hoes and I won't start
I had to kick my wrist, protect my heart (protect my heart)
I had to kick my wrist, protect my heart
My father said "You have too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)

Treat me like a king, baby, talk to me good (talk to me)
Ugh, I have to keep a vest in my heart (in my heart)
You are the reason that good women have it difficult (they have it difficult)
Shit, we were good until our feelings got involved
That's when I did my homework and then I really got involved, oh
Oh and I don't know how I'm going to do it
Now a cold-hearted nigga, baby, nobody
I discovered you all nonsense
And you have many bodies, nobody
No, you let what we had die young (die young)
And that's the word for Lil Roddy (Lil, no, no)
As soon as I thought I had one, I thought
I almost fell in love with a thottie (Oh)
My father said "You have too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)
I have to pour out my feelings that are inside of me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon 'come to the light (Come to the light)
Magic from the start, you were fucking me good (fucking me good)
Treat me like a king, baby, talk to me good (talk to me)
My ambition as a rider
Yes, it is my ambition as a rider.
Hey it's my ambition as a rider
Loccin ', carrying toasters, fuck you weren't there
Holding, never folding, we were on the top level
Chained to our ankles it was like a nightmare
Have you ever washed your drawers with the same water that you shit?
Doing push-ups on the floor where you pee?
You gotta rumble from night to morning and shit
Holding on to that gun, God made me rebellious
Fuck them niggas, I teach you a lesson
Trigger fingers, meet Smith and Wesson
Throw the money away, let it burn on them
My ambition as a rider
Oh yes my ambition as a rider
Oh yes my ambition as a rider
Money is the root of evil, wait until the shooters see you
Lurking in Grand Marquises, escorting you, your people
I made a movie with niggas, murder and you the sequel
The bullets will guess you, they will use tubes to feed you
Mom is going to disconnect
Big head like Hey Arnold's, full of blood
Smell death in the air when we stop
Bullets go B-B-BRRRR, fill them
I regret when I murder the opposites
Pick and roll, stop and choose
I charge, I turn the corner, I drop the shit
And we leave no evidence for residents to grieve
And keep your eyes open until you start to gasp
My ambition as a rider
Oh yes my ambition as a rider
Oh yes my ambition as a rider
Oh yes it's my ambition as a pilot
I just want to thank God
For all the pretty women he left in my life
All the Benjamins let me count
Wealth and health
And letting me play with these niggas

Bottle after bottle, drink until overdose
Stop at the Ghost, watch the bitches catch the Holy Ghost
Errtime, I go up to the dealership, I'm going bankrupt
Shorty wants to fuck me, I mean climb to the top and Roller Coast
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Also, I am on probation, when I am tested only I urinate Rosé
Because last night, I was tough, Peach Ciroc, Patron and everyone
Thirty racks in magnum bottles, I think I was born to dance
It looks like a million more, fresh out of that corner store

For the niggas jumping the fence, I hope the niggas can float
And I just hope they forgive me for worrying about how they live
And lend a little money and keep them out of prison
I'm not lying in my verses, I'm just telling you the basics
Of growing up with your friends and becoming the one who did it
Yes sir! All gold man I got the soul of these bitches
Caring about your followers, you need to increase your dollars
Me and Meek, young niggas popping like our necklaces
And the good is not good enough, and your hood is not enough
I spent all my life putting, you spent all your life putting

Package, had racks on racks
I'm a crippled nigga, I gotta put my set on the map
Hold a double cup, I have to throw four legs
Water on me, I could pull a jetski
A real black behind bars, they had to let me out
Now five bad bitches want me to drop sex
Hunnids bitches [??], then we chill
Richard Millie stole my wrist
60 and 100 racks, I did that
Roddy Ricch, all I know is to break rubber bands
I remember sitting on the projects
With a dollar bill, then I turned it into a hunnid gang
It's not my fault if your main bitch chooses
Straight from Compton, I'm a rich nigga, I'm ruthless
Jumped at dawn, I forget where the roof is
Nine Millie, I'm a bitch, I shoot, I relax
This is a big body, you can hardly park it
I see nothing, I'm afraid, run and tell them
I don't break in the air I hear the police coming
Hell, if I care, I'm going to throw a couple in your hair
Let's break the bullets
The doctors tried to repair
Brain shards now you in that wheelchair
That's 600 a shoe but it's free for you to stare at
Diamonds dazzle that boy who spent a hundred, that's the player rate
What I left in jewelry is the salary the mayor earns
Show me how to bake a cake
Take it to the plate, cut it
Move it to the block, take it out
I'm not with that, says hommie
And you know how we play hommie
Big Ice just me diamond cuts I love it's the DJ hommie

And got another one on the k
If you must listen, better come, give me, give me
Trust that when we launch you know this
Goon on the side keeps him focused
Focused on the club we smoke
Smoking better not provoke us
I could have it on the block, all sore
Stop playing with all those games
Leaves shawty wet life rain falling
I better know that when I press that thing, I'm accurate, you can trust this goal
I still have it in the changing block
B thought that he, he, he, you guys are not the same
A millionaire in my bag that was just my first outfit
Jump off the block, straight to the jet
So tell me what the hell is wrong
I'm not mistaken at all
After all the time I put on I deserve to dance
We are not wrong at all
I got to the top and I don't fall
We are not wrong at all
Am I wrong because I want to play?
Am I wrong to leave fifty in this Audemar
'Cause I remember moments tossing dime through that corner store
Risking my freedom, abandoning people
I'm in those roles, the system wants me to give you a reason
So they can break my dreams, now I'm a king
I'm riding Phantom Ghost, you know my passenger means
I'm with a bad bitch dating because she's never had shit
Take it out of the projects and put it in this Aston
Stunted growth and ball formation, ball formation and flexing, and then cashing
But what these niggas talk about is just word of mouth
Thirty thousand dollars I send the killer man just to blow them up
They call me lil 'fish' because I'm swimming in that pussy
Jahlil beats, holla to me!

Get up, Lamborghini, make them eat the dust, oh lord
Ah, V.I.P. for all P.Y.T.s
Bloated in the session, we are doing B.I.G.s
I'm only known for having fun with these Givenchys
He said he wanted some of Molly, needed to see her ID.
Get her smoking cookies, now she Chinese
When I ask him if he leaves, that means he has to go
Like we're taking a picture, baby we got cheese
The first five minutes came, damn, she was not happy
I'm like, "Wait, Uber on the way now, uh
With a rich black, pipe, huh
See again? Baby not now
12:45, I'm on my way to the club (we turned on)

Bust down, and ice cream

Make her puff a line like a pin (snh)
Take it all off, take it all off with your friends, ay
Play with my dogs, then we go with your head, yeah
The Percocets on me, a young black man takes a lot of medicine
I'm tall like the law, I'm lit up like July 4th
The double R seats are tight, but a really smooth (soft) pussy black
I'm going to take off on sight (take off), run over a nigga like Moss
I got myself a Draco on the flight, I left the creek like Dawson
Hello, 200 miles on the dash (skrt-skrt-skrt)

Fuck a fuckboy bitch on purpose
Destroy a brick, put it in a bag and serve it
Let's take this shit as far as possible
Play with me and the shit is killed (brrp-brrp)
With your back to that Bach and I'm tied with that clapper on me
32 and the black running
These niggas pussy and in their feelings like February
Back to back
I let Nicki know they were mad about it
When I'm riding, it pumps these niggas like an asthma attack
Because when we run into them there is no pass for that
I don't want to hear niggas talk about nicki again
...cracking
We were in the clubs, we received these supports
And I was like damn how you got over it ...
You bring out feelings in me that I never show
No one has made me feel like this before
I'm a good girl, but I want to be bad for you
I want to be bad for you
I want to be bad ad-ad
I want to be bad
And they say that bad girls are not good
Good girls are not fun
I still can't find a nigga that touches that
And I'm not looking for it
Never trust but I'm working on it
Pool, you surf in it
They still think you're a church girl
We connect on your days off
And I still give you that work girl
Like work, twerk
Do it like that video
Great with that, I get it
First year we both face each other
We had feelings that we didn't show
Second year we couldn't hide it
Funny part they didn't know
How could something so bad feel so good?
But to whom to say this wrong? This is your Life
Word
You bring out feelings in me that I never show
I'm a good girl, but I want to be bad for you
I want to be bad for you
I want to be bad ad-ad
I want to be bad
We are fucking the city, going hard every night
Because I broke many hearts, I don't do girls well
But you also broke hearts, but that boy doesn't fight
Just look at my eyes and see what's inside
You know it's pride, you say I'm worth it
But I said I'm not ready, I'm really ready
I'm really ready, I'm ready like never before
I only give you a key to my heart
You will be the first to enter the door
I used to hear you flirt with them guys
They would never score
Everything you heard about me and women
I don't trust them before
You know what we're on
And I got the microphone, so let me act, sing it
No one has made me feel like this before
I'm a good girl, but I want to be bad for you
I want to be bad for you
I want to be bad ad-ad
I want to be bad for you
I can hear it in your voice, you never been in this shit nigga
We're still at war
Selling drugs, doing wheelies
When the feds came, they picked up all of southern philadelphia
When the feds came, they picked up all of southern philadelphia
We were grinding, they hated
Perfect time to get this money, I was patient
Just one to keep it real, when they pretended
I'm not a black around me, I don't give a hundred bands to
They never fall, on the bitches we run through
When you get the money, like I have it, they can't stand you
Fuck it, we're at war with the system, on the streets
Bulletproof, I'm in the trenches, niggas said they gave me beef
And my friend lined up my other friend, because he is disgusting
Don't show love for that black ass pussy, it gets deep
For the love of that Benji, we spill blood in his streets
And I know why they hate me, there's no love in their streets
He was hinting at work, we thought it was love, it was cheap.
He was selling us that reerock, pumping us into that Reebok
She glided over him with three Glocks, dirtied him for three blocks
Turn that boy into frozen pop, shoot 'em until he unlocks
Young niggas killing, all the old heads pull back
And the sound of those 30s begins to sound inspiring
Please don't judge us, they killed our brothers
We've starved all winter, they'll feel our summers
I went at first sunrise over them, we make numbers
And when we have a chance to rain on them, we will flood them
Fuck it, fuck it
I told them I'm going to pray for them
Catch a body, take it to the grave for me
And if they surprise you, you will never change me, no
Talk about bags, put a bag on it, let that money speak
Dad was arrested, so it's Dad's fault
You killed the niggas of you, do you tell them that part?
Why are you taking it so far?
We are the type to call the opps and have a showdown
Make a fool call your friend, that's a man
They were so used to fake shit, they don't know what was real
All my enemies, friends, I don't know who to kill.
I don't know who is going to be silent and who is going to scream
I don't know who thurl was
Because everything got blurry and it came down to that money
I saw niggas eating from me, made me look while I'm hungry
Bitches traded for fame, you gotta see them fake
I don't know where I'm going, I need navigation
They came and got some young black men for their graduation
I spent a time when Patek still has no patience
I gave my nigga 20 years, put him on vacation
Stars on the roof, it feels like a spaceship
They just killed my little cousin, I wish I could have saved him
'Member runs out of time in Las Vegas when we made it important
Niggas turned their back on us, I feel like they played us
I have to see these niggas shut down because they've been trapping fumes
We have hard ball money
Get hard money
While traveling around town on my S550
Quiet and cold because I dance to Audemar like 20
And the diamonds on my neck dancing on her go silly
Come with me, this Philadelphia in her finesse, I am your highness
I am a plus but you are a less
Because my mind is on the money and there is money on my mind
And I'll be in the mix like water
Not at all, could you find it?
Hitting the club needs no ID
I lil 'Dolla T.I.P
Yeah so bring the baddest bitches
I just pack them up and then hit them
Check and add them to my list
And I don't love them, I don't husband them
Fuck it, pass it to my nigga
And Prada's most recent kicks [?]
We have money, hardball
Big business, all big
So when they hate to hate, tell them to hate a little more
We're fooling around with them showing up in that Ace and more
Fly Guy grabs a ho to a wing
With a black in the [?]
By any means necessary
Legendary dick game
Fifteen years, the gun never scares
The next time you see it it will be in the obituary.
If I got a CT scan, see dollar signs nigga
Money on my mind, Bently continental
You all niggas reach the Chevy look like mustard
Inside the mayonnaise get lettuce I'm a scammer
Flow 187 could you call me young murder
Beat the track like Tina Turner's name
I have counters for counters
I have lawyers for lawyers
Fucking thick yellow bitches somewhere in foreign land
I said I come to the scene so fresh, so clean
That 7 4 pounds with the window down
Like 50 on my neck, I feel like the king without a crown
I will be Pradad until death and all my team will be low
Red horse, red stripe, red Porshe, red lights
Tell me to stop because i'm killing them
I have change like a chameleon
And they limp, they don't feel them, but they tell them to keep hating
Praying in my fall, tell them to keep waiting
I'm here i'm there
With the rocks don't ride anywhere
I'm so flying when I'm going to read
Why would I lie? No, I do not care
I ride those five without fear
Keep that helicopter on deck
If a nigga runs to me, hit him without rap
We have money and a hard ball
We drop that job in the pot, hard whip
And we take it to the block, we bring it back and it's all ours
She's the bitch of the dream team
Mr philadelphia
Jalil Beats, holla to me
All I ever wanted was a million and a bad bitch
I was 17 years old I left my crib, I went to where the cash went
And it appeared again in my hood at an Aston mansion
Flying with the hood up, and they're filling me up
I'm over my chicken bitch and I spit out that hot sauce
Breitling mustard yellow, tell them to catch up, I'm a hot dog
Shot bar, fuck no, take me where the bottles are
Mr. Rose baby, get a lot of it
Copy that, Roger that, I'll be where it's appearing
Jahlil hit that beat I b-b-body that
I'm going to take the shore, baby, cause it costs more
Shawty tried to jump into the coupe, can't find the car door
Why do you think I work so hard and die so hard for
Hey, bottles up, Shawty let me drop
Ask who's fucking with me, not a sound
I hear them talking hating, but they whisper
We are dancing, we are playing
Ballin 'like it's Spalding
Every time I wake up, all I hear is money calling
Ballin and ballin, tearing apart the Martin
Call me sir demolition ball the way I break the walls
Shizzy is not a drug
Used to have grass, now they say the bottom has drugs
I knew a nigga had soap, and they rocked his ass
They saw that they made a round blow, and they stopped his ass
Million dollar nigga, they call it socks in the air
When the bullets from above, man, they started spraying
It's just another story from the road
Where we keep a tough team and those guys don't play
75 nigga ball, rest in peace to bubble
I like my remmy and my rose, bud is [?]
Keep winning and keep losing
You keep hating and your bitch keeps choosing
Do you think she doesn't?
There are not too many black models sitting everywhere
That, that, that, that, that, that's Maaly Raw!
Lying in an Aston, ten hoes in a mansion
Only two of them natural, another eight all made of plastic
They don't want to go to college but the brain is smart
Make me want to do Heisman when I drink the right medicine
Ball player, ball player, cradle in the Himalayas
Heavy weight, fish scales, blue bird in the mail
Could go flood the Patek
I'm in the jewelry box, 200 cash
I tell that nigga to break my neck
I'm with your bitch and she tore it apart
She comes to the kitchen, you love her to death (ew)
Kicking that shit like Bruce Lee
Zone, zone, zone, no 2, 3
I'm not going to fuck your sushi
Stack that paper like a loose sheet
Lift the hood, we're too deep
Big Maybach, like 'forgive me
My dead friends like Uzi's
I don't play without fools, hell no!
Lying in an Aston, ten hoes in a mansion
Only two of them natural, another eight all made of plastic
Make me want to do Heisman when I drink the right medicine
Ball player, ball player, cradle in the Himalayas
Heavy weight, fish scales, blue bird in the mail
Pick up drugs with the U-Haul (drug)
Cold doll like Utah (burrs)

Swimming in drugs to the knees (drug)
Gang Migo, the streets need us (gang)
DreamChasers, the streets need us

Keep your eyes on that path when you're pushing yay
Extra percentage for my killer
No witness, no evidence (no evidence)
Put them all in a coffin
Lying in an Aston, ten hoes in a mansion
Only two of them natural, another eight all made of plastic
They don't want to go to college but their brains are smart
Make me want to do Heisman when I drink the right medicine
Ball player, ball player, cradle in the Himalayas
Here comes the mail, I want to scream

Package shipping via FedEx
Price goes up and down like NASDAQ
Pick up a supermodel in the Bat
Hit her, make her take a taxi back
You put your bitch on the black shelf
I make my hoe bring that money back
Water whip, 28 jumps, yes
Boom trap house, feds on the doorstep
Nigga like, "What do you want?", Yeah
We roll dice in a PC
I put you bitch in 3 ways
I hit her for replay
And she brings it back like a DJ
Lying in an Aston, ten hoes in a mansion
Only two of them natural, another eight all made of plastic
Make me want to do Heisman when I drink the right medicine
Put my bitch on the streets, put your bitch on the shelves
Feeling like Blue's clues, here comes the mail, I want to scream
Only two of them natural, another eight all made of plastic
They don't want to go to college but their brains are smart

Put my bitch on the streets, put your bitch on the shelves
Heavy weight, fish scales, blue bird in the mail
Feeling like Blue's clues, here comes the mail, I want to scream
My neck is full of hate, my wrist is full of jealousy
When I was 18, it was when I caught my first serious crime
Now I'm on a Phantom, just a cruise like Penelope
All this shit shit, shit, are you selling me niggas?
They took me to the studio, rapping; making melodies
Nightmares of being bankrupt, man, I'll be having flashbacks
Nigga fucks my bitch, better ask her where the money is
Nigga broker a joke, why do you think you laugh?
I'm a rude boy, Top Shotta like Mad Max
We were at the club, she said to me: "Teach me how to fuck."
He took her to lofts and said "Teach me how to suck it"
She only wants to fuck me because she knows I get that money
I don't know what that bitch thinks, she can't get a dollar from me!
We dance to the maximum, all we know is to spend it
She is on my cock because I do a lot of paper
And I know that I am winning because I make many enemies
Swag at 100, my wrist froze
Money, cash, hoes; that's all a black knows
I have to go to court tomorrow, and I wear my Audemar
And all of that in D.A., kill them on a weekday
He only hit her once and now he wants an instant replay
I'm about to start selling dick, put it on eBay
All the girls will buy it, you should come and buy it
I will let you eat it all; put you on my cock diet
Shit, not only am I spitting bitch, I'm getting rich
Blacks say they get money, come on shut up
We dance to the maximum with him, I'm in a Maybach, I'm in the back
Shout out to Lil (?) Him on the track with him
2 9s as a hit em; Warren sapp with it
Shit, I think I'm married to him (?) Every day
Nigga crossed the line, I'm an em em (?)
Actually no, I'm fucking all your bitches anyway
We dance to the maximum, all we know is to spend it
And go and get it back
She is on my cock because I do a lot of paper
And I know that I am winning because I make many enemies
Swag at 100, my wrist froze
Money, cash, hoes; that's all a black knows
Money, cash, hoes, that's all a black knows
Cash, hoes, that's all a nigga knows
Cash, hoes, that's all a nigga knows
Nike Flow; I just do it, just do it, just do it, just do it, just do it
Listen, I'm the definition of a monster
Sitting like a gangster
Revolver in my lap, barrel full of black claws
I lick it in your sqaudron, roll it up, like "wait"
Start spitting as I drive
You better niggas slow down, before they fuck
I aim, let it burn, blow your brains to shit
For all your shirt, since I was young I went crazy
Everything on earth, screaming ma "Fuck you!"
For all that yolk and get your damn broken egg
Yeah you know who the fuck is
BM, say no more, falling back with Meek Mill, man (yeah)
Listen to that crack music man
For the real man, niggas shit (all of you niggas shit for real man)
If you niggas ain't pushing, repeat yet, man
Press repeat and shuffle

Who else do you know has all the flamers, nobody?
Real fucking man, listen to Chi records
It's our nigga city
Yes, I took my rap money and went to buy some kilo (s)
Letric bill audemar, lighting up as PEECO
Word to my blocked friends, flow of "free my black Reek"
Glock 4pound will put your brain on the wall
Let me tell you why they hate because they die
Yeah Weezy, tell 'em niggas kill themselves, head shot
Fred Flintstone, bitch, I make your damn bed roll
So much ice in my Breitling popped my fucking gang
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe, pick a rapper
And I bet they're not in the middle of that shit they say or rap
I'm really into it, flowing with my ratchet
Every time I'm in the club, I know we take stairs (stairs)
Looking at them boys in persimmons and the alphabet
Because they don't want to see a young black man come out of the cat
Out of the hood, out forever, hating nigga, I've been good
The coupe like Bat Mobile, my bitch playing Robin Hood
Kobe said "pass them on" and I said "I put them right"
Kerosene heater flow, swagger in a million (swagger)
Every time I'm in shit they're like "you kill them"
Said I'm not in that shit, Black Eyed Peas "Okay, I will"
5 percent on everything so you don't see which wheel I'm on
Or don't you see what bitch I have
Ice on my wrist and look
I'm a cloud jumper prolifically take me to the top
Drama, take me to my Glock so I can get a strap
And I'll be with that white boy, fucking with that Casper
Laughter, cuz I can play and yell at them niggas
Lawnmower with that semi, cut your niggas, buckle up niggas
"Who are you with?" Talk about me, when you see me it's the remix!
I said fly like shit, take that purple, light it up
Think it's sweet, then try your luck. Do you need a murder? Contract us
Shooters, always on deck. Just waiting to light
Send them to you niggas, they'll listen like I'm connected
Tell that to hold on, "bitch, go pick up the pliers"
Catch me in an SRT, coolin, burn them
I hear you niggas got that job, we called you on the phone and put you online
Cash rules everything around me and near me
Tell them hoes I don't do singles, they can share me
I don't want to talk or do business if it's scary
Lil niggas should never have seen Tom and Jerry (rat!)
Break a brick, catch a whip, lift my jewelry
Pay a couple of bills, rest, and then an equipment outage
Catch me in the vip bottles popping my tool
Hating ass niggas makes me sick, fuck my mood
Swagger at a million, trillion, trillion
The whole gang broke out, big rocks, killing them
My city is bigger than the mayor
Ask the streets, say that I am everything I say I am is
I went to jail, I came back as A.I. did
And put my city on the real rap map! (Mr. Philadelphia)
When I say weak, you say bitch
Weak bitch, weak bitch
I don't want basic bitches, basic bitches
I don't want basic bitches, wait a minute motherfucker
White niggas are talking hard
Talking shit until we get your card out
Take your chain, hit you
Fuck your bitch, wipe yourself
My niggas wylin ', we wylin' wylin '
My niggas wylin ', we'll be wylin' we wylin ', wylin'
My niggas wylin '
And I don't want basic bitches
She told me that her ex was a black bitch
So I told him to put me on the 'Gram
And now he on my line talking recklessly
But if you try to get wet then
Running with my niggas in the low-low
We on the south side, talking gangster
I'm really out, bustin 'with my four and four
Right there on the south side, watching the po-po
Sharper than a motherfucker
We get money like a motherfucker
She sucking dick for red bottoms
Get it?
I know exactly what Meek is talking about
I took your basic butt and then I went crazy
You broke niggas, you can stand left
Rich niggas right with their guns out
Playing with a cat, he pulled out his whiskers
I got 'Rari and Bentley, and Fiskers out
Wait, what the hell is this nigger talking about?
I, take off, take off the Mac-11
Get up like Big Worm, I want my money on Friday
And you can have your basic bitches
Take off, I make work disappear like a magician
Take that envy and then stop in the kitchen, make me a chicken
I hit that pot like a chemist, bat money like it's tennis
I pray the Lord be my witness, nigga, I'm stacking them benjis
And all these diamonds around my neck, I put on two chinchillas
Leave my top in the winter, get paid at the Beverly Center
Go to my jeweler in Cuba, get diamonds below the temperature
Bitches run down the hall, rip them off, but not Timberlands
Your bitch pulls my trap without knocking
Like soccer, she receives penalties
I tell you, I tell you
One yourself when 2 niggas run with 3 gats
A four, five, six shots, seven like eight claps
And the MAC 11 hidden where it gives 12 gauge in
When I was 13 I had 14 grams of ajax
Turned 15 and started spitting 16 seconds of straight crack
At 17, 18th street where I played that
19 niggas in the corner 20 years old and tied up
Playing with my money like playing with my emotions
Floating off that water like I'm lying in the ocean
Roastin, I make you disappear, hocus-pocus
We leave these suckas like Jerry Rice, wide open
In the field to be real, you block slow motion
Gotta catch a nigga sleeping late at night, hit 'em with the toaster
Make him put it all up like he's playing poker
Because I remember days, nights, I couldn't even think well
I wouldn't even blink like
Flashes once, blinks twice
Because that would take your life
Faster than a Tyson match
Approaching the scene
So fresh so clean
I'm depressed enough and my whole year will be low
Red horse, red stripes
Tell me to stop because i'm killing them
I have chains like millions
Lick that they don't feel, but tell them to keep hating
Praying in my fall, tell them to keep waiting
I'm here i'm there
Wear them rocks in rocawear
I'm so flying without a glance
Why would I lie? No, I do not care
I ride that fire without fear, I keep that choppa on deck
If an enemy attacks me, hit it without rat
It's big business, big bills, and big choppas
Cherry Red Challenger, looks like a lobster
All the niggas D are at it, hoes holla
Why do they compare us?
And I still have the block jumping, Shawn Marion
He doesn't dig me from where I just buried them
We count money, bitches, we go super hard
Maybach relaxed, looking like a superstar
Diamonds on my neck, shining on them like a shooting star
30 in the clip makes me feel like an escort
Stop me little but I'm arrogant
Pull up on the hood 4 doors Mazeradi
Eye-catching jewelry like a paparazzi
Copy, I'll probably be in the hills of Cali
In the million dollar cradle eating shrimp and broccoli
Look at me, Pilladels shuttlecock, no hockey
Tell your girl to Google me, she can call me
She doesn't have to chase me, just tell her myspace me
Got the thugs on deck, they ride hard like Kowazakis
They ride hard, I said they ride hard
Kated by DTSes
Like Khalid's shit, we are the best and
I tell you I don't want to talk, just leave a message
Automatic boxes so they can see the weapons.
Just ah, no, I don't love these girls, I just love when I fuck them
Let me keep it clean, keep what I say?
I said I said I said
I have money on my mind, change in my membrane
Crazy in the kitchen with the whip game
Similar to Gordon, throw it in the pyrex
I would like to receive your order? Ounces a quarter
Omelly pushed the rock, I pushed the mist forward
20s have a niggas floating like him in the water
Of course we do, we have packages for a Goya
This sawyer on my hip, dyed in the rora
Bad lil chick with me, looking like Kimora
Carry that is me in Yora's pocket
Long hair nice juicy ass and Coutura
20, 50, hundreds, nigga, it's all in my hands
Chewin like it's double mint
That 40 has a double clip
Automatic magnum like a condom with a rubber grip.
And these suckas get out of line and we're going to screw them
I hug that strip, on the block, with that Yao Ming
Now I want to say, oh, hear when I speak
I got that white girl and that green lady like Fairmount Park
And this nigga thinks he G, I bet he fears when I spark
Put some hot shit in his tea, he'll be lying down, chalk
Where is the? There he goes
Pull that slow nigga
I have that clip of ruga like rula shootin like a video
And we'll be ridin, ridin, slippin, slidin
All over town with that semi right next to him
Ballin like Jimmy, and that nigga tries and tries
I said now they start and stop and they search us, niggas become childish
But they're not really stopping shit, that's only going to bring a cop here
We're competent common sense cause niggas rock this shit
Where they always hate, you'll never get a compliment
I'd rather do a 5 to 10, nigga before I lose my life
Come out in a blaze of glory, screeching with my tight trigga
Damn my nigga Rick
Damn where my nigga Brick
As time goes by, I think of you, I know you're tired and sick of it
Then they said my nigga sucked, I could never see that
Speaking of which they have statements about him, wait let me read that
Believe
He was taking drugs from life, about to relapse
Gud gang, also known as Ladder Boys, we return
We came back
said
I don't make it rain, I'm not rich
I don't have a milli, I'm not trying to chase a bitch
Yes, I signed, but I have no bricks
And I keep going at the club feeling like I'm Mitt
We have Squally in the building, he will be tied there
I'm in the crowd, just chilling out
Peepin off the scene, I see an enemy that reacted
They call us Ladder Boys because we understand it
We don't make robbin, all we do is grind
Everyone knows I'm about to explode like a bomb, boom
Stop at Impala '96, vroom
Hammers in dirty stash, broom
The cover on the passenger, gangster, thug
Yes i do my thang
Uh, I said, I said
Yeah i'm in shit yeah i do my thang
I'm not going to give you that, I'm going to let Raw give you that man
I do my thang man, I scream at my boy Oskee
I said they gave my nigga 20 years, man he wasn't even well
Got it in the hell hole, living at the speed of light
Praying that time will pass and I can see the light
Watch your children meet a wife, all in a white hue
But why do you think they take that time away from you, because you need it well?
And you can't get it back, so how do they bring people to life?
That's why I never waste time, I appreciate every minute in
Man, half of that shit I do, explode
I don't even take it easy
Because any day could go
And I could see my death date, feel my last breath
That's why I go and get it now
I'm like shit wait
Die young, and the bag doesn't even last
Where young niggas 16 and older quickly die in
I was made there, raised there, but I passed that
Livin at the speed of light, it seemed like a flash
I have no money, I broke and then they returned the cash
This is why I never appreciate anything I can have back
However, grateful for my life, I wish I could hide that
To be here today to stop tonight
I just hope that when God comes to arrest me, read my rights, read my mistakes, ah
Rest in peace with Shotty also man. Rest in peace all my boys man
Jail is for no one, man. I'm Meek Milli, I'm in the building, Bad K's studio, Flamerz.
All day. Do you want a little more?
I say wait, I'm in my routine
I rush every day
And I'm not going to 9 to 5 but you can get that 9 for 5
We got that, ay ay bae bae, come my way
Everything will be fine
Even rooms have a few ounces of niggas know we got that way
But ay ay ay
I remember dog we used to be slaves
Now we beat that target like it's Kuntakente
Oh, all we know is the hustle and bust
Grind the muscle just to lie down in the shade
Because I am the man in my city
And nobody fucks me
I'll be rolling through your ridiculous hood with the semi
They'll be rolling on that well, I'll be showing up on that chicken
Ridin dyed in the SR, you with that hemi
See that bad girl? That's all i'm at it
I say this and she does that
I go in, they like "Who is it?"
I brought you choppas in the building, we'll really make noise
He said we will really make noise
We brought them choppas in the building. We'll really make noise, boy!
All that ass, Lord, have mercy
All that champagne, these thirsty bitches
I prolly lift Roberto over Cavalli
Puffin 'in Cali, prolly in the valley
Drinking something drowsy, twerkin 'bitches like Miley
Twerk, twerk for a real nigga sales job
I promise I won't say a word
I've been in that trill shit a long time ago
Get shot in the head while driving your Maybach
Homey D Clown knows I don't play that
Try to teach me, I leave early
Drug dealer, Puma life, behind this soccer jersey
Mink draggin ', tell PETA I'm swaggin
All these karats like he's trying to lure a rabbit (Dag!)
Just to put it (Put it where?) In my jacket (In my jacket)
(What are they asking?) What are you doing? (What are you doing?) Making fashion
I could use each chain and mix it with my fur
I could take each gulp and mix it until I blur
I tell the bitch to get on my lap, but don't make me nervous
I need that bag full of green like a lawn mower
Yeah i put it down and i'm hitting
If her pussy is good then she could one, two, three, the fourth round
I depressed her for that
Yeah nigga think too much, never under stress
Yes I understand, your girl is over, I'm so impressed
But if I don't have that rubber, I feel badly dressed
Yes, and I have bags of money under my eyes, because I can't sleep
All of them Goyard too because I'm not cheap
Finally the famous Aura Gold is my I-N-C
And I set everything in motion like I-N-G
I got this monster to 3rd base, she tries to run home with us
And I have a coma in a coma in a coma in a coma ... in a coma
And I'm not talking about not running in prayer
And I piggyback in that pussy like my black Meek Milly
On my way to meet Millis
I got rich, I decided I wasn't rich enough
When I made it big, bitch, I decided it wasn't big enough
Damn, the template is ready, you little bitch
I'm like Madoff but I ran away, planning to pay the niggas
You never pressed yay, dawg, I don't see keys like Ray Charles
We have your dog in a big house, she is exaggerating like "Hi Ross, how are you?"
I'm in the Kardashian, do you understand? I'm lying, can't I pretend?
They say it's fake until you get it, well let the fake start
I got a bitch with fake tits, fake ass, all in the Benz
Tits will drop like a ball when she bends
My blacks from Harlem and Philly get it
Your bitch comes and then we fuck her and her friends
Come find a dream buyer, we dance hard like the Lakers
You're playing, you're a faker, you're catching the fumes
Come find a dream buyer, we dance hard like the Lakers
You're playing, you're a faker, you're catching the fumes
I'm in your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor
I'm in your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor
I'm in your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor
I'm at your house on the hill, I fucked your girl and your neighbor, damn it!
She just lay her heart eyes underneath my nigga nigga
That's my bitch nigga
I bought him a first class ticket to put his cock in
When I was broke as a joke, people used to hate me
Now I am, I don't need your money
Hommie, I'll be fine, be fine, be fine
Hommie, I'll be fine, be fine, be fine
Back in the day Shawty no [?]
Now it's hard for me to keep Shawty away
But Shawty, I'll be fine, be fine, be fine
Shawty, I'll be fine, be fine, be fine
Shawty I'm fine
Now all of you on my dick back then were all on Peter's pipe
You're not used to [?] But when you see me you're [?] Twice
Have the nerve to tell me that I look good and now you see the ice
Look at the fame, speak my name
Little hoes just being hoes
Being [?] When I was locked up, those little hoes didn't even write
When I broke, my nigga [?] Put me
Hit me with those one hundred and forty-six and [?]
And I left
Nigga, I never look back
And I've been getting to the money since you heard that
Shawty, I'll be fine, don't worry about me
I don't need a bitch for shit
Just a pussy and some lips
Raise whips, think I was losing a while ago
Now these hoes try to jump on that Rover as it moves
What you expect money, power and respect
I know I'll be fine as long as the guy who got his [?]
Know that Gilie does not write checks
I don't give a shit
With about 7 or 8 monsters
And I know these bitches are sweet
Dick until we squeeze
Like the Ying-Yang twins
But we will not end them
They used to tell me bad luck
My sneaks were all worn out
Until I came to fuck
The baddest bitches here [?] I probably fucked her
And now these niggas flipping bricks couldn't even make it
T.I.P told me the same bitches the boss is fucking with
I'm going to fuck you now while you try younger
I said it was all or nothing
Fuck with the hoes, don't call or nothing
Ok Beemer Benz or Bentley Flow
Keep the baddest bitch
I call that bitch my Bentley ho
I put the limit of the sky
I don't travel in twenty fo

The cake does not add to my cake
They think about subtracting me
I make money multiply
Making me tryna bag on me
But as soon as my thugs hit them
Snitchin tries rat with me
Dammit
The same niggas who talk all that shit about money
Catch a case, can't even pay, they rescue
Now that's funny shit
.... and a rubber grip
I'm on that other shit
Ladder that is a double clip
I chew these bees like they were double peppermint
They say they go to the head, that?
Cake I get alota that

Strizzy in my glizzy cause

I've been that black for the diamonds and the chain
I've been that nigga to foreigners and clothes
I've been that nigga in the corner with more
I've been that black, I've been that black
My dog is a shooter, please don't send me that nigga
I've been that black, I've been that black
If you keep talking I'll make you nail that nigga
I have bitches in Paris who write "Ooh la la"
I replied, "Who is this?" She replied: "You forgot"
Real niggas gon 'link up
But my city H spilling drink
Just me and Junior in Brinks' truck
Doing all this shit we don't think about
Trying to freak out because we got in a bad mood
I'm tapping that pink thing
Maraj puts that pussy on me
Ten gangs throw their mink
I have all the money on my mind ho
What do you think I'm dying for?
My niggas my niggas
My niggas, my hitters, finna we'll be richer
I'm talking about bigger and bigger
They steal my loot just look at my photos
I've been that nigga for the money and the fame
I've been that black for the diamonds and the chain
I've been that nigga to foreigners and clothes
I've been that nigga in the corner with more
I've been that black, I've been that black
My dog is a shooter, please don't send me that nigga
I've been that black, I've been that black
If you keep talking I'll make you nail that nigga
I blew half a kilo on my Cuban link to see it swing
Dodging on my Wraith, I should stop at church
Make these niggas play with me, the devils wish it was a hearse
In my all black shades, the damn Ray Charles
I used to scrub the floors now, who's the damn boss?
I've been that nigga that could catch you both
White Coca-Cola, sour cream, butter, all in my coupe
I put my dogs on pay, you see we're all blowing hard
Chopper could still judge a jury, could bring this bitch to trial
I've been that nigga for the money and the fame
I've been that black for the diamonds and the chain
I've been that nigga to foreigners and clothes
I've been that nigga in the corner with more
I've been that black, I've been that black
I've been that black, I've been that black
If you keep talking I'll make you nail that nigga
You know I still believe, I still believe in you and me.
Because every night I go to sleep, I go to sleep
I can see it as a movie in my dreams.
Put my face in the dirt
Still, I get up to get the crown back, yeah
You can break my body
But you can't lock up a man's soul (Yeah huh)
Follow your dreams, not your addictions
How are we going to follow our dreams locked in a prison?
Deprive myself of my dreams but I'm relentless
I want the money, I never want attention
Because they don't see my vision
I'm glad when it was Christmas
We didn't even receive gifts, but we were gifted
At Failure School, we present perfect attendance
Well-being baby, we work with what they give us
He made me some commas, the judge still gave me a sentence
No period, city girls don't freak out when it's really real
Thank God you believe, be sure to pray when you kneel, yeah
You know I still believe, I still believe in you and me.
Because every night I go to sleep, I go to sleep
I can see it as a movie in my dreams.
Still, I get up to get the crown back, yeah
But you can't lock up a man's soul (Yeah huh)
My bank account was at super zero
There's never panic, I'm a superhero (Uh)
When God turned the heat on me, he said "You De Niro"
Let's play smart, because we are not playing checkers, this is chess, play your pawns
Sit like a king, when they move, leave your mark
And never let your competition take your heart (take your heart)
Say I believe in myself
When everyone stops believing, never go away
They had their backs against the wall, I had to lean
It almost made me put my dreams on the shelf, I'm tripping (I'm tripping)
Laws of attraction, you just think I'm rapping
I'm just taking out the energy so I can grab it
Everything in my memory that I imagined
It's finally here, a hundred million in a year.
I still believe, I still believe in you and me.
Because every night I go to sleep, I go to sleep
I can see it as a movie in my dreams.
You can break my body
But you can't lock up a man's soul
The fallen, (the fallen) rest in peace (R.I.P.)
While I lie down (while I lie down) I lie down to sleep (to sleep)
Please God take care of me
You know I'm going to talk my shit
Because I can walk my shit
Since my son died, 4-5 is what I'm walking with
5 bullets we talk fast
I burn every clue I take, I'm an arsonist
And my flow is the most amazing
You can tell if I'm there when they are in the air
That garbage is like a skunk with its tail in the air
That sucked, yeah, that gank had my eyes back
About six ounces, 4 xans made me nod on my lap
Stuck in a puzzle, no pieces to map
This shit is really much deeper than that
This shit gets deeper than rap
Nigga, I'm hungry, can you hear the way I speak on my way
If I can't teach you, then I'll drop you back
Like thick bitches with the knitting on their backs
I tell you once that we'll just leave it at that
Because I live in the place of the highest murder rates
If your eyes are on me, then my eyes on you
Take your eyes off me before my boys on you
I'm going to fuck Homie and put some shots on him
I swear to God, friend, you need your God with you
Because if my squad with me, they will ride on you
You cannot survive, friend, he is not alive.
Telling everyone, a hammer will hit you like a nail through the wall
All my life niggas blood then I fall
I'm not Jada, so I don't ask why
I'm in shit like a fly
For all my niggas who died
The way we lived the Ima tradition keeps it alive.
(Verify ... Verify, listen)
I am ambitious and hungry
These damn bitches are on me
For the grown-ups, we'll hit you, buddy
With 20 in his 40
Cancel a nigga for me
They are dirty, thirsty and hungry
Watching over my goal
Waiting for this guy
The helicopter under my armpit
Waiting for it to move
It's Meek Milly, Bloodhound nigga holla back
I said Meek Mill terrible, Flow unbearable
I'm talking about air, 4-4 clear it up
For all of you little buzzards, better listen to me
I take out cannons
Because I'm not trying to fight, I have a pound that sounds like a quarter of a stick of dynamite
I'm in the kitchen with a white porcelain jug
Try to spank him, hit him harder than a Tyson
Back to the basement with him, basic niggas with him
I fuck hoes, you chase them bitches
It is a difference with me, there is no bitchin 'with me
Because I just caught the pound with the laser
To erase a nigga, if he jumps out of his pocket, I grab him, I go out and pick him up, and I make him come out of his pockets.
We smoke and drink liquor for all the real niggas we lost here, man it's hard here
I do it and I will do it until tomorrow out here
'Cause time is running, and niggas are running free here
I took the wrong left turn, because this can't be right
No, this can't be how I thought it was going to be
Because I have seen a couple of young people trapped in front of me
What the hell is going on but we can move on
Because we ride every day on top just selling you
Until I'm gone, Ima push from the muscle, cause I learned that only the niggas who survive are the strong
Niggas come on I can't complain now it's the life we choose
Only the life we know ...
You can look me in the eyes and see inside, it's a devil in me
Told me to leave a nigga if you ever tempted me
So if I die, it's my time, black, obviously
All I speak is money
I have a bad bitch in my Chevy
Sell Miley Cyrus in my new Monte Carlo
A quarter of a million hanging from my neck
Half a million in my duffel bag (duffel bag)
Now I'm riding on my Cadillac (Cadillac)
Hammers and the fucking vogues
I'm cleaning and I'm fucking hoes (ha)
Ok i woke up this morning it's time to get this money
Ya niggas was yawning and had made around 20
I say, yeah, nigga, that's it, he says yes, nigga, we're on
I said I'd be on my way, knock down a brick in all areas
And I have a job, I have a job
And I have pills, and I have purp
And I have thugs who are on my team
If I say it and I say go
And they go to ham, and I go to bed
I let go of my eggo
And this for sale nigga
28 grams on my nigga scale
I have a bad bitch in my Chevy
Sell Miley Cyrus in my new Monte Carlo

A quarter of a million hanging from my neck

Now I'm riding on my Cadillac (Cadillac)
Hammers and the fucking vogues

Wait wait a minute
You got the richest and richest niggas in the building
Feel me?
Ho nigga wanna knock you unconscious

Art of war, customary law
Dope boy in my DNA
Straight Chips, Frito Lay
8 clips, ay Jose
I'm screaming rest in peace, Griselda Blanco

Benzo on the nigga 4, counting all my nigga hoes

I have a bad bitch in my Chevy
Sell Miley Cyrus in my new Monte Carlo

A quarter of a million hanging from my neck

Hammers and the fucking vogues

Bad bitch and she talks dirty
He talks dirty, his mouth clean
I was selling that white shit
Niggas already have boy scout dreams
Spend Iguodala on my Rolly
Young nigga ball as Kobe
Riding around me and Chino
And my young black Goldie
However, they haven't seen you hot whips
Two eleven in your bitch
Turn the head she stole
My neck looks like a light show
My pocket, they need lipo
I stand tall, not Eiffel
And those thugs go where I go
Ya'll niggas pussy like dyke hoes
All we know is that they pay you black
I dance hard like LeBron James
I have a bad bitch in my Chevy
Sell Miley Cyrus in my new Monte Carlo
I have to Justin Bieber please believe it
A quarter of a million hanging from my neck
Half a million in my duffel bag (duffel bag)
Now I'm riding on my Cadillac (Cadillac)
I'm cleaning and I'm fucking hoes (ha)
Oh man, I wish I knew, I wish I knew then
But I don't let it stop you know I will come back again
All the mistakes I've made, problems I've been on
I wish you knew me when I was young
You could see me and how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Please, oh yes, believe me
Until third grade everything was like, fourth and fifth grade were the tough days
It was the wish to have a car day, because all the butlers they were catching were all paid
The cops who catch us wouldn't say a word like our jaw broke
Imagine me back then, look at me right now
Preforming in front of twenty thousand on the microphone now
I took a couple of cases, I had to channel
I was living in the dark, now I'm in the light
You grind hard, then you shine stronger
I'm getting tough like my last name Carter, Dwayne, Sean and Vin
Who will play my life if I am born again?
Oh man, I wish I knew, I wish I knew then
Made me the person you see standing here
I wish you knew me when I was young
You could see me and how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Yes, you don't have to listen to me, you don't have to believe a single word I say
No, that's what my mother told me, I still went out and learned the hard way
And I've been crying, no no, I've been crying, no no
Oh yeah she told me to grow up I grew up and stood up now every day I move again
Oh man, I wish I knew, I wish I knew then
I wish you knew me when I was young
You could see me and how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Please, oh yes, believe me
Without a dollar in my name, I wasn't thinking about rap
I say change for the better, I never think of going back
Should be a power ahead
Shitting so much I think my bathroom is out of order
Take them out of the box, they like a fish in the water
But I, I'm going to survive, put it in my Ma I swear to God
How are you going to win when you never try
I can see my future as if I'm living in a mirage
Every day I'm living life like I could never die
Old clothes in my closet, new whips in my garage
New watch on my wrist saying this is my time
So don't judge me, just love me
There's nothing on top of me
My future is very beautiful, say that God does not like the ugly
Oh man, I wish I knew, I wish I knew then
But I don't let it stop you know I will come back again
All the mistakes I've made, problems I've been on
Made me the person you see standing here
I wish you knew me when I was young
You could see me and how far I've come
So don't judge me, you don't know me
Please, oh yes, believe me
Big bench takes small bench
Drop one into the fish tank
I have sharks in lean
Big bench takes small bench
Drop one into the fish tank
I have sharks in lean
Fish scale for all my equipment
Look how the pogo is going to stop
Cake my birthday blow them
Candles baby please don't blow me
It's a band-aid on your forehead I have people in me
In my pockets he said set me free to heaven
This is a great bank talk that is frequent as it is
I swear money like doubly hot chili
Potato chips bag
No lord, no shoes, no loot
I'll get cash, I'll put that title by my name
The hottest lighters, I'm a fire and they have to aim
I just left the title game
Didn't they drive you trying to block me?
Big bench takes small bench
Drop one into the fish tank
I have sharks in lean
I say in the Benjamins, swimming pretty in
And they don't talk money
It's just my friend
Pull up on so sexy when the edge of the motor
Wrinkle, wrinkle, screw that
Cost like 7 birds
Browse my swimming in that money
She in love with money

Have you ever seen a dream come true? (Have you ever seen a dream manifesto? ...)
It looks like nothing (it looks like nothing, it looks like nothing, it looks like nothing)
DC2
If you don't have a dream, you have nothing
Many niggas changed me when I got money
He said he came with the game, and this is what he wanted
So I'm in a rush like the first time I faced
For the love of green and the love of the team.
Make a circle that can't get in the way
No they don't want me to go
But I have to go get it
Time is money and I'm on a mission
Cops run in my sister's crib, I swear I have to find a way
I try to touch a million dollars and I'm a penny away
Never ask a nigga for a brochure, I'd walk away
Write my little blows, smoke my little grass
I sold some crack just to finance my little needs
I was sixteen years down on my knees
Asking the lord to help me get some cheese
I was hard (hard) at the same time I was outside
In the jungle where the niggas will rip your heart out
Cold summers where niggas will probably starve
Wanna be a king to see the niggas come out?
You could blame us, they were trying to chain us
But we were trying to fix the roof leak when it was raining
We were trying to keep the house warm when winter came
But rather they arrest us, they lock us in cells with strangers to raise us
Animals go in cages
That's what the slave masters told the workers when they enslaved us (enslaved us ...)
Little town (little town), big dreams (big dreams)
I've been waiting for this day since I was sixteen (sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (sixteen)
I've been waiting for this day since I was sixteen (sixteen)
Little town (little town), big dreams (big dreams)
I've been waiting for this day since I was sixteen (sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (sixteen)
I've been waiting for this day since I was sixteen
R.O.C. the man told us "The sun doesn't shine"
You know that if his dad is in a hurry, then his son is going to grind
His father was locked up, now his son was doing time
Two major crimes on his record, he got one more time
Get an app, imagine you don't want a job
Lost hope, some niggas don't even want God
They just want some money just to fly
‘Because no one ever listens to the broken nigga
‘Because when you broke up, you considered it a black joke
If you're a joke, you considered him a nigga
And no black wants to live life living poor black
Little town (little town), big dreams (big dreams)
I've been waiting for this day since I was sixteen
Selling white girl, I'm talking about Christine
Young boy with dreams of touching that big screen (Big screen)
Little town (little town), big dreams (big dreams)
I've been waiting for this day since I was sixteen (sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (sixteen)
I've been waiting for this day since I was sixteen (sixteen)
Little town (little town), big dreams (big dreams)
I've been waiting for this day since I was sixteen (sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (sixteen)
I've been waiting for this day since I was sixteen
It is big business, big bills, and big helicopters.
Cherry red challenger with lobster appearance
All the black D's in it hoes scream
Scrolling through your area, why are you comparing us?
I'm serious, the number on my check seems like a series
And I still have the block skipping Shawn Marion
I see an enemy that disrespects me and then I'm transmitting them
We count money bitches getting super tough
Relaxed, Maybach looked like a superstar
Thirty in my clip made me feel like an escort
Two forties give a black eighty as Shockey
Pull up on the Maserati four-door hood
Eye-catching jewelry like a copy of paparazzi
Look at me, Philadel Flyer no hockey
Tell your girl to google me, she can com
She doesn't have to chase me just tell her Myspace me
And maybe she can find me so I can back it up
Got the thugs on deck, they ride hard like Kawasaki
Swag so sick my money is medicine
Delaying black newbies in your ass like a veteran
I still do my thing while I see the letter, man
I had to break down the door, those pussies wouldn't let me in
I'm here now i said i'm here now
I had to break down the door, those pussies wouldn't let me in
Meek Milly nigga what what
I'm making money like a motherfucker
Windows darker than the bitch but I can see
I have everything, you have nothing, that's why your bitch is on me
I know why you're mad, nigga yeah
I know why you're mad, nigga
Jahlil Beats, holla me!
My doll like "blaow"
You niggas sound so old, I look like now
Because I am young and I understand it
P bigger in my fitted
My money comes with those bitches
My bank account is full of commas and my pockets are full of hundreds
Bounce with me, smoke an ounce with me
That nigger selling bricks? Tell her to bring a house with her
My nigga like a wide receiver, run a route with him
He shows you how to get it in and out with him
I mean all my niggas speak bricks
My children don't rap
Hanging around with that Mac, whoa
I'm getting money, I'm fucking hoes
I got a hoe that's on that fucking pole
And she'll be on that damn pole
And that means that she fucking [?]
I like bitches and money, I like money and bitches
Yeah she's famous we're screwed but it's none of your business
All these niggas hate each other, I don't fuck with them niggas
I let the niggas keep hating, I keep fucking the bitches, wassup
I say bitch, shake that ass, I'm going to shake my tits
Bitch shake that butt like you work in Magic City
She loves the crew, I'm not talking about Drizzy
That's what we sell
It's black and yellow
Philly in the building
That's what i stand for forever
I'm talking about PA yelling at the DJ
Haa Uh - uh, you know what it is
When we are in the building we do it in a big way
Yes, they recovered me with delayed growth
100 thousand homie mixtapes that is nothing
Come to my city, you can see that I'm handling everything
Black Ice, yellow chick
Hella bad thick hella, smart brains
I'm in that wide body, I'm talking elephant
Big ghost leaning over there like he's running ben
Riding with the thugs, you know they're bent
Drink in that water sip purple and yellow
Team laker, I'm a dreamcatcher
Let the team take it, I'm a team player
Yeah you know I'm a damn beast
I'm talking about Chris Bosh, Lebron, and Wade
I will not say that I am rich, but they pay me a little
Uh-huh you know what it is
Everything you do is small, and everything we do is big.
Got that job, nigga, serve, sesame street with the big bird
Yes, you already have 15 curb clips, bring your girl
Let's er er, Pittsburgh
Black and yellow, I'm in the back like hello
Shit, I'm just increasing my enemies, like Shorty L - O
I spent 20 on the ghetto bezzle and shorty
You are absolutely right, I am at it every night
I'm flying like every pilot, I'm high like every kite
When I was on these streets I had to wear white
But now I'm rapping, I just spit it out, I just don't write!
Jaa Uh-huh, you know what it is
When Philly in the building, we do it big
We in this bitch
I keep counting money
Still spitting that shit
What are you going to do now?
But follow me on twitter
@Me @MeekMill BIIITTTCCHH
Leggooo
You know what it is, when we're in the building
Speaking this, speaking that
I'm not in front black, I'm back
And it's nothing, because nigga I'm tied
You know what it is and you don't want the BIZ
Ha ha (echoes)
Poof, there goes the car
Poof, there goes the cradle
Woop, David Copperfield
David Copperfield, David Copperfield
Pouf, one hundred mills
Woop, David Copperfield
David Copperfield, David Copperfield
Could you hit that hoe? Could you blame that bitch?
Cause you wanna roll with a real nigga like me
So go and suck on that dick like a hoe to a demon
I have YSL on my clothes and dripping blood on my sneakers
Nigga, you hate me, she chose
And I'm not going to fuck your girl, she played
My shifter, she drove she did everything she posed
I took out my camera and she posed
I've got the top back, in a fall back, I'm back
Where is the clock? Leave that, you have that, you have that
I have racks, you niggas are not about that, about that life
Poof, there goes the car
Poof, there goes the cradle
Pouf, one hundred mills
David Copperfield, David Copperfield
Poof, there goes the car
Poof, there goes the cradle
Pouf, one hundred mills
Woop, David Copperfield
Poof, niggas fuck your life, fuck all the niggas and fuck your wife
I got two bad bitches with a nigga and they don't know
They are going to fuck all night and I get hard
Niggas, pride of the doll game, I stop on the horse
And I'm sitting on all fours on a big disc
Call Big Boy Shot, all the clear stones on my Big Boy watch
All year long he has the strip in the lock
Every time we're in this bitch, man, she ain't gonna explode
My niggas have racks, your niggas will be out front
Red Cartier, red bone bitch, red bottoms on her
Long hair like shit, hold on, rub yellow gold, yellow bone hoe
Poof, there goes the cradle
Pouf, one hundred mills
Woop, David Copperfield
David Copperfield, David Copperfield
Poof, there goes the car
Poof, there goes the cradle
Pouf, one hundred mills
Woop, David Copperfield
David Copperfield, David Copperfield
I've been working all day, mmm until the sun goes down
Back pain, foot pain, but I still got to work
Who is going to save me? Hmmm, break every chain, hmmm
Take me away from this place and leave me away
Running like I know they'll come for me
I'm about to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Do not fear evil, to free all my people
If they crucify me, that's what it's going to be
Moses black, Moses, woah now
Moses black, Moses, woah now
Moses black, Moses, woah now
Moses black, Moses, woah now
Kill them all, that's the only minimal way to defend yourself
Leave them sitting at the door of death, the right way to send them
They will only beat me until sin is off or my skin is off
Some tried to run, they were tracked, now our limit is off
I'm just trying to find the North, let the stars design the course
I hope the mud can hide my scent, pray that the night can stop your horse
Got me chained, even made me change my name
But they couldn't catch my mind, this cry for freedom is not in vain
Look, they taught us half the story, they didn't know we came from glory
Years ago we were kings before ships came and drew me
Woo, I have to keep running, I have to keep running
Yah, because they keep shooting, and they keep coming
I'm about to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Do not fear evil, to free all my people
If they crucify me, that's what it's going to be
Moses black, Moses, woah now
Moses black, Moses, woah now
Moses black, Moses, woah now
Slaves, on the north side of Philadelphia
And go spend that money you made on designer
We shoot our brothers but we run away from the coppas
Let's go find a lawyer, a liar, that's offspring
To comply with the District Attorney's agreement
If we take it, I will go straight for victory
(Win, win, win)
We start as slaves, we get out of nothing
Over and over, 'profit and over, huh?
Little babies who were never loved
Then they run to the corner store
Water room only when they receive a hug
Get some coke, only when they have a job
Say it will explode in the first
Until they blew it up, now he rides in a hearse
People really, really out of work
Starving children have to work
Preacher even catching the church
Put shackles on my arm and leg
All those days made my body hurt
So we resort to prayer, waiting for God to work
Running like I know they'll come for me
I'm about to spill enough blood to fill the red sea
Do not fear evil, to free all my people
If they crucify me, that's what it's going to be
Moses black, Moses, woah now
Moses black, Moses, woah now
Moses black, Moses, woah now
Before this rap I was mopping to get cheap job now it will cost you 30 racks just to get cheap verse
Sheesh, I'm like R.I.P, I dropped 2Pac and did a B.I.G. It was America's most wanted as Chi Ali, for young people to do this, they need to see an ID
Ross said I'm hot, tip said I'm hot, Swizz said I'm hot, your girl said I'm hot, I went and bought a whip
Now my watch Fruity colors like Trix in a box, the money is not standing still now
I'm speeding it up like I'm still depressed, fools are talking like I'm still not around, they can't deal with me cause I have a deal now
Big Face Hundreds Big Face Rollies I'm casting Deuces Suckas They don't know me ...
MMG The team and I think I'm Kobe, I'm riding that thing with 20 years as Ginobli
G5 sitting on the track just to go live on Sunday, spend it and return on Monday. All my niggas rolling and us on that gun game, Meek Milli
You know who you are
You are not trying to impress anyone
Who do you have to impress?
You've been through the ranks
They gave you the test, you know what I mean?
And you stood up
That means you've been tested and stood up
So who do you have to impress?
You don't have to impress anyone, man
I know who you are, you know what I mean?
You should be yourself because I say if you do shit, man, for other people, then you're pretending
I don't need you not to be a fucking gangster to me
I need you to be a man
I have God watching over me from the court
Ballin 'like Jordan because I'm blessed
And the niggas want me to go, but I'm still alive
Wake up every morning feeling blessed
Appear in that Holy Spirit because I am blessed
I will do my best because I am blessed
I had to get my niggas out of the hood
It is outstanding that I am still standing
Macs are brandished when meat is sandwiched, blat, blat
Do it for my niggas which is a scam
In the corner with her running that tan
Duckin 'the Ds, cut the alley, scratch your trees
Throwing the profit and fuck your re
Start from a dollar, a pair of Gs
Time to kill them, nigga
I got an eight flipped and I'm dealing, nigga
Five hundred for the piece how I feel, nigga
That's why I'm not really feeling niggas
And if hoes fuck rats, I don't tell bitches
I guess I'm not really bitches to them
I have God watching over me from the court
Ballin 'like Jordan because I'm blessed
And the niggas want me to go, but I'm still alive
Wake up every morning feeling blessed
Appear in that Holy Spirit because I am blessed
I had to get my niggas out of the hood
Now we all eat well as we should because we bless
Blessings, stressed niggas
Mac on the dresser when I get dressed and never press
Crab in the barrel, look at the bucket, don't let them catch you
Because if they take you back to the bottom, you know you're going to suffer, fuck it
Therefore i am a hustle
New Wraith at Forgis
Muscle course
Of course I have a bubble, a new demon-red Porshce
Go skrt skrt through the lane on you
Niggas broke and you're more fake than that chain
I said to Tak when I see you go crazy
I can't D, call him man, I'll clear your way
You get some money, watch all these niggas change on you
That's why I changed them, I don't feel anything for them
Nigga, I'm blessed
I have God watching over me from the court
And the niggas want me to go, but I'm still alive
Wake up every morning feeling blessed
I had to get my niggas out of the hood
Now we all eat well as we should because we bless
I put on my niggas, what else will I do?
Give him a fucking fight for this money he bought mom a crib, my sister too
My grandmother later, she doesn't want to move
I throw some racks before going and buy some shoes for one of these bitches
This is my blues
Cause I'm back alone again
This is the blues that I'm playing
When the night is cold and lonely
(This is a hit of dollar bill)
Was it money that made me wild?
Poppin 'them Percs and I made it a habit
That was exciting for me, I'm so excited to be
We started with nothing, we had to inspire to be
Niggas ain't no flyer anymore than me, I'm getting to that
Feel like man, I have the plan
I call the shooters, they jump out of the van
Play with the squad, jump like a Xan
I'm going crazy with blacks, too wavy for blacks
Do magic like alakazam
Then straight to the jeweler, I'm a Rollie
I have the plug, he sent them OT
Even old niggas call me OG
We were in it when it wasn't round
Suddenly niggas want to come
This is my blues
Do me a favor, take a few steps back
Cause I'm back alone again
And then look at yourself
This is the blues that I'm playing
Congratulations, they're the damn hunters
Yes it's a good old thing
Do you feel Me? Us at it
When the night is cold and lonely
And show them a little love
You did me a favor, I knew you were a scoundrel
I knew you would show who you were
It's just a matter of time before the niggas line up
And hit slugs with them
Find in a pool of your blood, yeah, nigga
'Member told me we would fail
'Member said we would see a cell
Down with that semi like Cam Newton
I'm on the field like the NFL
Niggas is sick 'and I wish you well
I made a wish in a wishing well
I put a brick in a wishing well
I've been through shit and I'm sick of jail
No disease but I'm sick of cells
Sick and tired of sending black emails
Callin 'niggas just to get a bail
I never go home for a minute on the phone
Sick and tired of watching the niggas fail
Sick and tired of watching the niggas lose
Sinning like we try to go to hell
This is my blues
Cause I'm back alone again
Yes it's a final thing
When the night is cold and lonely
Make sure you know what you're facing now
I'm double digit
What are you talking about, nigga?
Time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
All exquisite
A couple of million on the sofa
Right here where I'm sitting
What's your body count nigga?
What are you talking about, nigga?
Bad bitches in the house
All exquisite
A couple of million on the sofa
Right here where I'm sitting
I got some bad hoes in my crib, knock stones on my couch
Scarface in this bitch, it's like a gun shop in my house
Whole bird on my desk, place it in ounces
The feds are looking at this bitch, oh lord, it's three hits and I'm out
I left
Thirty birds, I think we are going to need another kitchen
Now it is I who have the word to get a pair of pigeons
Send them to the hood and say goodbye
All my niggas lift weight but we don't exercise
Say ah!
What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digit
What are you talking about, nigga?
Bad bitches in the house
All exquisite
A couple of million on the sofa
What's your body count nigga?
What are you talking about, nigga?
Time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
All exquisite
Murder after murder, nigga, they don't listen to you
Man, shooters are so hungry
With bodies on fire
I could send them to your crib
And once they see you and confirm you
They'll rip your frame off
Damn rip your picture
And if they tell me
I could make them hit the witness
They've been out of them as a summons
Dawg don't make me give them business
Speaking of all that Killa shit now, what's your body?
Bounce shot will make your damn body bounce
What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digit
All exquisite
A couple of million on the sofa
What's your body count nigga?
I'm double digit
What are you talking about, nigga?
Time to get it
Bad bitches in the house
All exquisite
A couple of million on the sofa
Right here where I'm sitting
BH
I fell in love with the streets, yes, I was 16 years old (young)
Grinding like Clipse, try to get cream (let's get it)
A little nigga in the field, he was doing great things
Great hammers, great work, and had a great team
It was showing up when we had it green
Yes, we were dirty, the narcos try to sweep the strip
Plus we had that white girl, you know, that Christine
Aculera, that should challenge her, make a rich demon
Go bankrupt, try to fix dreams
Seeing the blacks cook the coke, it looked like whipped cream
And I was trying to get cake (I was hungry)
My old head would tell me just wait
But I was crooked, trying to straighten myself
The hundreds with the big face
The money made me feel great
Talking about ice cream
My heart was so cold that I had to thaw my lungs
Getting high, he was paranoid and he went hard with weapons
Ready to squeeze any nigga with ease
Nightmares of being killed, I believed
How the judge will blame me
Call me a criminal before tagging me as saying
North of jail and tuna soup and get melon
Tell them it rained yesterday but now it's cheering
It's death in the air, you can smell it
Man, they have the reaper around the corner trying to catch a body
Hungry young people up the street trying to catch someone
Slipping, they got their blacksmith and they are going to stretch some bodies
If you don't get paid someone will be sprayed
And a love to my niggas in the spinning cage
There is no food in the store without the lid tray
Guard spit on it, but you can feel your rib cage
Touch it so you're the shit I gotta live with today
You niggas fucking with them hoes, I'm fucking with them Benjis
I'm going to cut them, fuck with that stove
That shit you did last week, I fucked it on my clothes
Spend half of that on Prada and the other half on dros
I said nigga, will you do me?
That haze drove him to the area like a 23
Those niggas need to smoke, we got that oohwee
Purp per pound, ounces of D acid
We had 32 Glizzy's, compact to the max
Slipping through hood, dyed down, back to back
Skis, cocks and hoodies show where they are trapped in
Assassination murder cemetery, funeral service for em
We collect bosses, they assholes, anyone who works for them
Yeah meek motherfucker Milly
You niggas know what it is
BH, let's go straight to the damn day I die, nigga
Release my lil nigga
GT franchise we have the game in the lock
Chief
It is very difficult for me to sit here in this study.
Looking at a boy here, screaming my name
When last year I spent more money on spilled liquor
In bars from one side of this world to the other, of what you did
You're talking to the Rolex wearing
Diamond ring wearing, stealing kiss, woo!
Dealing with wheels, traveling in a limousine, flying in an airplane, the son of a gun
And it's hard for me to keep these alligators
These ass niggas ass
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
These ass niggas ass
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
Does anyone want to act crazy?
With whom? Numerous shots from .44
Young black man on the low low
Skipping the thing with a bad little bitch like YOLO
.44 on my hip line, this time no joke
In the hood where there is no hope
Now everyone is dirty like there's no soap
Everyone can rap when there is no coca
Where's the black money? Cop 44 a bird where I live
I probably buy the whole load if I get it back
I like fast cars, fast cars and my last car was like a NASCAR
Go vroom, vroom, then skrr, skrr 'before it takes off
She goes up and down like NASA, cycling life on your bitch nigga
Pop a wheelie all in that pussy, she shifts gears on this black dick
Still young, reckless and rich black, yellow diamonds like piss nigga
Shining stones nigga, you'll suck, don't do it like this nigga
These ass niggas ass
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
These ass niggas ass
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
That black there, that black there
Look at that nigga right there
That bitch there, that bitch there
You are not in that life, you are not in that
That price is not that
That shit you talk is not that
Niggas ain't about that action
You can keep your chain
My niggas don't want that plastic
Niggas talking about them got mils
Ok it's not real
I have a little watch, a little jewelry
They Self Made Niggas, Volume 3
Let the work pass like woo!
Shorty got that Ric Flair pussy like woo
These ass niggas ass
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
You all niggas slipping, with the window rolled up
That choppa with to whip
Choppa went to whip, there is no God, there is no priest
I'm on the verge of that life, I don't play no games, that damn silly shit
MMG, cut that check, plus a Rollie and a chain
You all fake niggas like reed rocks, roll the ghost, drop the top
Pussy nigga I hate 'cause I'm a star
Pussy nigga skate if around my car
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
You're not in that life, you're not in that yay
You have never seen a broken brick in entire trays
All I know is shooting
Hit my nigga gunplay night, broad day
I just sat in that cage, I made the cover
Kick the door where you stay
I'm not even trying to aim, everyone in that bitch catch a stray
I finished pushing that drop, I finished spanking that Mazi
I already turned that molly
You haven't seen a corpse, I held my drug thang
To see the niggas who shot them with their own blood
I had to wipe away mom's tears, she dreams that I'm dead
My niggas get bread, my niggas beat the feds
Every night I send a photo, my bad
You're not in that life, that life, keep 100 shots in that pipe
200 on my board, a thousand grams of that white
Sky Dweller my watch, two kilos my Cuban
On the court like Mark Cuban, are you getting money? Then show it black
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
It's not about that life, it's not about that life (it's not about that life)
I'm over that life, when the shit in sight, and they feel tight
You're a damn joke, what are you doing out there?
You are going to get hurt
This is not that movie, these weapons really shoot
And these packages really move
Do I need you M's and you niggas still playing?
I am trying to build my brand
What the fuck are you saying
I'm trying to bathe my bitches with black balls
Nino Brown, someone's baby mom
Fuck nigga, keep talking crazy
I'll buy your bitch and start claiming your nigga daughter
All my work from across the nigga border
If he's a fucking nigga, I'll shoot a nigga
When we stop, the hoes dazzle
Man these niggas ain't that life, no
And this shit they're talking about I got it twice
Bitch, I'm Diddy, fuck your advice
I said bitch, I'm Diddy, fuck your life
Ho shut your mouth when you're in the presence of kings
I really like LeBron but I have a couple more rings
I have love for all my hating niggas, I heard you said some things
You bitches niggas need love too, I could take you under my wing
Expensive car, Jack Nigga
Shooting don't ask a nigga
Gangsta was killed by a nigga rappin '
Rollie Gold, I'm Michael Corleone
Scarface bitch, got it going
Once for all the feds watching
It got big, my biggest plan
Niggas hate when you touch those 50M
Bentley White, I have five of them
Turn the corner on shiny wheels
Smiling like a nigga when he got a deal
Dying, always on my mind for real
Empire, always what I want to build
Hey hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey hey
We're getting money bitch
The nigga hates constantly but his bitch is mine
She says she loves the way those diamonds put me on the list
You need some plum juice that you're trying to shit on me
North side with whom already
I have some south side shooters that will make you fast
Got some niggas on the west side that'll move the bricks
And some niggas on the east side that will do the shit
It's the hustle in the building that we're moving bitch
Diamonds in that Audemar who is a stupid doll
I already have batteries on the deck
My nigga just hit me said you came back on deck
Wherever I move I keep a strap on the deck
Speaking of money, that's why
A nigga says it's beef, I'm thinking Outback
Forty [?], Pussies come back
I met her for ten minutes, all seven with her upper back
Rockstar lifestyle mike doesn't
Bottles of shit Ciroc could, don't chase it
I told the feds that I don't have any [?]
My niggas just fuck with that racist white
We are playing, I am talking Spalding
You're a weirdo, I'm talking about Carlton
At the club I tell [?] To leave me a bartender
Give it to the waiter, tell the hoes their open bar and then
I'm like the one who hates how you've been
I took my shine to the club and you know I have it
Baby I want a ménage and I know you have a friend
I'm a fucked up white boy
Run and tell other niggas that their luck is up
Whip speaks for me, says nigga, you're not as strong as me
Look speak for me, say bitch, come home with me
Glock speaks for me, says you don't want to rumble me
If you hit a punch, the shots will sting you like a bumblebee
You heard me it's rap
When I stop at an Aston, I killed that
I left
Let me brush my shoulders
Bowling ball glossy patent leather prada
Diamonds on my neck and wrist haters like him bragging
Cause I'm shitting these nigga everywhere and in general
Back off in my old fucking bout to make it cold for all of you
I pick up your bitch and her friend like she only wants to fuck both of them
Kilo fresh as you like soft sofa
Because I'm taking you fast, wait, let me phone
Meek Milly with the way you feel
My neck tells you I'm cooling my wrist, say I'm fine
I'm atrophy when I walk in. I don't dance in any way
I say let's bottle the hurricane pop Chris likes, hey bae bae
Steal your bitch right in your face and then, like Mike, I fade away
So tell them the lame stay out of my way before they shit on me all day
Mind in my business getting mine is my business
I get more out of rap than you do from cheating
First I got home, I was rapping, and then I signed for thirty stacks
And all this funny shit I hear made me laugh
Black Benz white wheels look like dominoes
Riding slow low cube you see me glowing hard
Cleaner than a house boarded with diamonds like a deck of cards
No, we don't have a job, but we have that target
What do you think what we do, birds don't [?]
Murder that kills you, the mac saves shells like a turtle
Niggas crazy because I'm eating niggas crazy because I'm eating
What they do in a year, blacks do on a weekend
Why do you think my diamonds here?
Earning money my career
Choppa-style thugs lurking when the sun goes down
Niggas throwing bullets trying to get a touchdown
You catch them like Fitzgerald nigga when that clip spills
Beat your allure, get home, and then get killed
Because real nigga shit in Filadel
I wet you and leave a hole in your head like the killer whale
He really fights that question from a nigger who answers
Black pussy softer than a pillow top mattress
Niggas throwing money, they don't even have a crib yet
And they still don't send money to their niggas making the offer
But you make it rain, you're a fucking lame
You get a concrete pillow in the coffin for your bed
Got niggas looking for you like you got money in your head
I'll kill you when I catch you, I'll kill you
I hear them pussies talking
They recklessly talk about me
But when I see them niggas, I'm gonna catch some remains of a body
Coppers walkie talkie, about retiring
I'm not stuck like in a year, but the block keeps popping up
Niggas hate me, they don't have a choice
Cause I'm shining the perfect moment
Niggas can't fuck with me, I'm like your ex bitch
I'm on that homicide trip or I die x shit
44 revolver wild wild west fuck
Niggas speaking recklessly are now on my wreck list
Bullets of death wishes hit your front front exit
Ya hollow heads just to shake heads
And if we see it there, we drop it there
I have a bullet with your name
I catch you sliding sunny day come and rain on it
You get a concrete pillow in the coffin for your bed
Got niggas looking for you like you got money in your head
I'll kill you when I catch you, I'll kill you
Many many men [?]
But fuck a vest, I got a tec on me
Fuck his chest, I hit his head, I hit his face and I hit his neck when I squeezed
Look, we really do this here
All shooters here
Thirty rounds in that four pound Ruger
Come here like you're gonna talk shit
Bullets hitting front to back
Doctors screaming clear and nigga flat line
Had been shot dead hit his chest came out the back
We murder and snatch boys
Take them to their hiding place
Search the facilities until you earn money
I'm alone, thirty shots on my chrome clip
I'm on your best little niggas is on
I know some live street niggas that I can phone
And shoot you a broad day in your dome
I have a bullet with your name
I catch you sliding sunny day come and rain on it
Niggas talking about that shit until we slide over them start teasing that shit
You get a concrete pillow in the coffin for your bed
Got niggas looking for you like you got money in your head
God yes)
Skinny nigga but I make it big like a 3X
The last nigga tried to hurt me, umm he checked
Back to that money throwing O on projects
Or probably catch the mileage while the pilot steers the P-Jet
Because we go on and flex like ...
90PX, working all night without breaks or recess
Vroom vroom yeah I know my car sounds like a T-Rex
Bitch, I'm 23 and I'm not in a Prius
My cousin finished school, I can't believe he graduated
He threw him $ 20,000, he said to his ass, congratulations
It causes me? I wasn't made for that shit
But I could probably hire him and who paid for his shit
And to all the hoes that were losing I beg God to see me
I'm on a yacht doing hella 'smoking those algae well
Bad bitch in her cha-cha clutching her chi-chi
Millions of dollar deals in my email, you're crazy as hell you're not in CC
Chain all the V.S., bitch, you know it's B.S.
Boy I run my city
End of story, nigga P.S.
You all niggas were loafing, members of the tough nights we caught
And they say that life is a chess game.
You can play checkers in my jacket
Because he's Damier and we bombard all rappers
I say yes, nigga, I kill that, Panamera turtle back
I give your bitch a spin on that board, she throws it
I hit myself in that pussy Blake Griffin'd you ho, nigga
That's because I do it, ho, I scream at my new ho
That pink pussy like Nuvo and I chase him; Cujo
Niggas wants to talk, what are they going to say? (I'm going to say)
I hit the pedal until that motherfucker broke (until he broke)
Weird bitches love the money I make
And to live like this, motherfuckers, you have to pay
So let that shit burn! Let that shit burn
I'm going to let that shit burn, let that shit burn (Burn, gasoline!)
The burning ceiling, I'm just getting higher
Drive until the wheels fall off and are towed
I've got green on top of green damn it looks like I'm growing it
Burn bitch, let it burn bitch
My money's more direct than a fucking permanent, bitch
Shorty, give me all that brain that still hasn't learned shit
Oh, is that your girl? Damn nigga, you don't learn shit
She naked in my studio, I'm in that Howard Stern shit
I swear that Mac 10 is my bar, finally famous the poster
Hit your girl on my whip and now that pussy has the smell of a new car
The same shit, a different day, I'm no longer broken, it's a different day
Don't turn me down, I got shit to say
My tummy strong like I'm lifting weights
My Rollie doesn't tick, your shit sounds like a time bomb
Boom! Little bitch
Niggas wants to talk, what are they going to say? (I'm going to say)
I hit the pedal until that motherfucker broke (until he broke)
Weird bitches love the money I make
And to live like this, motherfuckers, you have to pay
So let that shit burn! Let that shit burn
I'm going to let that shit burn, let that shit burn (burn, gasoline)
The burning ceiling, I'm just getting higher
50 shelves in my pocket, I want bottles, I'm going to let that shit burn
Let that shit burn
I'm going to let that shit burn, let that shit burn (burn, gasoline)
The burning ceiling, I'm just getting higher
50 shelves in my pocket, I want bottles, I'm going to let that shit burn
Uh, go get that paper so I can get what I want
Stopped in the back, I couldn't fit in the front
Now I pull back, my whip sits in front
Caught with the bastards, early gymnastics
I never had a teacher but I managed to master it
The art of getting money in a timely manner
You know we still ... we're still black, you know, niggas are playing
You have to see them, you have to see me man
When you see me you keep the same energy that you had
You know what I'm talking?
You have to see us. See what i say
And it could have gotten worse but, you know, these niggas are pussies
Shoot, just keep the same energy
Whenever you say something about any Dreamchaker, black, keep the same energy when you see us and the man.
Someone, we don't have elections here. Dreams are worth more than money.
Uh, give me some levels, go up
Uh, they say I talk too much money
But maybe because I saw too much money
I can't chase any woman regardless of touch money
So if it's not about paper, bring me all the dust
Young fools, the richest and most real nigga in my city
Yes if you don't come with your gun then go here
Because I'm the referee with the whistle, you're out of bounds here
And this time in my Sky-dweller it says "The crowns close"
Be a broker and trade something that is not there
I hardly sleep, I have million dollar nightmares
I'm here, finna, kill them, kill them all, shi-shi-trembling
At the end of the day, when I stayed, the first year I entered, pop stars entered
Wait, wait, I don't know, I said that the first year I entered, they arrived
Basic bitches can't sit with us
And none of these niggas ain't as rich as us
We swear that that money will never reach us
We swear these bitches will never reach us
And loyalty goes to the grave for this shit
All my niggas pay for this shit
Because we're already rich and you know I'm the shit
Got fifty niggas with me, got Rollies on my wrist
Uh, I want everything my niggas want, except the hoes that fuck
Who's there? Turn around worry if [?] Truckin '
It doesn't matter, you know how we rock, we hit
Look at my man's wrist there, you see it's shiny
21 and Berks, this is the complete set
My nigga Dean, I was catching the wreck
Turning corners on niggas, 50 on the Tec
(laughs) I can't ... I need a basic rhythm
Locin low and pulling pussy you were not there
Chained to our ankles, it was like a nightmare
Did you ever wash drawers with the same water you shit
Doing push-ups right on the floor where I meas
You gotta rumble with them overnight till morning and shit
(laughs) they can't get more of that
I saw a black man be killed by half a bird
On the head, the cat licked his brain off the sidewalk
To play in the six sixes, Julius served
And I don't have to put on a vest because I'm really good
And I should scream my connections, like I really should
Like Death Row and 9’5, Meek Milly I Suge
But I'm arrogant like Pac, ice hockey the clock
Mercedes green, butter brown be broccoli drop
‘Because winters were cold, broccoli meat was hot
We were selling them, still getting the attention of the police.
Praying that Daddy doesn't grow up to be like us
Praying to them, people don't judge us and try to live us
I did it for all my niggas, we're playing no, they don't want us
And they want to kill us, if they could one of the most real
But they can't find us in a forest looking at the Clippers like a Kingpin
I don't hate man, we want to see all of Philadelphia win
Am I saying already? As if we wanted to see when we left the city
A bunch of Philly niggas holding on too much, man
What part of Philly are you from man? Wear it for the whole city man, everyone
Get on, get off the guns and collect some money
(I'll take the mines and the money, yes, you know what I mean)
(I'm not mad at anything)
Man, are you ready?
Felt like I was committing perjury
Because this time they are talking here, it's not me
And next time I take my son to court so he can see
How they want to murder their dad, I murder the caddy
Should I turn left or right? ‘Because nothing was ever right
We are in love with the weapons of bustin and selling white
I remember Snupe's mom calling me from the scene
There is no life in his body, blood in his jeans
I couldn't believe it, one of the youngest of my regime.
I was killed and I feel like it's my fault
Or the name I brought you?
Man, a nigga puts on an affair, put a torch on it
And I put it on my son, I tried to talk to them
And tell them to stay away from the murder
R.I.P to my Lil nigga Snupe
Yeah that's how we rock, rock our Lil Snupe for life nigga
I was only 18 years old, just one that was a coupe
If you get a job, they laugh at you, kill something they greet
That's the only shit they see, that's the only shit they kill
Young mothers teaching their daughters to burst
Babies who have babies and they babies who have male babies
This shit seems crazy, even the birthday was maybe
Mommy playing the role of daddy, because he is behind a fence
And she told them that he was in school, because the children were on hold
Man, these clouds look gray from this view behind the store
Good girls selling pussy, she had to pay the rent
And these children need shelter, nobody help her
And who am I to judge her, the tears of a single mother?
And the only thing that scares her is that nobody listens to her
So the tears turn black when they touch the mask
Why do I treat my last meal like I treat my last sentence
Very grateful, because I already had shackles on my ankles.
Shackles on my wrist too, I swear that shit was painful
The reflection of your eyes through that photo
I could paint you, like Basquiat, feel a soul of fascia
Some recite the songs, the religious say that the fire burns
And I don't want to go to hell, but it's hell on Earth
If I can't pay God with this money, then tell me what it's worth
I say, I say, Said she wants a boss just to sweep her away
Hit it with the D and I can't keep it away from the meat
We're crawling all over the weekends, I'm talking all crazy in weeks
Because loyalty is royalty, hoes are not loyal
You are what you are and I loved you
I listened to you with a dancer, hoping I enjoy you
‘Because you were like a ticket with a drill in my pocket
All these hundred dollar bills in my pocket
She could give you gottens and she'll give you trouble
When I don't even try, blame your mom, bitch
Or blame it on jail, because you thought you were exploding
With your little followers (ha)
She thought she was showing up with her little followers, ha
What I do? Tell him to break them, and if a nigger fucks my bitch for free
What I do? Let them take her (You can keep that bitch)
‘Because I have so much money, what do I do? I could build them, I could make them
Tummy tuck and ass pounding, what do we do? Flying bitches to Jamaica
Dream buyer, nigga!
Talk to them!
Real niggas back in man style, Guns and butter man, D.C
Uh, uh, it's Osama, Twin Llama, from D.C. camp.
I heard you like to spread your mouth, are you the champion of the people?
All that shit is going to wet your shirt
A tag on your toe, black kitty that's the seal of D.C.

And you are who you are, who you are not here

Take that bitch out of her panties

Counterfeiters, counterfeiters, counterfeiters, counterfeiters
21, plat that [??]
It looks like a sandwich
I turn the bitch into a
Https://cgcamps.com/chuong-trinh/trai-he-singapore-corpgift-2020/
Start from the bottom when someone else does
Nigga, let me take my turn, they should never have waited
Now I'm a black hated forever
I cheat death nigga rest
I got hit just for ...
2 x hook:
Never in the ... call me never ...
Because I am a champion, because I am a champion
I came up with the plan .. in the building
You are ... and I have this feeling right now
Because I am a champion, are you a champion?
So say it to them because this is my life
This is my life, this is my life
This is your life, live life the last time
Because I am a champion and you are a champion
So say it with me, because this is my life
This is my life, this is my life

This is my life, this is my life
because I am a champion and you a champion
So say it to them because
Yeah uh
All the young men in my hood popping percs now
Getting high to pass, it's getting worse now
You have to tell them to put pistols and percussions
The new jails have ten yards in them and that's your first loss, huh
And I have not come here to preach
Youngin has a quarter of an ounce, tries to become a Meech
He hasn't had daddy, he had to learn from the streets
I used to be an honor student, damn
So I became a beast
The first time I saw a black man put some blood on his sneakers
I had Air Max 93s but I was slumped on the street
Your mom crying, that did something to me, oh Lord
He used to sell Reggie, damn, how do I get to Forbes?
I'm not going to quit smoking anymore, like give me a little more
We wore Old Navy, it felt like Christian Dior
He was dead in ruin but rich in soul, were we really that poor?
Were we really that dumb? Because we carry a gun
I'm talking to you like a prophet as weird as they come, huh
Gunshots sound like music hanging from the Buick
Why do you want to be a shooter?
Mom told me not to, but I did
Now i'm locked in a prison
Calling mom like "I shouldn't have done it"
See how my dream is broken in an instant
I'm visiting posin 'for the photo
Like I'm going to my prom or something
Ridin 'for these niggas like that shit doesn't hurt my mother or something
Only one will get me the commissary or even buy me something
When everything falls down
I can't call them all now
That won't take me home
Shit we were kids we used to play on the step
A couple of years later we flirted with the angel of death.
I was 11 years old, I put my hands on the TEC
When I first touched it, that shit rushed me
My friend is dying, I'm like "Maybe next"
That only made me a threat
Knowing that niggas smoke my dad, it pissed me off
He made me a fucking man I was five years old when God gave me my proof
I know that a young woman who was killed cannot drive any Wraith
But he in the hearse on the way to church, I know his mother will pass out
When it smells like embalming fluid, it colognes all over your baby
How can you blame me When I try to stay alive and survive and beat them when niggas die for twenty five
When I stop fearing for my life, when I decide to change my mind and stop totin '
Tryna smokes the pain, they lock us up for smoking
Victim of the system like a drop of rain in the ocean.
All schools close and all prisons open
Yes
See where I come from
We had to beat the streets
Beat the system, beat racism, beat poverty
And now we achieve everything that we in the championship
Counting all this money with my brothers
I have been counting all this money with my brothers.
Look at this at all these young niggas flexing from below
Flexing from below

She sees me go by a couple of mills like that
She wants to ride on it like a bus pass
Keep pushing, tack
Behind that ass, I'm in front of it
Leave him out of the park. Let these other niggas touch that
Turn up the music, where's the club?
Throw a couple of piles, where's the 1?
Shout out to all the women they know they have to come back
Girl you gotta see it straight on
She said, "Damn it, they'll be hating, where's the love?
I said, "Damn, you look like you do that."
Hair up, damn, she brought back the damn bun
Niggas shaded, damn, bring the sun back
Hit crazy, damn, bring the battery back

Talk about it being real when I know someone bought that
My time money and you niggas can't afford that
Bad bitches in the studio where I record that
Right now and finna I'm going down
Once this verse shit is over
I'm going to kill this pussy, I'm going to talk about it
Why are you dozing? I have a drink
I took her panties and put a pool on her
Uh look at me doe
Red backgrounds for models, never Aldo
Catch me, Maserati with the top down
And I get into that pussy, then I go out
Bad bitch and the low miles
She is a penny and she is a penny, so we don't know
When I compare them it's like a chevy, a tahoe

She said she had never seen a ghost until she was on my scrolls
Lookey here, I'll keep it real with you

You always in my heart, I will not forget you

You pressed on that nigga, what do your friends say?
I'm so happy that you don't listen to your friends, baby
You can tell me how you want it, how you need it, I don't care
And out of spite you came to decline, but I was exaggerated
I hit your line a few more times than you answered, I will respond
Tell me how you want it, yeah
Call me and I'm on my way (On my way, on my way, woah)

Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday
All day, 24/7
Yes, all day, 24/7.
Oh yeah
You'll be throwing that shit like it's a Thursday
They ain't fucking with you on your worst day
I have you on a new level like what Ferg says
When you fell, I pick you up
Put on your crown and it will lift you up
I put a stone on your finger, so much ice could push a disc
Speaking relationship goals, it could be us, yuh

Look, I have a milli 'in a hiding place for a wedding
If you are ready let me know because it is whatever

End
What i discovered
I made a vow that from now on
I will be the best i can
You fuck, you smoke
You fuck, you fuck, you fuck, you smoke
Uh, niggas know the rules in my neighborhood
If you touch me they'll kill you
We are not with it from one side to another, it is not rap, we hit first
G-5, we will be at LIV on Sunday when you are in church
Stressed mom, selling dinner plates
Try to get your coffin and funeral
Every nigga you see with me has ice on them, the bank takes us
Naw nigga, no 1 on 1, we don't fight fair, we just roll on 'em
We're not swinging any flags, nigga
We don't need a pass, nigga
Glock 40 with a clip of 30 and a laser, play with us
Everyone wants to talk about bricks
Until the feds rush in and grab niggas
Dream Chasers got into something
We never blink because we destroy niggas
Deen Buck still in the cut and the state fits to let Ernie out
I don't even have to say anything
About that other friend you've heard of
Because if he found out about that, you pass your mouth
He comes to your house and starts going out
Catch me N-Y-C, out Shadyville, I'm in the tank
It's only Manhattan when I'm in the cabin or on the bench
Summer in La Marina with Dominicans in the paint
Lifting up, screaming, "Hey, tell me?"
See you in brooklyn, get pita, pussy!
You fuck, you smoke
Nigga, you fuck, you smoke
You fuck, you fuck, you fuck, you smoke
(Yes! Ayy, Meek, what's up? Bang! Oh, man in Chiraq)
Niggas tell me and Sosa beefin '
But we both eat, but only one keeps
He told the law that he has been 15 years
I can't tweet Teyana, corporate nigga looking
So what I'm in, I have to keep it a secret
That face not Stevie no Mimi, I promise Teyana that I will not filter it
Grabbed all 30, just cashed
If you caught shooting, then you realized
I am the same black that my city asked about
Four birds in the trap like four wings at Harold's house
With french fries covered in soft sauce
Every time a black rap meat claps in a couple of weeks
Location in, we can go meet
Pop a wheelie in N-Y-C, got 30 with my nigga Flee
I heard Tyga sneak out saying to me tell 'em whores I'm not right
Tyga only has one name, but that nigga doesn't have a single stripe
The backpack, so easy to get the black shit
In Chiraq, don't come here
You're not from here? Do not come here
Why shorty snipin ', put a bag on it if you don't like this
30 hits like Tyson
Back to the rap stream, hot shit
Damn I gotta rap I got bricks
Every city I go has sticks
Wells Fargo pockets, no bricks
Let's say I'm upstairs now, no shit
You can never say that shit wife
I don't even like shit, I just shit shit, a fucking night
L.A. with killas and thugs
New York SlowBucks, they my brothers
A-T-L with Migos and Young Thugger
Let's shoot shit in public
And they want to drink
Chiraq, look at the murder rate
You wear red pants and Phillip Lim
Everyone tries to get hold of him
Bad bitches that will be at Benz
I knock them down like bowling pins
Real nigga on 4nem
Young Boss, the new Soulja Slim
Coming out of the tank with Slow and them
Come take a trip to D.C.
I'm the big dog, I'm ringing
Like the 3-piece Mambo sauce
"Glizzy, why aren't you D.C.?"
Who said I'm not D.C.?
Fuck you bitch to my CD
She let me record her as Mimi
A nigga playing, the light goes out
Ooh, the shine has me frozen
I can't wait until it works out
Tell Chino to take out the bikes
I have 50 weapons in my trap house
You better fuck with the White House
I'm the most real fucking young man in the world
I have a lot of money, I have a lot of girls
And everyone wants to go take a fucking whirl
Did she come to us with the marble pearls?
357, that bitch just spins
Make him catch our shit like Fitzgerald
You fuck, you smoke
You fuck, you fuck, you fuck, you smoke
You fuck, you fuck, you fuck, you smoke
Court! It's hot outside man
Meek Millys is coming daddy
A hundred for the tutorial, I'm not the one you're talking to
Drive and get wet, nigga, that's a ride
Spitting out all this hot shit, every bar is great
Diamonds on rollie face, animated cartoon
I put my diaper braids in front of the Maybach clique
Riding on the wheels of fortune, the shit of Pat Sajak
And all I rock is Balmain like I did that shit
I've been to front row fashion week like I'm on the show
Sitting outside, leather softer than a bun
Make a movie about your bitch, tell her friend to take a role
You thought I was innocent, we laugh like it was a ho
Taking out the Benzos, meet your bitch in the friend zone
She told you that they made me friends, what? I'm in the final zone
Touchdown with a 2 point conversion, give it that long dick
She busts like the long clip, Uber to send your bitch home, nigga
I have a bitch fever
It's hot outside, I have a fucking fever
Feeling sick, I got a fucking fever
In these streets of Philadelphia the situation is
The police do not respect young people and
Youth do not respect the truth and
The Glock 9 is on me in the cabin and
All I talk about is that real shit, the truth and
Money turned your bitch into a gold digger
Money made me feel like old Jigga
And Jigga even told me you're a cold nigga
And I told niggas that I'd expose niggas
I went to buy a pair of sneaks, I landed at the Royce dealership
You can ask your baby mom, I'm the steering wheel of her baby dad
Looking at my neck, how much does it cost? One hundred and eighty in cash
We used to sell rock before Kareem Biggs, Damon Dash
Oh, do you think you fly with your little lil 'Dream Chasin'?
We don't chase bitches, we chase money and that D'ussé
Riding on a fallen head, Phantom with the toupee
And if you're just listening to this, then it's probably too late
I have a bitch fever
Feeling sick, I got a fucking fever
In these streets of Philadelphia the situation is
Youth do not respect the truth and
The Glock 9 on me in the cabin and
All I talk about is that real shit, the truth and
Meek Milly, Mack Milly
Get a silly slap, come to Philly
Come see it live
Stop playing black
It's DC, double MG
Boy, I swear to God, I make her fuck the whole clique
Camarilla, clique, clique, clique
Sitting in the back while she sucks my dick
Boy I got a hundred cash here on my wrist
It started from below, now a nigga is getting rich
I'm not looking at your bitchass
I'm looking at your bitch's butt
I fuck a famous ho and put that cock in his rich ass
And every time I'm shooting, there are 200 hundreds in the [?]
She tells all her friends now, those bitches act curious
And when the police ask them, they tell them how Siri did it
Get it, iPhone, face time
I had your bitch last night, we had a great time
My flow is so crazy, check the way I travel at the base hard
Wait nigga come in, these niggas ain't got no win
The baddest bitches I'm with seem to be modeling
The advantages and the pattern made me drug like a goblin
Crazy rappers making diss records I'd like to try again
Please nigga, you should knee down nigga
As in September, thanking my dad, I am the next Simba.
Meek Milly, bitch
I'm not looking at you bitches, cause I don't feel any of you bitches
I'm not checking up on you niggas, I'm not worried about you niggas
And my shit is something important, like I'm looking for the numbers
I have 2 chains around my neck, you can see I do it differently
She's so bad but she's leaving so, but the shit turned real when I got that ball
Too much 3d, but you can't see me
Shit gets bad, and you know I did it for the win
And yeah, I killed this check, but fuck that shit, I'll do it again
Do it again just to quench your thirst
If you dive put your face first
And when I spit out that shit they like, I turn pure [?]
And then they see that body, they see that ass, that ridiculous shit
If you want meat first, you gotta get through my fucking team
That's for all of you lame see nasty
Name a girl who can fuck with me
Wait, oh wait, I say, name the girl who fucks with me
If you talk shit just be careful what comes out of your mouth
Scent something erotic, make your boyfriend pay to smell it
Or try it, put your face on
He likes that we fuck your government that incredible shit
Yes, I'm talking about Lee, Lil 'Chino and Lil' Snup-e
Murder on every clue, preferred Jahlil B
I'm also talking about Rozay, we respond with MMG
Sailing South Beach in a California Ferarri
Glitter brighter than California, my jewelry is extra eye-catching
Look at the way I maneuver, she says I'm soft as a barbie
Man I'm living life, could I do that tonight
I found them bottles of roses, the waitress put them on ice
Shine everything in my section, man, I could give you a light
We spend money fast like we never saw paper
Now I have these new relatives, and they all call
Suddenly this shit started James Harden
I tell them to talk about some money but they are not talking
But I'm going to look for him until they put me in the coffin
It's funny now that they call me shit
Louie V, DC, fucking man, and no one is fucking with my clique
I never had a role model
I was loading gold holes in my little Glock-40
And I think it was December when they invaded me
Niggas is jealous, dammit, can you tell us?
Are you trying to sell us with those dreams? That's probably why I'm a rebel
For a fraudulent nigga, I lost niggas when I got paper
It's like I made more money, they got fake
And it's crazy when your best friend becomes your main enemy
I wanna roll over you and smoke like top paper
Damn, what a feeling when you and your friend get cold
And you know he had thoughts of probably stealing and killing you
Mama said never, never let them look down on you
Last year was like a bad year
Although I touched more paper than a cashier
Small circle, I'm never really 'square squares
They say there's levels in this shit, niggas down
Different floors for different bulls.
Different tours on different planes, my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror, Meek Milly, is this your car?
Look at your arm, look at your neck, look at your charm
And to think that my niggas started cooking raw
When it was difficult, the coach told me to take the ball
I step back for all three, I see it shake and fall
We were down for three and they thought we had lost
They couldn't beat me like Earl Boykins, I'm getting soft
I tried to say goodbye like Champ Bailey but I'm Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown, now what?
Golden AP all destroyed, fuck clowns
I think my heart gets cold, my heart gets cold
I told them I would do it someday, only God knows
When Diddy, Hova and Baby talk, I'm listening
When I'm in the jungle, the devil whispers
The slugs that fly next to me I hear them, they whistle
That was close
Stand up nigga so I don't fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
I saw him last week, he was my driver, he was like "I told everyone"
Mommy was a booster, Dad was a shooter
Looking at my friends, I see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
If I don't understand, it will probably end with a helicopter
I told my mom that I won't let these enemies kill me
Drug me even though I might get derailed
And I'll never let these bitches see me for real, do you feel me?
Times change like Rollie did
Now I'm killing these niggas like Kobe did
Ayo, it ruins when your own family starts calling you
Shit, money is the root of all evil
The family starts telling you "you act different black"
You are absolutely right, I am acting different
But when it comes from your brother, your sister
Your mother, your father, that shit hurts the central man
When they start acting like something you've never seen before
You grew up motherfucker
They raised you, you finished playing in the park with them
This money thing, this shit will fuck you up man
You have to see what you ask for
Are you sure you want this son? Are you sure you want this money?
Are you sure you want this fame? Are you sure you want this power?
Yes, everyone wants it, everyone needs it, motherfuckers for money
Getting money doesn't stop but I'm not mad at them
Shit, but shit, even bosses have feelings, you know?
Don't let this money depress us
Shit, everyone eats B, everyone eats, everyone eats
Come on hahaha
Oh yeah
And the streets all night like we have nowhere to live
I remember on Sundays we have nothing but Liv
Thirty thousand was the account and you have nothing to give
I'm not traveling, I'm not traveling, I pour bottles, I'm not drinking
I let the niggas shine, you still acting like shit?
Let them have little hoes, they were all on my dick
Twenty chains, eight watches, they don't fit on my wrist
When I talk about those things, I never said it was my shit
I said it's our nigga and when you're ready let's dance nigga
But I know exactly what I saw nigga
He was envious, you looked askance and I remembered
The reason my heart is cold now in December shit
Speaking of the twenty-fifth, in fact, the twenty-sixth
Maybe it's the twenty-eighth, dammit though my money's straight
While daddy smiled
I will be in airplane mode faster than a pilot
I've seen it, I've seen it
And I was surprised man, I don't want to believe it
But if nigga I've seen it
My heart grows cold and the streets grow cold
I think my heart gets cold, my heart gets cold
I told them I would do it someday, only God knows
Woah, no, honey, hey
It won't matter, darling
You do not know
You do not know
It won't matter, darling
You do not know
Uh, get out of the neighborhood, they tell you Hollywood
How dare you, niggas, tell me I got it right?
Gotta check up and treat these niggas like I'm Robin Hood
And I was looking at you niggas, all the ones I fed
It made me grind all those nights when you went to bed
And if you think I owe you something, nigga is ahead
I treat you like I never met you, put it on your head
And I got Papi to my line like, 'When are you coming home?'
My mom sees it in my face, she knows something is wrong
Bodies falling in my city all summer
Out on bail, but I still have to follow something
Because I can't let them take my life, you could stay, do that well
When he left, he wasn't okay, but he was trying to live that life
I call Coon to book that plane, we like three deep ones, we take that flight
We used to land in California to play that studio all night, we stayed down
For the love of them millions, he is not lying down
I left you in the hood, what do you say now?
And the niggas wanted to smoke, you said "Get away", huh
Cold heart, never have cold feet when the pressure comes
It was beef, I had to tell the blacks, "You better come."
The sister said they were leaving, it's like you left them
Some things I had to learn my lesson from, huh
Register, log out, I just had to check you out
2012, it was 50 niggas when I go out
I forgot the time you asked me for a check and I didn't lend it
I don't even know you were upset, is that what this shit is about?
When you can't mention once, you returned a favor
Cause I know the signs when niggas switch sides, they catch the fumes
Used to be my friend, you were on my left titty
And when I copied 6, you wanted 550
Scream: "Ride or die", I thought you would travel with me
I found out you were jealous, you wouldn't even bother me
And when I copied 6, you wanted 550
What am I supposed to spend a thousand nights in the studio turning off my lights?
They give my money to a nigga, then they act like he's with me
I've never been sweet
As far as I can remember, every time I went to jail I had to stand alone on that bitch.
Look, it hurt my heart to see some of my closest friends turn their back on me for that attention needle
Or a green piece of paper with a slave master in front of that shit
I used to hear niggas, niggas I was feeding, I heard them whisper, "Meek Mill is over"
I thought "And damn, I was feeding you, brother"
All I did was keep grinding
For the love of millions, royalty over loyalty, never mistake it
I have a friend who is making life: he cannot offer me any money, he cannot offer me anything more than a friendship and a relationship
I talk to him seven days a week
So if you feel some kind of way regarding my money, we will go as far as possible to protect that plate that is in front of my son on the table, black
While I had to sacrifice and put everything on the line
Once for my mother and sister who never changed me, even before I had money
Ride or die, whatever happens
Buyers of dreams for life, do you dig?
If you don't see them in the photos with me, that means they faded
I got niggas that I distanced myself from, we love each other, everything is love, but not everyone can do it
Niggas wants to burn a bridge and expect me to send a yacht, huh? Where do they do that?
I'm screaming for free my black tip
He brought it from Atlanta to Philadelphia, Mike Vick
Prosecutors say they could stay
I was praying to God, man doesn't make me like this
The girls fucking niggas with the bricks
Now they explode me, I laugh, you dirty bitch
Dirty money new job
It smells on my new shirt
Lying makes these suckas feel good, but the truth hurts
Many niggas mess, get it in return
But enough dirt has you sitting with the worms
Hollow tips fucking your head like a cut bowl
When my homies roll, they're like holding on
I'm not talking, tell them to light 'em up like a hard wrap
Rather make these suckas bend like a blunt
Turn them like a Backwood, a black hood placed in black
Dicked down ski'd up
Hoes Down G's Up
I couldn't get Gucci, but I could get an Oozie
Spray your hood and hit your neighbors just for being curious
You niggas on that silly shit
My niggas gave them birds and they came looking for a thigh
I'm cooked crack to the [?]
All this rap made me shine like tin foil
Your niggas ain't loyal
Money, envy and greed will destroy you
All about a dollar sign
And I'm hotter than these fools like a thousand times
Yes gang
Hunters, hunters, hunters, hunters, gangs
Ayy
32 deep so it doesn't matter who you get (no way)
All my niggas hit, no matter who you're with (alright)
We will hit you if you say it, it doesn't matter if you tease
You already said it in your friend, you are a pussy (you are a pussy)
In the kitchen with Pyrex, baking cookies (cooking)
Folding that Bentley truck, they couldn't miss me
Yeah bitch I'm talking fifty
If I defend my money, they can never overlook me
White comes straight from 'crossing the border, you can never overcook it
I change it to Blake Griffin, they're going to hit that shit on all of you
I told my brother to bring his punch, we will hang it on the wall
They've been waiting in that ring to get that thing out and cut it
Link to the connection and we collect the blocks (that white parakeet)
Running to a pussy and picking up her watch
When we catch it, headshot, unplug its top, wow!
Let's talk about the trap, let's talk about the streets (What's wrong?)
You looked at Jordan, we looked at Meech (Meech)
Clean a black block, leave that bitch bleached (brrrt!)
What kind of boss are you? You gave your daughter a Draco (Draco, Draco)
Royal bosses put their dawgs on the payroll (payroll, payroll)
Drop Rolls Royce, that's a nigga (don nigga)
I got pumpkin seats, bitches orange, black (Hermes)
We CMG grizzly, we just sold the forum
Yes, press a button on that new gift and see how it transforms (transforms)
You think you can disrespect the king and hate doesn't hurt
Quarter milly on the diamond chain, no charm
Milly Rockin 'in the kitchen, trying to get it to form (fuck it, fuck it)
And my tradition sends the money, they soon said it was a bonus
Link to the connection and we collect the blocks (that white parakeet)
Running to a pussy and picking up her watch
When we catch it, headshot, unplug its top, wow!
I got all these diamonds, bitches say I look possessed
You are afraid of violence, so you have to cut the check
We always design for my niggas to die fresh
No need for wallets, ball shitting in my fist
Take out the projects, that's the first one on the list (mom)
Pack your bags, mom, your little son sucks (mom)
We are accusing blacks and then we hit them with the bombardment
Speaking silently, it's okay to speak in code
It's still lil 'Boobie Boys and I gotta yell at the zoes
We are one of one, therefore I made custom clothing
I have the dome set in D and the hem
I still fly commercial but I don't do TV shows
Fucking an actress so she has to play the part
Versace diners on a Donatella toast
Black in a 'Vetty, IG pulled out, viewing the post
They gave him life to live life, that boy was salsa
Who are you going to? Pussy, go get a body bag
Still ready for war, never run with rats
Again, drug addicts running rap
Connect the dots, connect the dots
Link to the connection and we collect the blocks (that white parakeet)
When we catch it, headshot, unplug its top, wow!
Look what it is, they don't know a rock of a diamond
I'm like hol 'up, hol' up, hol 'up, hol' up
Hol 'up, hol' up, hol 'up, hol' up
Hol 'up, hol' up, hol 'up, hol' up
Wait a minute motherfucker
Tell your bitch "Fall back, nigga" (for what), we don't have room (no way)
And your bitch ain't bad (No), nigga, you ain't got no flavor (Whoa)
And everyone wants to be king, as if the deck had no Ace
Half of my bitches are richer than me
Hoes you pay I'm hitting free
You pay that just to give it some D
Damn, damn
I'm with a white bitch named Roxanne
Because that contagious shit (Woo), these outrageous niggas
It started buzzing like locators
Wake up like, "Where are my neighbors?"
Prolly in Vegas (Vegas), throwing dice on the table
The feds look at me like cable
Do me a favor, don't do me favors
A favor can be very contagious
Migo and Meek Milly have batteries on the roof
I have ties of money to Philly
I'm fucking your bitch and she from Puerto Rico
The plug is a daddy, he sent me the kilo
I get on the plane and then I fly to Las Vegas
Liaison with the mafia in Reno
And I get McLaren out, I get off the toe Giuseppe
I'm in the kitchen cooking antidote (I'm cooking it)
Looking down on a fucking nigga
Because a young black man with superior ropes
Now everyone wants to take a picture (Huh)
Now that young black man is worth seven figures (Woo)
Get out of that vault and I'm counting millions
Thanking the Lord for the M&M
Because that shit is contagious, these outrageous niggas
It started buzzing like locators
Now I have paper, just look at these acres
Wake up like, "Where are my neighbors?"
Prolly in Las Vegas (Woo), throwing dice on the table
The feds look at me like cable
Do me a favor, don't do me favors
A favor can be very contagious (Offset)
My friend, my guy, go see my biography
I have bricks coming from Ohio
I'm in North Philly, I meet Meek Milly (Meek Milly)
We try to make millies to catch the chicken
You run me, you need Geico insurance
I run to the money, I have a lot of resistance
I buy abroad and you buy in liquidation
I ran 500K for my looks (Woo)
Offset a magician at work, I'm a magician
Smoking hard for niggas to hear me (gangs, gangs)
Thanking the Lord while I count the blue Benjamins (Thank you)
Drinking on Actavis, I don't need a hunter
QC is the label, we fuck with Dreamchasers
My niggas act foolish, but this ain't actin '
Money, run my generation (Uh)
Because that shit is contagious, these outrageous niggas
Wake up like, "Where are my neighbors?"
Prolly in Vegas (Vegas), throwing dice on the table
Do me a favor, don't do me favors
A favor can be very contagious (Woo)
Mason Margeilla, I have dope on the tip of my toe
He got rich with a pot and the stove
Cappin 'trap out the side's back door
My plug is a friend, get in the banana pot
F&N splits your head like a melon
Paparazzi flashin ', get that Camaro out (Paparazzi)
Damn, I mean camera, white girl from Canada
No, I'm not Tommy Lee, but I have Pamela
Lighting the block like Christmas candles
OG gas bag on my back like I'm Santa
Throwing four into the one-liter Fanta
Started bustin 'as a pager
Now I have paper, just look at these acres
Wake up like, "Where are my neighbors?"
Prolly in Las Vegas, throwing dice on the table
The feds look at me like cable
A favor can be very contagious (Woo)

About that money and about that cream (hey, hey, hey)
I'm about to swim, I am, I'm on cream
I'm about to get dollar signs, where's that brown bag?
For that bread I will be in your house like
I go deaf if it's not about dough
Offshore Royal Oak, I have diamonds on them
It came out hard, handle the food in the fridge
Now these enemies can't breathe they need a respirator
Women whistle me every time they see me
Drinking DP on my way to DC
Ask the niggas in Florida who know me well
Fuck the shit baby, I'm on mine
Champagne in the air, it's time
I'm about to cream, I'm, I'm about to cream (about that)

Money on my mind, pussy on my radar
Bitch, pay me, I'm on my Bernie Madoff
Money talks, shit goes, cut your legs
Aim for your egg, turn that shit into eggnog
And if I fall, my money is my cushion
Niggas can't see me like they're not looking
To the red flag, a pledge of loyalty
All bitches don't want meat like vegans
Maino, what's going on? Hard black hustle
This that money train, all aboard nigga
I'm about to cream, I'm, I'm about to cream (about that)
About that money and about that cream (hey, hey, hey)
I'm about to swim, I am, I'm on cream

I'm over the bad bitches it's over the head
I'm about to ride past the Benz
We get money like we've never heard of the feds
The black Bentley Coupe rolling like the Batmobile
I'm on baby, I'm on cake
Press the button on the doors to get closer to the face
What is Mommy Poppin? Now i'm getting money
I'm from Brooklyn but now they want me in Houston
Say "hello" to life, goodbye to my bankruptcy days
I'm about to swim, I am, I'm on cream
About that money and about that cream (hey, hey, hey)
I'm about to cream, I'm, I'm about to cream (about that)
I'm about to swim, I am, I'm on cream
About that money and about that cream (hey, hey, hey)
I'm about to swim, I am, I'm on cream
I'm already doomed
My whole life has changed
I lost every job, I lost everything, every opportunity I can get
I can't buy cars, I can't rent, I can't get any of it
But I'm still a survivor, you know, I'm still going to court
I'm still smiling, I'm still signing autographs, but I'm going to go crazy soon!
America eats its babies, we, I am
It doesn't matter what they think of me
You can't just turn me off like this
Huh Huh Huh
2Pac back, 2Pac back
Those are all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better imagine me rolling
Buying new tires, but bitches are stolen
Stranded on death row, Brenda bearing my baby
But I'm stacking my paper, I need a new Mercedes
They scream "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
Those are all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
Ugh! 2Pac back, I'm two Glocks tied
Filming in Philadelphia, this is the new Iraq (Philly!)
I am drinking Hennessy!
Riding on my damn enemies!
Slipping down my back, I'm yelling "MMG!" (Maybach music)
10 bitches and ten cents so it's Tennessee
A nigga plays with my money, my shooters lift his soul
Bitch, I'm like John Wall, cause I just give 'em and go
Pockets seem to be pregnant because bitches are swollen
I have a clip I can borrow, all those snitches could hold them
Look at them, you fucking wheels! Bitches are stolen
They scream
2Pac back, 2Pac back
Those are all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
But I'm stacking my paper, I need a new Mercedes
Speaking of death row records, tell them to bring me a chair
Let it burn, I'm screaming, "Free my nigger, listen!"
I got my Makaveli CD and then heard what I learned
I grabbed my Mac over the dresser, my OG said "Hold it steady"
I'm dreaming to spit with Pac (Pac!) And encrypt with B.I.G (B.I.G!)
It made me scrape my wax, sleep, my knife on the bed
They have a black point like it's a price on my head
I'm leaving max! He made me hit fools and they came back
In these cells, raising hell, try to return to the trap
But never twist it, it's Meek Mill, we spit facts (Meek Milly!)
Also, someone said they saw it and they mean it
Then they keep screaming
2Pac back, 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better imagine me rolling
Buying new tires, but bitches are stolen
But I'm stacking my paper, I need a new Mercedes
They scream "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
Those are all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
Music M-M-M-Maybach
Right now sound
Hitmaka!
You feel the environment, it's contagious
Look you in the eye, shit is dangerous
Thankful I had all the patience
I know you're going through some changes
Ooh no we're not perfect but we're so close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
I really want to be here
I really wanna take you there (you there, oh there)
When are nights like this
I really want to be here (be here)
I really wanna take you there (you, baby, yeah, yeah)
Uh, it was nights like this, feeling good like this
I never really had a time like this, huh?
The second time in the crib knowing I couldn't hit
You said, "How do I look?" Like my bitch yeah
Look you in the eye, shit is dangerous
Wet pussy, I call it angel dust
I put so many diamond chains on you that they got tangled
I never felt this way, it's weird like shit (that's what loving you is)
I got your ex nigga calling, but he can't do much
Because now you're with the boy, Ella Mai, booed
And all you have to do is call and see Wraith stop
Under the stars as they cast all that shadow on us
Facts, woo!
You feel the environment, it's contagious
I know you're going through some changes
You are taking photos, you know your angles
Ooh no we're not perfect but we're so close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what loving you is
Uh, you feel the vibe, uh, I'm deep down, yeah
You're fucking with me, ooh, I let you ride, yeah
At first you curved me, I let you in
So curvy hips, you let me in
Ooh, and it was over once I turned you
Relationship goal when we arrive as Beyoncé, Hova
This is Hermes money, this is not Fashion Nova
You said your ex depressed you and I'm glad it's over
Cause now you're rockin 'with a real one
And when I hit him on the back, you still make me run
That's facts
You feel the environment, it's contagious
Look in your eyes, shit is dangerous (your eyes)
Thankful I had all the patience
I know you're going through some changes
You are taking photos, you know your angles
Ooh no we're not perfect but we're so close
That's what loving you is
Ayy, you know you're bad baby
Just give me all that pussy, so many options (so many options)
Girl, you got me calling, all these different numbers
Why are you selfish? You know I love you
You will leave work and you deserve a Birkin
Girl you're so contagious damn that dangerous shit
Look in your eyes, shit is dangerous
Thankful I had all the patience
I know you're going through some changes
You are taking photos, you know your angles
Ooh no we're not perfect but we're so close
Ooh, you give me something I can't pay for
That's what loving you is

MMG in the building
Give me money bitch
Yes Philly
If they are not talking about money, I do not hear them
If they're not talking pussy, I can't hear them hoes
I'm a paper maker, the pussy turns animal
More money more problems
So every check I get I buy more choppas
So every check I get I buy more choppas
Hunnid stacks, that's featherweight
Time to get this money and direct registration
Fuck the noisy ho, I never hate
On the first night, I never wait
I buy your fabric and red backgrounds
I'm in the hood where the leader explodes
While you were buying circles, we were copying
Thirty-six, Pyrex
Bakin Soda, I do a stretch of nine
Paper towel, let it dry, yeah
I have them looking at my wrist like "Already signed?"
No nigga, you're a ho nigga
Rapper, you're a G.I Joe nigga action figure
In the middle of the streets I'm in a 4-wheela
The same night I rock the same stages as HOV nigga
Ha!
If they are not talking about money, I do not hear them
I'm a paper maker, the pussy turns animal
More money more problems
So every check I get I'm buying more choppas
So every check I get I'm buying more choppas
I say, I'm going to the kitchen
Pitchin 'apron and a mitten
Trying to get it back, a nigga trying to get it back
Go ahead, go ahead with a [?]
Trying to burn it all down and bring it back
Know this shit done when it falls in the pot
For the right price I can drop it
The correct price drop is long overdue
I don't like mine to look like popcorn
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
Oh Lord!
Hundreds of mules got more diamonds than a jeweler
Nigga down to make you, I'm not fucking with a curl bar
Nickel plated Ruger has you in a box in Worldstar
Black duck, black duck, black duck
Court side sports center, I can make you a believer
They all go bankrupt, keep it real, you gotta fight
Hundreds of kilos in the beemer, boy don't make me get excited
A couple of mili around my neck like I'm trying to be charged
I have a mansion, I have a yacht, a bad bitch and a tiger
Real niggas, taking over televisions
Dope boys riding on a new set of Benzes
Hot boy, young boy, still on fire
What is a death sentence because we all have to die?
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
Oh Lord!
Sitting on them, now the shit is going crazy
Diesel brick made my hood look like it was Thrilla '
Just to let my niggas hold on when they roll, I could kill them
And these suckas, I don't feel them
I don't even see them
I am a dead fly, rest in peace Aaliyah
Half of my dawgz is dead, the rest is here.
I said I did it for my dawgz, I did it for my dawgz
I started with a Bonnie now I'm sitting in a Porsche
With the shooters right behind me
Shit, you're looking at a boss
Leather Basketball at Benz, Spalding
You all niggas talking, dammit, are you late?
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
Oh Lord!
Did it for them niggas with a vision like a boss
They did it for them niggas in the kitchen with the salt
Now I'm on that white thing, 500 horses for my niggas in the coffin
But I have bikes in my hand and a Rolly fallen head
Looking at the ceiling when I get up in the morning
My daughter making life, try to see it before it hits the coffin
Play with my newspaper, run in your offices
It's the 'o twelve nigga from Ice Cube with the Raider hat
A black maniac where the newspaper in
Highway to life, needs a hundred mills outlet
50 on the wrist, one hundred on the necklace, Montana!
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz
Oh Lord!
Look who you drink with
Look who you smoke with
If I put 7 on your face, will I open it?
And I know that tomorrow is not promised, but I hope it is
I love to meet you
Stay and destroy the jail
I did it for my friend so I had to pay bail
Get them out of the way, so I haven't raised the scales
Treat you like a hole, cut your ears and your tail
Choppas still hot, you can hold it yourself
Versace, same buckle on loafers and belt
Yes, the pills are flying, but smokers are something else
The crowd made them bring women
Obviously the flow made them scream for the lord
If you have money in your head, what do you think the reward is?
I don't do it by myself, do you know who I did it for?
I did it for my dawgz
Oh Lord!
I said I'm cooler than a cool fanatic like it's Easter
Heser thought that's what everyone says skeezers
I just fucked her yesterday friend, you can stay with her
Believe it, I do nothing, I am a ball
I'm a standing black
I jump every time I fall
Every time I lost I came back like the cook's crack
I have my hand in the game and I never look back
I said I'm fine I'm a hood I wish a nigga
Try to take me for a jerk, they hit him just because
I can't shake them for nothing, they hate but for what
When I do, they will be like UHH!
Because you are an insect, you run away and I am a G
I'm not a scoundrel, I'm not blood
But I don't bend, I don't move
I keep that semi by my insides
I let that sig explode
I say I don't have that haze
You know i have that kush
Niggas rolling on that land, smoking that Reggie Bush
They said they always say my name
But when they see me they never look
Because they know that I keep that flame
Goonies over there, and that doesn't even count for the tools they use
E.A. won't open, crash and fall
Over here in North Philly
They stop, hammer and explode
Put you in your dyin bed
I leave you in that lead dying
Break your head with that bread
A black bet does not dare to try it
I'm a damn gangster
Spank you with that banger
Soak yourself in that toaster
You heterosexual niggas cho-cha
Get wet and sticky
I'm picking on some newbies
My top drop ridin
And my Glock cock riding
And I'm hanging out that window and I won't stop shooting
Until a nigga on the ground and he contracts
His mother Fillin informs the boy that she misses
These niggas tell lies that they have never sold a dove
I just got to North Philly
And ask about that boy Gillie (They'll tell you he's a gangster)
I'm oschino
You know I have that fish if you try to find Nemo
If you try to burn me like that bitch, Yolanda does niggas making holes
Gucci pictures shade my vision
She on my dick like circumcision
Fuck that bitch let's get money
I fight my green in God, I trust
And I trust that I move and the coupes that I drop
Hottest on da block
Like when a policeman appears
Standing tall like the town hall
Rich, I can't fuck with you
Meek in your bag nigga I'm on da broad
My young bulls applaud like applause
Be on your butt like polo giveaways
Gettin dollaz go-go bars
Why do you think we are going so hard?
Hustle, rest, projects
Kill, shoot, loot
Us a mess
Burn it black, correct
Go to war with the ATF
I do my thang, you have no red stripes on your kicks
I do my job, you don't have Audemar on your wrist
I do my thang, you don't walk with batteries on the deck
Looking more steering wheel than a pilot, put your diamonds on your neck
I do my thang, you have no red stripes on your kicks
I do my job, you don't have Audemar on your wrist
I do my thang!
Gucci hat for Gucci sneakers
Gucci watch on Gucci belt
Use a lot of Gucci because it makes the bitch's coochi melt
Ghost door, suicide like that shit will go off
Diamonds diamonds on my chain
Dollars on my mind
Play the cut like iodine
Oh Schi nigga you know me
I've been an og, I've been getting handsome
All the money does not fit in any Timberland
I won't stop until I copy a house as big as your project block
Also, I like to buy a lot, so I have to get this handsome
I think I'm going blind because all I see is just a dollar sign
Dollar sign, dollar sign, dollar sign, dollar sign, dollar signs
I do my thang, you have no red stripes on your kicks
Looking more steering wheel than a pilot, put your diamonds on your neck
I do my thang, you have no red stripes on your kicks
I do my thang, you don't walk with batteries on the deck
I do my thang!
Ask your hoe about me she knows my name
And she informs me that I call her Lois Lane
And I'm his Superman, I'm not saying what coupe I'm in
I rush into an improved Benz
Twenty two dark tires, what you do nothing
Blowing that kryptonite, I'm going to feel like they get up tonight
If she doesn't suck my dick, I just tell that bitch to get well
You have no red stripes on your kicks
To them diamonds seem like a red light to a bitch
Make it stop, freeze, and everything is ready
We got that purple color per pound, we got all that work for that OR
You know, this ball gon 'audemar the way it glows
I keep them in my pocket and that's it for your hoe
Now let's go, that's when she stays
When the camera action is light
Pussy so wet and slippery I need traction
I do my thang, you have no red stripes on your kicks
I do my job, you don't have Audemar on your wrist
I do my thang, you don't walk with batteries on the deck
Looking more steering wheel than a pilot, put your diamonds on your neck
I do my thang, you have no red stripes on your kicks
I do my thang, you don't walk with batteries on the deck
Looking more steering wheel than a pilot, put your diamonds on your neck
I do my thang!
Drop top, flip flop, big knot, Chris pop
Broke is just a joke and I don't feel like Chris Rock
Clock like a wristwatch that Lambo makes a bitch stop
She'll be hypnotized, hypnotized like it's Big Pop
Like your Big Pop, well I'm like Shakur
She says I'm softer than velvet
As much as it catches me and lasts as I go
Bitches I fucked up and the money I turned
I do my thang you know
You know, I am my black Oschi
I'm discouraged, he'll be double G'ed
That's why your bitch has been fucking him and me
Now i don't know what they told you
But the money too thick that shit doesn't bend
My flow is hot, my wrist is cold
Money in [?] Is all we know
We do our work that you don't know, you don't know
I do my thang!
These hoes are insignificant
That is why we are not going to wait for them
These young niggas are smarter
And don't let yourself get caught
I say that Shawty has a husband
But she crawling out
These young niggas are smarter
And don't let yourself get caught
Don't do it [x3] (noooooo) (don't do it black)
Just 'cause he's okay with the ass, man, he just wants a nigga with cash
She playing
Shawty has a man but she crawls oooh
I guess he wants a young black man to eat it
But I was never known to keep a ho
I met her at Mia, I was with my nigga Tre a week ago
In fact, he said he ate two weeks earlier.
She said she won't fuck in months, I'm like you cunning
But I change them bitches like my sneakers
Fucking all my friends, she was trying to keep a secret
Loving the crew, I love the place for the team
She sucks my dick, I guess she's chasing that dream
That is why we are not going to wait for them
These young niggas are smarter
And don't let yourself get caught
I say that Shawty has a husband
These young niggas are smarter
And don't let yourself get caught
Don't do it [x3] (noooooo)
Just 'cause he's okay with the ass, man, he just wants a nigga with cash
She playing
She looks good but to me she's just a dumb bitch
Tryna falls in love because she knows I'm rich
Hear my name ringing, she knows I'm on my tip
2008 came in this game and I've done a good check
I'm a fool, fucking with those who did it
One thing they knew about the hustle, don't save a bitch
Basic bitch that we turn you with that you will sleep with
Her pussy was played, they call it Avirex
O-B-G-Y-N she gave birth to you with
You maybe baby cause you're weak and you're chasing your nigga nigga
These hoes are insignificant
That is why we are not going to wait for them
These young niggas are smarter
And don't let yourself get caught
I say that Shawty has a husband
These young niggas are smarter
Don't do it [x3] (noooooo)
She playing
I can't panic, I don't panic
They are playing, don't panic
Are they people in loafers
Oh lord, I can't panic, don't panic
There is no time to plan it, there is no time to plan it
100 keys in the attic, 100 keys in the attic
Oh Lord
2 birds in the kitchen; 1 brick, 1 desert eagle
If the cops rush, better rinse off
You better pray to God that they don't see you
Because they F-E-D-S Boys want L-I-F-y E you
So don't be scared, don't be scared, if they catch you
Don't panic, nigga's statements fall in the
All the hood, they grabbed the nigga and he rammed
I've got you guys like 30 years still walking
And he standing, I bet he would have been one of my niggas
My lawyer cost 100,000, niggas, rats counting without remorse
Shoot us, no reports, we shoot them they go to court
And when the boys start running nigga don't freak out
I can't panic, I don't panic
They are playing, don't panic
Are they people in loafers
They look for people and they look for sofas
There is no time to plan it, there is no time to plan it
100 keys in the attic, 100 keys in the attic
Oh Lord
Pussy niggas panic, I could see the panties
Rain, snow or sleet, I'm on these streets
And it's so organic, WB but not Atlantic
Play with me and I bet I'll handle it, 30 G's, 20 shows a month
That's too much to count and too much to manage
Damn, an enemy, I've lived a hard life
Nigga Meek Milly, counted my first million
It was then that my whole life changed, I swear loyalty to the streets.
That I would never panic if the FEDS came
That's in everything, money, bags and the game of bread
My partner and they are my partner and they
I can't panic, I don't panic
They are playing, don't panic
Are they people in loafers
They look for people and they look for sofas
There is no time to plan it, there is no time to plan it
100 keys in the attic, 100 keys in the attic
Oh Lord
(Wife your girl)
Did you hear that
They call me Meek Milly, also known as Mr. Philly.
And as my nigga Big Re would say
If you don't like it, kill your damn nigga
I got my first eight ball and I was bananas
Because I started to flip like little mini cameras
He turned that into a room, he turned a room into a middle
Somebody say niggas with them bricks in the ass
When I was bankrupt he used to tell me to go get the loot
I hit you on the head, you stay in shock as if you were Pikachu
I see you chasing the bitches trying to fit in with the [?]
That is why I am now at the dealership trying to choose the coupe
Because you were in the club and I was in the trap
Shit, I was patient, I wasn't running like I hadn't run back
Shit, I was waiting because I had that money coming back
Put them out there with that job and they were running back
I'm already like what you know about it
Ask black people about me in my neighborhood, they know I'm doing it
Sell anything for profit
Money on my mind and my damn conscience
Cause I'm gonna get it black, tell me if you're with it black
I'm a dope boy, I do dope boy shit
Look at that bad bitch standing there, that's my dumb bitch
Six in your head
All these niggas sleeping on me about to shake your bed
Slide over them niggas, ask them niggas what their bread is
Nigga where that bread at
As soon as the niggas die, we step back and retreat
I mean i'm on a cash route
Get it on a fast route
Get it then we get pounded
Ask me about my past
Great twenties the pass
Fucking with them, the bitches tipped them and took out all my stash
I hit my nect, he'll be like what now
I'm like six points, he's like landing
We're headed to hunt, you should duck
Or be rejected when we burst
Well i'm the drug boy
With Gucci and that boy Louie
Money so far but unemployed
I keep selling them squares so my pockets get bigger
I have it if you show it I don't care who knows
While backing up on the spot I received a blocking order
I gotta get that shit together 'cause the money never stops
I have the [?] At hand and I'm about to take a point
And I got these niggas fishing, do they have everything [?] In their hands
But I got to the store because I need another can
Now I'm at Home Depot about to get some acetone.
I told my cousin to bring the press, I'm about to make him stretch
Show you how to get that money that is a drug addict at its best
There are three kinds of niggas in life.
Niggas that make it possible
Niggas watching it go by
And niggas who don't even know what's going on
Choose one...
Shawty said he wants that role
Rari for Benz, I'm swervin '(SKR SKR!, SKR! SKR!)
Fuck rap, I could sell loot
She loves me because she knows I have that Chanel label
She picked me up and went to get Chanel's loot
Her boyfriend says, "Where do you get that Chanel bag from?"

Wetter than a lake, that's Ricki!
Pop Pussy Like Her Nicki
She loves me because she sees me in that Aventador
Pull the sidewalk so crazy that I doubled the door
The bad bitch wants to borrow it, I lent it to her
Make her bust that pussy open in Singapore
30 million yet the Forbes list
Out in Philly in a condo, you fucking boss
In the pool rockin 'polo, Marco
Millionaires, never look
Fruits of my work, go get me my pears
Because you are out of your element; I am your fear
So get out of my testicle, forgive my decimal, bitch!
Look at my resume, I'm rich on higher echelons
The bikes are out and we throw them up like we're sick
My clothing line is in stores and I'm drinking a Myx, bitch!
Do you want to fuck with a drug dealer?
Or keep fucking the broken niggas?
That's dumb, nigga!

Most of these bitches ain't mine, nigga
You can keep that bitch, I swear it's not a penny, nigga
She has no room, I will not spoil her
Think of it as Moses when he crosses the water
How the hell do they say they can pay my bitches?
It's the same niggas rocking Jordans
White boy shoots better than Kyle Korver
300 Spartans, my immortal niggas
Selling fish, I have Nemo and Dory
In the swamp with crocodiles like I'm in Florida
Tryna Gets Rich Like Richard Porter
Taking that Pyrex pot and a glass bowl
And putting my hand in that water
If the bitch tries to take a room
It will be a homicide, law and order
It is cheaper to leave it
But it will cost you some money if you want to pamper her
She got that Aquafina, call her water
She wants to ride on top of my Sequoia
Most of these bitches are not mine

Stop claiming me bitch, you know you're lying
Most of these bitches are not mine

Clean the shine of your lips when you suck your cock
Why do you claim a black? You know you're not mine
Why the hell are you still lying? A little good
I'm not wasting my time, I just spend with pennies
She has the audacity to say that we are married
I'm chasing a nigga like Tom and Jerry
Birds sing like Mary Mary

I'm not a whore if her pussy is hairy
I'm passing your bitch like a Hail Mary
She wants to claim me because I'm famous

Whores, I'm not worried about it
Because everyone knows
Smashed and then she outtie
Let's say she from New York, I had to call my nigga Rowdy
He told me she was coming in, she had that sloppy toppy
So you know what I did?
She told me she wanted a threesome
When you pull, turn on the light, the sliding Forgis

Don't take that thrashing down Twaun
Light that motherfucker, nigga
I know what I say, the critics said this, they wrote that, they are facts that they wrote, feel me
They say you made a milli from Versace, that's a fact
They say before this rap shit you've had it
They said that the rich young black man went global with the network
You niggas sound like friends, that's my lingo, it's a fact
You say there is a new flow in the game, so that's a fact
Niggas be like the takeoff you blew up like I'm fat
There's no vacation in this rap until I see twenty platinum plaques
On the block like it's Shaq
Walk in saks with a sack
I'm fucking the economy like 80 'Crack
You did a lot of Versace, independent, how do you do that
Caught investing in yourself with M & Ms, nigga
I did a milli but I don't think we don't have M&M
That shit you say is not a fact
In the past I played flats
You natnats bother me like a mosquito
Bell bitch different color their tracks
I fell in love with the lean I'm attached to
Fat blunt like a Louisville bat
When you talk to a boss, take off your hat
Break into these houses, set my black Mac free
Yes you can see my black diamond
You can stop commenting on my photos

Broke niggas commenting on my photo "@FakeWatchBusta"
Stop at a nigger with the helicopter, think you saw the Ghostbusters
VS1 in my Cuban necklace, in the VIP section drinking Texas
Bitch I got Africa sitting on my pinky
Trafficking seagulls, they call me beanie
Bentley Mulsanne I rented it, it is not for rent
Red dot for your head, Green dot for my niggas in the penitentiary
Looking very hard, I don't know what they saw

Take a look in my jewelry box, it's open
I have the cash, they say you have chips
Where's the receipt?
Tell him your watch is stolen
Now everyone says they have a Rollie
Remember a year ago rocking Mike Kors
Now when I buy different bags in stores
Get paid in an Audemar that shines like the stars
My jeweler came with some robbery bars
I treated my diamonds as beauty bars
They'll be jumping like a rock star
Not jackson 5 but we are 3 brothers
We keep Nina now we're pop stars
While you're sitting there watch me on Instagram
You can count the rings on my fucking hand
Just eight fingers a hundred bands
Seventy racks for my man Migo
Thirty K for Quavo Rolex
She wants it so much that it's a price check

My watch is authentic, you black watches are for rent
You need to throw it in a blender
When I saw a black watch, I was offended
WatchBusta the judge and they sentenced you
You and your partners are co-defendants
The evidence that your watch is fiction
You went to the jeweler, you broke your marrow
For something that wasn't even official
FakeWatchBusta can't burst me
I'm not busta, my yellow diamonds look like mustard
You need some WD-40, your diamonds are rusty
I come through these bitches that look like busts
You rappers lie, talk about VVS
My diamonds, my diamonds have been tested
I could go to Africa - selection of diamonds
I'm getting my big diamonds straight from Tiffany
My time is counting body energy.
Official fabric of the Rolex company.
Fake watch that is not rich for me
It's not official, you're not cheating on me
Thirty K nigga ain't shit to me
I have the golden ticket Chuck E. Cheese

When I was wrong, was I really asking you guys?
It hurt, I really had to kick their doors and do illegal things
Yes, on the top floor, cross the block like the eyes in Debo (rooster eyes)
Gonna get my money, bitch and keep your eyes on the road
And then she asked me where we are going, I don't know
What are all these questions for?
Back then I was in everything
I got tired of running my mom for shit
So I kicked a door at 17
All my brothers depend on me
All my sisters depend on me
Don't run with me wondering about anything
Do you think I'm going to order some Benjis? Damn, are you thinking?
If a nigga asks me if I need something, it offends me, come on
Breaking the law without co-defendant
Go to jail, I get a lesser sentence
Mansion, I got it
Jewels, I have it, 'Rari, I have it
I used to hit the boat, Adrian Broner
Crocodile moccasin, crocodile hunter
Young nigga, I don't need no help
But I still have an assistant
Unlike you little niggas, your pockets are empty
When it comes to guala, they call me Polomalu (runs to the money)
Brokanese niggas still wear Prada
You know you broke up, you don't think it's a problem
Asking for money, that's not an option
Fucking your bitch, so I took her shopping
If I throw gotti, turn a goblin
Stop begging ho
Shout I must, he is going to get hooked by everything
Young Migo my town
Yeah that Rich Homie shit running all over
Interrogation room, boy, I swear I can't say a name
And let a hundred thousand buy a new mouth

And you know I keep myself protected with the M16
And I'm serving demons, the police at ease
I don't freeze, I'm on the left side, I use both my feet
I'm getting rich with my dogs, please don't get involved
All you need is a call, they will come to leave you
If you're talking about that money, baby, we have it all
Touchdown with that dirty bird like Jamal
Plug count the babies when I saw it said awh
Bitch call my phone, I declined the call
Make like a season, bitch, you need to fall
Broken niggas have a reason to complain baby
I come from nowhere rich to spin like a Tasmanian
You walk through pockets smaller than a Pomeranian

Throwing balls like it's Ludacris
Your silly jewelry
Your diamonds are not fooling me
I am a chief of the nawf
Don't chase these bitches' cause they got flaws
I'm at the mansion with two strippers who told them to call when they left
Hit that bitch with that stick now he eats his food with a straw
Drinking Actavis, I'm drinking syrup, I have no cough
Fuck the media, they slander my name on blogs
Wikipedia, they got the Migo stream on what they thought
These bitches fucking for nothing
These niggas flex with nothing
That nigga was talking, we arrested him
Fucking that bitch and her cousin
I'm a rich black bitch, I get more money than your husband
She's a rich bitch, nigga, you try to spoil her, she don't want it
I woke up in the morning with two bitches who made porn

If the police busting my side, I'm blushing
I got your bitch sucking me, not Similac
Chopper nails a black man like a thumbtack
If I take a loss, I'll get it back
They're stealing the flow and I'm sick of it
Yung Rich Nation jeans, my thirties under that
I've been playing but not Tennessee, lots of racks
They separated from the black and white mansion.
Not angry white people we live that
Broken bitches need to back off
Nat nat stray cats
Behind the building fucking on my tracksuits
I'm dabbin 'and watching like Cinemaxx
Hit your bitch and give her a heart attack
You still call it loot, don't call it that
First I grab the microphone, blow a battery, then I fall
You need to get up and get up your ass and get yourself a sack
I'm not talking about money, I'm not trying to hear that and then go back
Bad bitches boss up (boss up ay)
Broken bitches fall back (fall back ay)
Rico nigga boss up (boss up ay)
Longway hit for that (what you tell them)

I'm going to hit the pussy like a fight night
Hit him with the left, hit him with the right
I'm a rich black, I don't like a black bitch
Snitch nigga, broke nigga, I don't deal with you
All my niggas, officers, my bitches are skrippers
My niggas are criminals trying to reach the M&M
If your bitch is so innocent, why is she sucking my kids?
The bad bitch claps him like Magnolia
Rich young black man on the couch talking to Oprah
Bottles in the VIP while I'm standing on the couch
I don't speak your language, Brokanese, I thought I told you
These bitches are smoking hookah, my nigga dances like Hoosiers
Stop at the Double R, go scare, bitch, Freddy Krueger
Franck Muller flooded
Broke niggas stand left
Lil 'mama, she keeps looking at me (Lil' mama!)
I'm going to hit the pussy like a fight night
Hit him with the left, hit him with the right
I'm going to hit the pussy like a fight night
I'm going to hit the pussy like a fight night

This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
This is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)
I just end the plug with words
I placed the order, I ordered the birds
She put them in a car and then a young black skurrt
Teen bands in suitcase no flex
Young black man in the hood, walking around sold
From a young black man playing like a net
Finish the plug, I don't need a Benjamin
Judge out of court so you know I'm innocent
Smoking with gas stands out longer than incense
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
Juug, finesse, theft
I have to have a thousand
I was raised on the hill like Jack and Jill
Do anything just to pay them bills
My brother caught 15 waiting for the pill
When a nigga broke, he came to your throat
I try to sell the coca but it really is soap
My little nigga Shad smoked
Shit turns real, nigga tried to kill
All this shit for a dollar bill
Hoes get you ready, they don't give a shit
Trying to get you money, see who you fuck
The plug is like a socket, I have to hold the rocket
All my robotic cars
No Master P, but "I'm Bout It" disappeared
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
This is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)
Turn your head bitch into a dirty dancer
I'm cooking and wrapping chickens
Finessing these niggas on tickets
If I fuck you I give you a drop
My shoes are from Prada or Bally
Finessing since I can remember
My doll so cold, December
That steel enveloped me like Bender
Difference between you and me
I'm real and you're a suitor
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
This is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)
From the jail cell, my wrist was so sick that it became sickle
Working my wrist like a ferris wheel
You say this and that that fills my pocket
We don't forgive no nigga, cut off his head and show me he's real
We have diamonds and gold is not stainless steel
Independent we didn't make a deal
I know you heard about the shoot
I know you heard a ruthless nigga
Bitch see the touch
When I copied the Coupe, they were mad at me.
Hoes calling me daddy daddy
I'm a rich nigga, you can check my status
Money counter do the sum
I bought an Aladdin rug
Then I can delicacy and do magic
Acting like I really don't know a nigga
Acting like I really didn't owe him a nigga
He'll blow a nigger, he's not talking about a damn black mower
Young niggas cheating at the corner store, nigga
So many gold pendants on my chain you would think a black man won a black trophy
Flex like a fighter action figure
Hocus pocus, stop on a Lotus and my sick diamonds it's like I got Ebola
Wait take off, wait take off
So the black running away
Flip your body like it's fucking soft
Hole in one as if we were playing golf
I took your girl last night, I put her on the Lamb
Every time she sees me, understand it and she knows
Now when I turn my wrist in that bowl it's spectacular
Niggas wanna be me, yeah cause I'm single
Stop on a nigga, I'm smoking tarantula
I see you flexing, acting, you're a character
My doll looks like red Kool-Aid, oh my god
Bitches suck me like I'm Dracula
Young rich black man, take your camera
Everyone wants to raise Panarama
Quavo every time I lift the camera
Taking a trip to pick up the pounds
I fuck with the damn Pedro and I know John Rico
I can't forget Nino
I took out the cheeto
Pull up the block on the Lamborghini keys to the [?]
Keys to the [?], Keys to the [?]
Ooh like the lingo, long money like
If you hear what rappers sound like friends
True story
It's not a lie
No flex
Look at the diamonds on our neck, VVS
The man continues like Lambo
Shoutout to YRN Lingo

Yes Migo Bandz, I could cook a whole gram
Young Mango Foo dropped out of school
But he keeps the tool
All my niggas get that dough

Versace Versace Versace
Twenty bitches in the lobby
I just got home from the slammer
Plug shipping job into bananas
Lindsay lohan and amanda
Feeling like Tony Montana, the world is mine, I'm not lying
I have babies and cakes
No dime
Sick in the stomach, I got to work
And bought Lambo mindless
Knocking on doors, selling them bows, whipping them O's
Bentleys and Ross are not selling my soul
My niggas depend on me, M-I-G-O
God is my witness, he knows he was getting it
Ask for forgiveness for the sins I have committed
This isn't rap, 'cause a nigga done
Don't believe me Nigga go ask the critics
Become a Mothra, brother, this Godzilla
Feed it to your plug, it goes where it goes
Nightmares still haunt me
And my nightmares haunt me
But I won't let them get the best of me
I can dance with the devil, but I can't try to be God (Dance, Nope)
Damn that's kinda weird let you try to be better (weird you)
Put these bitches on the pedestal, (bitch)
I'm going to eat it like an edible (eat it)
They love it, they call it incredible (incredible)
They say fuck him he just got out of the doctor (Just out of)
Doctor, doctor, doctor
She's a bad bitch from out of town, she appears like this (Pop yeah)
Stop running around town saying you fuck my bitch (Stop Cappin 'Stop it)
Those young niggas running down, we run right in (Runnin 'in, Runnin' in Runnin 'in)
I'm not talking about a man unless it's Ben (No, Benjamin Franklin, Racks)
She wants to go to the sunken place told her to get dizzy, go ahead
(Stunned, sunken place!)
You put on new fabrics, they let you drip on the floor (Woop, Drip)
(Go brrat, rah)
The helicopter bullet is going out, everyone running away (Hey, Go)
Send them back, they say it all (Send them back, brrrrrrt, Hello)
I do not answer calls
I can dance with the devil, but I can't try to be God (Dance, Nope)
Put these bitches on the pedestal, (bitch)
I'm going to eat it like an edible (eat it)
They love it, they call it incredible (incredible)
She a penny out of the ghetto
New Patek, now walk the high pedestal
He stuffed the Perc down his throat like an edible
I do not hang without breaking, they are not eligible
Make the whole script and I pray not to destroy
Looking at my back, don't hit, attack
Hoppin 'in the hatch, Richard Mille max
Do you want to offer me a thousand? You can get the deal back
Sticks in the field kill pull your tissue back
Give my dog a bone that's a whole rack
Hit them with a cig in the stomach, six pack
Serve a nigga bags steal him that's a summary
Bitch give me your neck until you break your knees
All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is count checks, checks, checks
All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is count checks, checks, checks
All I do is count checks, checks, checks
I'm flexing like I'm a fighter
100k spent spent on the bezel
Ice in my ear like a spider
Gang Migo, they can't handle us
I received a check like I was famous
I'm shit like a fucking anus
If you have that package, I could take it
Now I don't play when I'm aiming
Cut the top off like a brain
I'm running 12 life Give me is
Strong packs my fragrance
Your bitch always faces
Speaking of that stupidity
We leafed through a stupid check
We could go and get the 'Vette
Offset, Religion Tru
Ice on my neck, and it's dripping like its water.
New Bentley, not rented
You can't see me because the window was tinted
She fucks the team, she is very friendly
All I do is flex, flex, flex

Known For Getting To That Lot, Known For Copying Them Vettes
Known for dropping them, leaning as supports
Everything on the block, item in my hand
Some of the bricks are white, some of the bricks are toasted.
I have a plug on that gas, I have a plug on them xans
I will show you how to flex, you will not know the real definition of flex
You're not flogging until the jewels wrapped in a chain just because a young black man had the check
Doing this shit since I was seven
Getting money from 11 years old
I'm all about a check and all a nigga does is flex
All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is count checks, checks, checks
All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is flex, flex, flex
All I do is count checks, checks, checks

Young black ass walking around flexing here
Young fools we're reckless, pull up on a viper
It's scary like Freddy Kruger, he has thugs on the roof with a rifle
I have little thugs where they will shake you
I have very bad bitches who say
I take off the chain, put it on the crowd, lil 'moms start to fight
Pull up and the line is terrifying
I break these hoes without a wife
Beat the pots and pans like Ike and they
Hit these niggas like Tyson did
Pull up in the dark, there's no light with it
I know snakes with a lot of venom
Call CDC to get the anti-poison
All I do is flex, flex, flex

I just call my thugs and they walk with that Tec
I call my jeweler, I drop these bands on my wrist
I came with that fort, to see if I could draw
You walk in that bag and then my niggas are gonna steal
I put Louis in my shoes, designer on my belt

I don't mean to flex the club, when I remixed his butt
You say that's your girl but she trashed the whole damn clique
My bitch from Quebec, her father, he's my connection
I ride Gucci, these hoes can't turn me down
Movies made, no actor, no director, just dumb
You, beyond the peanut but you are so "punny"
Flexing on these hoes, money all in my note

E-every place where a young black man goes
You are going to see a hundred thugs yelling "Migo"
And a real Benz scale full of dough
Hitting a drought, collecting in a boat
Extend the old school and free Bo
It should be illegal when you flex these hoes
Whipping the pot until his arm swells
The drugs he throws away, the diamonds are frozen
Bustin 'the block with the rest of these O
I have to get money, the plane is leaving
Flexing on these hoes, money all in my note
Designer of all my clothes, walk with them O's
Flexing on these hoes, money all in my note

Oh!
I gave her everything I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we jump out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) we jump out the porch
I have so many decisions, crows fly with pigeons
I beat the boat, while you are the witness, prove me, we do not aim at the kidneys
I launch a perc to call my tensions; we install it in the city
I have your hoe in my DM; I have your hoe in my mentions
Then they were gone for a month
Then go catch it all the way in Kansas
Nigga never traveled in transit
Hit the pot like a canvas
Feeling like Jamie Foxx, cuz I'm in love with a bitch named Fancy
When I started receiving money, now you can't stand me
I almost lost my life, one night in Miami
I return to Miami, drinking the hammock
I can't love her cause she does more, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she does more

I can't love her, that bitch is the one who does the most
Do you want to close my door, why are you mad at me?
But you're calling my phone, standing at my door
Kill yourself, jump off the building
I go into the kitchen, I grab the knife and I'm going to cut your throat
I don't do favors; you know it's a no
I fucked them up on the dab, getting on the show
Kicking a door, when the side becomes slow
Fuck the pot, they want more
These bitches fucking for (zero)
These bitches abandon it
I guess you want lust for trust
I am like a squirrel; I just want a nut
Take the pot and give it an uppercut
Most of these niggas are dick riding nowadays
Tell these niggas to wrap it up
Like an octopus, I make money in eight ways
Young Takeoff, my stack is up
As I recall, two years ago I had them say fate
Remember that they spoke and doubted us
Now when I walk the Earth, I make the street explode
I can't love her cause she does more, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she does more
Independent, we jump out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) we jump out the porch
We fly business; are you mad because you're a flying coach (lil bitty bitch) yes your flying coach

She fucking niggas; she tries to be great
She broke like a bitch; she has nothing to lose
Give up just to put on some Loub
How can I lie, bet that thing like a pool?
All these bitches adore the crew
There's no one in one that we fuck for both of us
YRN fashion, I'm applying you
You're mad at me now, so I'm laughing at you
You have something to do; they hit you in a room
Mom told me not to jump the broom
They are hungry for money, they try to get boyfriends
I think I like the bitch, but I can't be the bitch's wife
Beat crack; I can make a deuce
Giving it back, make one brick become two
By bringing it back, make one brick become two!
I gave her everything I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we jump out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) we jump out the porch

Hit 'em with a hundred rounds (BOW)
POW, fuck it - nigga talkin'bout
Clown makes no sound
I'm fucking bitch
You're crazy and shit
Young nigga, I hold extended clips (extended)
My nigga has whips
My nigga, they play with the dirty stick
I know you're crazy
I know you hate
Because you and you partnas did not eat (are you hungry?)
I arrive at eight, bitch is the date
The Audi comes with the skates
I'm good from state to state
If you go to that state, you could be raped (rape them)
Clocks stacked on my plate!
(Chorus)
(Take off)
I am cooking tilapia
I live a magazine article
Bitches like Twitter
These photos are always gone, follow us
Raise the street like the Opera
I run block like the mafia
Selling that gas to my rasta
It came from my white boy
I have that sage
These niggas think they're pouring out
Drink so sweet I don't need Jolly Ranchers
Tell your girlfriend that you are a character
You play so hard that Jolly Ranch
Flashing my diamonds is dancing
Takin 'straight through the gadget
Pull my mansion
I got your bitch dancing dirty
(Chorus)
Migo!
It feels like we're in this motherfucker for a long, long time man
Forest Whitaker, huh?
We have great weapons like Marvin
I'm spitting fire like arson
Jump of the Lamb and don't station it
You are talking about gas, we have a forest
It came from the gump, not Forrest
An open eye like a forest
(Who are you talking to?) Forest Whitaker
If you did not understand the photo
My niggas keep the big missiles
(Who are you talking to?) Forest Whitaker
If you did not understand the photo
My niggas keep the big missiles
Enter your house safely as Whitaker
And the black is called Cecil
So I have to take care of my people
Mansion has a panic room
Dare with a black, try to break into it
It came from the gump, I feel like Forrest
Walking the trap that I'm experiencing
It's a new day and a bird will sing
Niggas rich in the same thang
All this gold like I'm living in Zulu
Welcome to my kingdom as Shaka Zulu
I don't want your hoe because she works voodoo
Spaguetti, Baguetti, you don't like it but you do
Forest Whitaker
We have great weapons like Marvin
I'm spitting fire like arson
You are talking about gas, we have a forest
It came from the gump, not Forrest
(Who are you talking about?) Forest Whitaker
If you did not understand the photo
My niggas keep the big missiles
Enter your house safely as Whitaker
(Who are you talking about?) Forest Whitaker
My niggas keep the big missiles
Enter your house safely as Whitaker
Beware the check, Forest Whitaker
Bloodsport, shit can go physical
I like the color of money, they call me Amos like I'm Forest Whitaker
I'm riding the sprinter is bulletproof
No Forrest, but I'm in the phone booth
My shiny diamonds look at you
Canary yellow diamonds, Pikachu
Every Halloween we take out costumes
And these kids love me like I'm a cartoon
The streets are like the Vietnam War.
When the bitches see me they're hit by the stars
I can't argue without niggas' cause shit can get physical
The bullets were flipped and it was critical
I don't think I hit them, but I know I hit them because they call them Whitaker
We have great weapons like Marvin
I'm spitting fire like arson
Jump of the Lamb and don't station it
You are talking about gas, we have a forest
An open eye like Forest (who are you talking about?)
Forest Whitaker, if you didn't understand
My niggas keep the big missiles
Enter your house safely as Whitaker
Forest Whitaker, if you didn't understand
My niggas keep the big missiles
Enter your house safely as Whitaker
Young niggas on the block don't give a shit
I know we will still make it
This is the life we choose and do I know we did a milli
But you can throw it all away, I know we'll still make it
The formula (the formula)
Everyone wants to get the formula
They'll try to take his life to get the formula
So I keep my money and my strap like an armored truck
Are you saying black youth have no money? Do you think it's hurting us?
Make you believe in Santa Claus, the sack of Santa is in us
I know they hate it coming out of a bag
I don't have to brag or boast just looking at the money
Nigga don't make me mad
This is why I had to put extensions on all my magazines.
All my life, a young black man would get into something
Young black man came out of nowhere
Now I was able to learn the different lingo that private jets take across the country
You know you need it, you want it
Migo the moment they say we stole it
And we burn the photo

Remember to catch a dwarf when he was coming

Young nigga catching bags
On the block with Cam running from the fucking tag
Jump on the end, the young black man hits the board
One thing about the nigga migo line knows we live fast
Large amount of cash, OG cash bag in Jag does not have to run
Walk in the mall, nigga, don't check the price, just throw it in the bag
Make a move and get the cash back as fast as the flash
It's not loot, we call it dab
Money Packs the Whole Slab!
Young niggas on the block don't give a shit

If you don't grind, you won't shine
I have the ingredients to make you single
African diamonds, smoking in [?]
Lil 'bitches in the kitchen water spanking makin' chickens to buy me a Bentley
I bought the semi smoke it like a fireplace
The sins that the lord committed will forgive me
The flow we made up for you niggas is unfortunate
Can you keep a chicken for my leverage if you make me a whole milli?
Cheap bags call it [?]
I have the eagles, I'm not from Phili
Giving needleless nigga shots
Three friends we are the new Beatles
Smashing your bitch into the fetus
Young niggas on the block don't give a shit
We had to get it
We can lose everything today
I know we will still make it
This is the life we choose and do I know we did a milli
But you can throw it all away, I know we'll still make it

DJ Durel
Murda on the beat so it's not good
See you in the trap, I'm having pounds
Niggas with straps, don't come
Niggas gettin 'all white, yeah, that step down
Ho damn, get kidnapped
Drowns the bricks in the water, takes a bird bath
All white diamonds like RiFF RAFF
Trap! Turning and breaking the packages, I have the trap in the back
Giving them hell, DJ Durel, look at the drug on the scale
Drinking the lean, moving like snails, but I'm still wrapping the bullet belts
Clientele, clientele, bitch, I've been running since twelve
Pounds Mail, Migo Gang Label Poster
See you on the side, flipping bricks like a sandal
I have a helicopter, and it's camouflage, monkey nuts, lots of ammunition
I received more blows than a candle, they stopped me in Bugatti, I don't kiss
Migo Gang, we're so ignorant, take your dope, take your flats and shit
Rolex, my doll kisses, I could take your bitch for a blow
Look at my bitch, she's British, my Australian crocodile is fit
And when the herd in the city, we pack them on their land
I have O, there are no nouns
Married to the money, he made a vow
DJ Durel
Baby i'm on the way
But everything is fine though
That boy Cas
But everything is fine, everything is fine
Baby keep calling my phone
Do you want to know when I will return home?
She tells me that I'm fucking bitches
And I told her that she tripped
Do you want to investigate me when I enter the room?
And why don't you pick up your phone?
I've been on the road stacking money
Because she stays home alone
But everything is okay
All good
He told me to stop catching but you told me
All my hard work was worth it
Shawty stayed down from day one
Okay, I'll be on a private jet to Portugal to pick up some Benjamin Franklins
The OG keep telling me "boy, are you going to make history"
I said to my bitch, you better ask for a nigga on these streets
We can go to MIA to see the palm trees.
Lamborghini, man, we stop at Daytona Beach
When I look into her eyes, I make her panties drip
She probably still won't believe it, so we took a trip to go to Belize
But everything is okay
When I come in with them M & Ms
And I tell you to count this great bankroll
He told me to stop catching but you told me
All my hard work was worth it
I gotta keep her by my side like my gun Tommy
Put on my jewelry, baby, shine like the sun
Quavo talk to them, ooh
You know you're shining baby
I want to thank your mom, my God, what a creation
I want to welcome you to my mansion with an invitation
I'm a young black man, I'm not used to relationships
So you know I'm not patient
She told me she was black and Asian
But she likes it when I bring the deep
Mom told me not to eat hoe sauce
But you know a nigga really likes you
But you try to close my empire
You too bipolar, baby, you shoot
Baby keep calling my phone
Do you want to know when I will return home?
She tells me that I'm fucking bitches
And I told her that she tripped
Because you must be away from fungi
Do you want to investigate me when I enter the room?
Talking about where you've been
And why don't you pick up your phone?
I've been on the road stacking money
Speaking of which I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
Because she stays home alone
But everything is okay
When I come in with them M & Ms
And I tell you to count this great bankroll
However, you want to leave the neighborhood
Shawty stayed down from day one
I gotta keep her by my side like my gun Tommy
I had to fly to Las Vegas to show him I'm a gamer
Booty fatter than Deelishis, when I hit her we lay down
Together we get down on our knees and pray our prayers
There are no trials and tribulations, we have some patience
25 has two cars and a house for which he pays
So what more could you ask for? The first night I was angry, I didn't crush him
And that taught me a lesson, lil 'mom has to be special
She just wants to kick me, we can travel anywhere
She knows I have a busy schedule, sometimes she's acting selfish
When I hit her, she quits because she says it's too much pleasure
She tells me that her favorite song is handsome and rich
She loves it when I'm kissing her body, it starts melting her
I'll be murdering the pussy, I should have another criminal
We stick together just like salt and pepper
But everything is okay
Baby keep calling my phone
Do you want to know when I will return home?
She tells me that I'm fucking bitches
And I told her that she tripped
Because you must be away from fungi
Do you want to investigate me when I enter the room?
Talking about where you've been
And why don't you pick up your phone?
Because she stays home alone
But everything is okay
When I come in with them M & Ms
He told me to stop catching but you told me
However, you want to leave the neighborhood
All my hard work was worth it
Put on my jewelry, baby, shine like the sun
I'm going through my nigga ain't even loyal
He made fun of the boy, I heard him from my lawyer
I'm going through it, my bitch isn't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth it
I'm passing it, my brother in the cage
I'm going through it, I have to get this money
I always travel abroad, codeine what I'm pouring
I'm passing it
I'm going through it, man, this shit is so crazy
'07, I lost my brother, 15 years in cages
A thousand dollar specs in my face to block the haters
My bitch fucked the whole team, I should never have saved her
I thought I loved that bitch down to the fucking core
I bought him Jimmy Choos, I bought him Juicy Couture
I treated her like a queen, but she was the neighborhood prostitute
And now she tries to travel with me because now I'm on tour
Money, money, money, my fingers hurt
I'm shooting a hard hitting 3-5 look like a core
The feds are watching me, they still serve J's, I'm paranoid
I'm going through my nigga ain't even loyal
I'm going through it, my bitch isn't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth it
I'm passing it, my brother in the cage
My grandmother in the grave, the Lord told me to be patient
I'm going through it, I have to get this money
I'm passing it
I had to go to Wal-Mart and pick up some Arm & Hammer
And go hard in the kitchen, nothing but tickets
Do numbers flogging water, Young Quavo, yes I did
My bitch, she trashed the whole team, damn it, that's too friendly
So when I sign that deal, I know I'm not going to buy that without Bentley
I haven't seen him in two years, now he wants to come, he has to know something suspicious
And I told my mom that if something happens to me, she can have my riches
Young Quavo, I won't leave my wealth to any of these bitches
Because once you die and you go, she'll have another nigga in your kitchen
Whipping water, show her how you did it
If I get her the Bentley, she'll have another nigga in that Bentley
I'm going through my nigga ain't even loyal
He made fun of the boy, I heard him from my lawyer
I'm going through it, my bitch isn't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth it
I'm passing it, my brother in the cage
I'm going through it, I have to get this money
I always travel abroad, codeine what I'm pouring
I'm passing it
I've been going through that, shit has been crazy
My ancestors have been going through it, back then in slavery
Now the fastest time, I'm the teacher
Every move I make is spectacular
Northside is my nation, and I am an ambassador.
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
That would hurt my heart, prolly would have no heart
Prolly would have stopped at that moment, prolly wouldn't have been a start
Back to kick doors, back to put cars on them
But I pray to God, because he cured my mother
If you're talking about that bread, then I want every crumb
Running to money like I'm in a marathon
Smoking in that kush, it smells like an armpit
And the check says I want to marry my thumb
Go through it like a black man locked up with no bond
I'm passing it
2000, I lost my cousin RiRi, rest in peace
'07 I lost my big bruh to the feds
Free Player Done
I just lost my grandmother
Rest in peace Sally Smith, I love you
Fact took so many defeats, it's okay for us to win
I'm going through it, my bitch isn't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth it
I'm passing it, my brother in the cage
My grandmother in the grave, the Lord told me to be patient
I always travel abroad, codeine what I'm pouring
I'm passing it
I'm going through it, man, this shit is so crazy
'07, I lost my brother, 15 years in cages
Now my grandmother rests in peace, that was my first lady
A thousand dollar specs in my face to block the haters
I'm going through it right now but I'm still chasing the paper
My bitch fucked the whole team up, I should never have saved her
And now I'm going crazy, because I'm just going through it
I still walk with Rugers because I like to shoot them
I thought I loved that bitch to the core mothaf * ckin '
I bought him Jimmy Choos, I bought him Juicy Couture
I treated her like a queen, but she was the neighborhood prostitute
And now she tries to travel with me because now I'm on tour
Money, money, money, money I got into a Porsche
Money, money, money, money I have
I'm shooting a 3-5
The feds are watching me, they still serve J's, I'm paranoid
I'm passing it, my niggas in jail
I had to go to Wal-Mart and pick up some Arm & Hammer
And go hard in the kitchen, finessin '
Do numbers flogging water, Young Quavo, yes I did
My bitch, she trashed the whole team, damn it, that's too friendly
I haven't seen him in two years, now he wants to come, he has to know something suspicious
And I told my mom that if something happens to me, she can have my riches
Whipping water, show her how you did it
If I get her the Bentley, she'll have another nigga in that Bentley
I've been going through that, shit has been crazy
2000, I lost my cousin, I cried like a baby
My ancestors have been going through it, back then in slavery
Now the fastest time, I'm the teacher
It could have been me back then, nigga it would have been like "F * ck your teacher"
My name is Takeoff, I'm NASA
Every move I make is spectacular
Northside is my nation, and I am an ambassador.
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
I remember back in '07, I almost lost my mother
That would hurt my heart, prolly would have no heart
Back to kick doors, back to put cars on them
If you're talking about that bread, then I want every crumb
Running to money like I'm in a marathon
Foreign bitch, blow up a zan like she blows up a gun
And the check says I want to marry my thumb
Go through it like a black man locked up with no bond
I'm passing it
2000, I lost my cousin RiRi, rest in peace
I just lost my grandmother
Rest in peace Sally Smith, I love you
I would like to welcome you to the Green District
Green neighborhood, Green neighborhood, Green light
Run to me, I'm gonna take your life, walk the trap just to see how demons like it
Quavo Peter Piper had to pack a gun
I have the black shooter, I won't miss you
Set my niggas free, I got the crimes, fuck the system
The boat is naked, I examine it as a physical examination.
Listen, this shit here is critical
I can teach you how to make it identical
Remix, re-rock go fleeting in a black pot
Drip, drip, I have to spray in the pot
Plug says he has a lot of dwarfs
Green neighborhood, Green neighborhood, Green light
Green neighborhood, Green neighborhood, Green light
It's a price for your tight black, you better pay attention
30 round extension
Bullets in the mouth like dentures

Hit the nigger with the four and four

Plug says he has a lot of dwarfs

Or is it the way I get along?
Don't keep that secret
Bitches say I'm acting funny cause a young nigga got a lot of money
She looks at me like she wants something
I can't give you anything but a couple hundred
She sucked a nigga, try to kiss a nigga, baby, you're stumbling
(I don't know how you feel, can you tell me?)
I know why you came to this club tonight
Looking for a nigga that will change your life

Ten promoters in my damn back end
I have a pint of fat every time Guapo flies in the city
The streets they taught me never show sympathy
I swear I never thought I'd be on MTV
They M & Ms the only thing that interests me
I know why they envy me
Back then they weren't fucking with me
Now they can't get enough of me
Paparazzi takin 'pictures
Young independent niggas playing like the big leagues
I am allergic to brokanese
Young black man came from below
I was on the block before dawn
Then a young black man like me had to shine
A long way from bustin 'bands and sirin' Ziploc
Solid foundation, quality control label
Shit!
Must be joking
Slam my nigga
Nah, nigga don't play with me
Do not mess with me
They say he left with the pack, damn it (he must be kidding)
They say the plug is turning off like Nino Brown (must be kidding)
They say the nigga who stole you from the trap right now (must be kidding)
I bet I'd stop and start shooting the whole crowd, nigga, better stop messing with me! (Grah, Grah)
Do you know that they take your style? (must be joking)
Everything is on the radio, like now! (must be joking)
Who the hell said we are a one-hit wonder? (must be joking)
Who the hell said QC that we are not upstairs? I have to be joking
The niggas who didn't believe in me
The people who did not believe in me
Versace, Versace topped the charts
Now i'm on the couch with oprah
Louboutins all on your couch
No conditions because these loafers
Green like Shrek who is an ogre
Taking my loot and exposure
Stop at your home and exclude
They say he left with the pack, damn it (he must be kidding)
They say the nigga who stole you from the trap right now (must be kidding)
I bet I'd stop and start shooting the whole crowd, nigga, better stop messing with me! (Grah, Grah)

Quavo!
I thought I told you fucking nigga better stop playing with me
Jump with the dirty stick, the drum, it has infinity ('finity)
My bitch rides 50 chicks on a SRT (brrrr)
I will not leave high school, there is no shame in me
I'm richer than my teachers, damn it, I know I bet they're mad at me (look at them)
With your red light on, on the side do it like Krispy Kremes (go away)
Hit the pot with the left hook, (skrt) Quavo-Kareem (ooh)
They say he left with the pack, damn it (he must be kidding)
I bet I'd stop and start shooting the whole crowd, nigga, better stop messing with me! (Grah, Grah)
Do you know that they take your style? (Must be joking)
Everything is on the radio, like now! (must be joking)
Who the hell said we are a one-hit wonder? (must be joking)
My sloppy pockets like lasagna, nigga stop messing with me
Make up for
You all niggas imitate me (Copy me), are you kidding me? Literally
Block control with good quality (QC)
Hurricane in the kitchen, a catastrophe
I'm the number one other niggas chase after me (number one)
Wrapping my bitch with Tiffany diamonds
All of you niggas pussy talking and arguing
It doesn't even make sense (no)
You're handcuffing the same bitch I fucked in my Bentley (handcuffing her)
Whoosh, missing package (woosh)
As soon as you touch my hand, it instantly disappears (go away)
Diamonds on me like it's a photo
Guiseppe Zanotti walking in komodo
Catching and covering we are selling that yayo
They say he left with the pack, damn it (he must be kidding)
They say the plug is turning off like Nino Brown (must be kidding)
They say the nigga who stole you from the trap right now (must be kidding)
I bet I'd stop and start shooting the whole crowd, nigga, better stop messing with me! (Grah, Grah)

My sloppy pockets like lasagna, nigga stop messing with me
Get on the club with a hundred strong racks
Bad foreign bitch, yeah she came from Hong Kong
VVS shines like someone who turns on the lights
Drinking lean smelling like this Kush Calone
Upper floor in condos, pull up using red rose gold
Pourin 'lean for all 4, bad bitches at my show
Go up, go up, go up every time you see the Migos
Gates of Lambo, she has never been seen before
Yes, Lambo doors, top floor condo
Wearing red rose gold, fucking foreign hoes
I have to keep my hand clean, have a lawyer on my phone
And you know the trap, it'll be booming all night
Could be a True Religion police officer, so I have to take a flight to Hong Kong
I'm walking around with the chrome, when you see the thug, you better go home
Steven Spielberg, take out your camera
VVS glowing so turn off the lights
We're the youngest niggas on the street so everyone's talking
Upper floor in condos, pull up using red rose gold
Pourin 'lean for all 4, bad bitches at my show
Go up, go up, go up every time you see the Migos
Gates of Lambo, she has never been seen before
Upper floor in condos, pull up using red rose gold
Pourin 'lean for all 4, bad bitches at my show
I'm on Lam, she's never been seen before
I'm in the 'rari she has never seen before
Appears when you see the Migos
I have an Eskimo in my earlobe
Red VV 'around my collarbone
Actavis red in my Styrofoam
Black lambo, with butterfly doors.
UFO spaceship, my whip is not even in the store
I'm in the kitchen water whipping the stove
Private jet takes you where you want to go
I'm in the backseat chilling on the Rolls
Shawty crazy, couldn't open the doors
Young black man tries to clone the recipe
Money getting the best of me
Baking soda is the recipe.
When I broke, the baking soda rescued me
I know you haven't seen it
Young black man walking with Louis in the hat
Gotta keep the ratchet 'cause a young nigga schemin'
I had to get Lam out, Shawty doesn't believe me
Gates of Lambo, she has never been seen before
Upper floor in condos, pull up using red rose gold
Pourin 'lean for all 4, bad bitches at my show
Go up, go up, go up every time you see the Migos
Gates of Lambo, she has never been seen before
Upper floor in condos, pull up using red rose gold
Pourin 'lean for all 4, bad bitches at my show
Go up, go up, go up every time you see the Migos
Drop my top, I have mazi fever
What is that in your long and bad bruise? I'm smoking on Keisha
What is that in your bottle? Drinking lean per liter
Damn Quavo, you move too slow, what's the tilt for?
We can cut it on the side, send the package wherever they want to go
Upper floor cooling off in condo, look out, see ocean view
Make all blacks watch this movie, young blacks acting like Tom Cruise
I have Louis V in my shoes, I have your mortgage in my jewelry
I have a Corvette in my jeans, you broke, you don't know what that means
Back then, Shawty, you were acting funny, I'm still broken, you're getting nothing
Gates of Lambo, she has never been seen before
Go up, go up, go up every time you see the Migos
Gates of Lambo, she has never been seen before
I started kicking doors, just for money
Catch the side, just for money (catch the side)
Stick em up, stick em up, just for money (stick em up)
When i woke up this morning
I can't go out with you jabronis
Because you know that's not making me money
I had to cut that bitch, damn it, all I wanted was some money
(You know I hate that gold digging bitch)
I can't hang out with all my friends because they give out
I started kicking doors, just for money
(just for the money)
Catch the side (cheat), just for money (catch the side)
Stick em up, stick em up, just for money (stick em up)
The young black man understood nothing but money (do not undo)
Now that I'm awake these hoes are so easy to fuck (crush)
After my money I did nothing but a couple of chucks (here)
I'm in the jungle (jungle) I'm from the north
They will do it for money because they know I'm the boss
My niggas fight it, rip it off with missiles and cut it
We have green as Boston plays with the keys like he's dealing with salsa
Smoking cookies I'm coughing
You think it's a body that has bricks in a coffin
Black heroin looks brown (black)
Speaking of that shit, then we go
Look at your bitch, look at Lil 'mom stalking her with me now you can stop all the calls
Play with the water like a dolphin
You want that shit, nigga, stop jamming
I can't go out with you jabronis
I had to cut that bitch, damn it, all I wanted was some money
(You know I hate that gold digging bitch)
I can't hang out with all my friends because they give out
Asking for some money
Niggas ask for money, they think it's funny, I give them nothing
You niggas ain't resisting and no I'm not up front
It's 2015 and my double clay cup
You're laughing right now but don't think the shit won't get ugly
Turn them into bread and peel your bun
Your finger fucks light but that doesn't give you a budget
I am smoking the cookie jar with humidity in cookies
I treat the blunt ones like teddy bears and stuff it
You turn to a policeman when you get a handsome guy and handcuff him
Over and over again all about Benjamins
I'm a human being forgive me if I sin
I've been bankrupt before I don't come back anymore
I came so far to fall off the pedestal
I did a walk and walked to Texaco
Talk to Chico and fix it for Regano
You guys so crazy you can't catch a whole guy who's not friends or enemies.
The monts in my pocket, sloppy Joe
Break a ball like my name is Chris Jerico
Niggas my shooters have [?]
Cut the top like Eddie Guerrero
My niggas travel selling marshmallows
Today niggas call me Marshall Lynch the way I got the Seahawks to fly out of Seattle
Stuck in the canoe of the atlanta ocean but don't have a paddle to paddle
When i woke up this morning
I told myself I had to get some money.
(Yeah man I had this crazy dream last night)
I can't go out with you jabronis
I had to cut that bitch, damn it, all I wanted was some money
(You know I hate that gold digging bitch)
I can't hang out with all my friends because they give out
Asking for some money

I ended up with a 4 and 20 ounce shake it with the happy ranchers at that time (shake it shake it)
Go up to the maximum watch me do my thang
It could be purple, it could be yellow (yellow)
I am addicted to Promethazine

You told me to give up my nigga
Now you want to get on the bus my nigga
You see me dancing, now you can rush my nigga
I feel like Hammer, I can't touch my nigga
That's what I call Trap Funk, my nigga
Looking like a young James Brown in the kitchen
Got into the game, I can't trust these bitches
But everyone wants to fall in love with these bitches
Run from the north, grab a hoe and win a million
Make a basic bitch feel like Hillary Clinton
Let's talk about the rapper swagger jagger niggas
Put the powder in my hand so I can hit a nigga
I had dust on my hand before the black monkfish
In the north he turned the camp into a black mansion
Millions of dollars in cash on the exchange
I have to 'pay for' you take it away
Grandma died, mom cried a million times
Gun Pete died, he still cried a million times
Life was worth all these hard years
Money doesn't change, but money changes bills
Damn, life was so difficult (life was so difficult)
Life was so hard that I prayed to God
Shit wasn't a good nigga every day, it was hard for me
Stop running out of the crib since 12 throwing the cars
I've been through the jungle and the forest, I left without a scar
Remember the day Mommy's house sleeps
Quavo woke me up while sleeping
I had a Jordan standing
We are stumbling, taking care of the police
Said I not only lost my shoe, I lost my ID
Take you back about a year ago, catching him on the side
Long before niggas start using the Migos stream
When my pockets hurt I had to kick a door
I'm going to sleep, I was dreaming of hitting the lottery
Wake up actually, you gotta get every dollar
You told me to leave it, but look how you left 'continue
Niggas that talking went 'holla
Brush the dirt off my neck
Return to guala
Yeah niggas, I still played season (you forgot)
Errbody 'know we ain't got no tag (nigga independent)
We come in as rich young blacks
One less man but no one can replace him (Offset)
I'm not afraid of anyone, only my creator (God)
There is no prayer for anyone, only my savior
I don't fuck with any of you niggas cause you're fleeting
The hard life of life is whatever you do
Damn, life was so difficult (life was so difficult)
It was very difficult (life was very difficult)
Damn, life was so hard (life was so hard)
I'm a g
Locked in the game

I'm addicted but don't call me addicted
Because a drug addict doesn't walk with all this money

Nobody disappointed me to sleep, I prayed in all my soul (?)
And it's going to be a murder case.
But I don't care about the case because my lawyer is going to win the case
Beat the case, stop the case, eat the case, beat the case
I'm Benny Honda eating well
And I get calls from all of you niggas (?)
The way they speak they celebrate me like I'm on vacation
This for my nigga who's addicted to the block
This for my nigga that has been a gold chain juuggin
This is for my nigga who's been locked in the game
Been locked in the game

To hold 9 'with B
They always try to find me
But I have the cash to bill
I can't stay off this street
I need to see a million dollars
Before I leave these streets
These bandz all about me
But it's still a fucking fight
Now i'm harder and stronger
These niggas are going to test me because I'm keeping that (?)
This for my black addicted to the handsome
This for my nigga who's addicted to the block

Field Marshal Migos Troy Aikman
Screaming mom, we made it
Young black man came from below
Young black man go find the guala
Catch a Ramada hotel
They call me Quavo Mufasa
Open the trap like a corpse
We know you impostors niggas
They like pina colada
I mix it with a little powder
Hit a nigger with a helicopter
It will take about forty-eight hours.
The Chattahoochee where they found it
My niggas go get the reward
We hold them for ransom
Migos on top of the mountain
I have the pigeons and the hawks
Now I have the keys, I used to catch ounces
Came from the boards of the houses
They niggas say I call them mice
Bobby Shmurda free and my boy Rowdy free
I come from the pavement
Look at them niggas, they're mad because I made it
Look at their faces
Because I'm on top, no one can replace it
I used to be stealing
Hang with the thugs, my niggas were goblins
Turning the north side into a little Harlem
Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and raiding
My niggas came from the pavement
Speaking of that shit, boy, put it away
You are talking about cookies, we are baking
I fell in love with the faces
Screaming mom, we made it
My niggas came from the pavement
As many chains as slavery
Taking a trip to Croatia
Plug shipped the package from Haiti
Counting these Benjamin faces
Young black man, I got rich with the Caucasus
My gang, there's no trade
Fucking these bitches, of different races
Rick Owens, they came without laces
Cooking drugs and addicts will try it
Your bitch gave me brains, that's my favorite
I told that bitch to take care of her teeth because she had braces
People hate me, just because I did it
Talk about me like we're related
You need to sue your jewelry, Rollie is outdated
I'm on the side with the drug boys
Pouring a soda, I leave it contaminated
All my niggas screaming mom we did
Now one of those chains is yours around your neck
We start from the north side, screaming free compensation
I gave him a test, got a vest and then I was hit with the Tec
Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and raiding
Speaking of that shit, boy, put it away
You are talking about cookies, we are baking
Field Marshal Migos Troy Aikman
Screaming mom, we made it
(Hook)
It just blew my head off because my mom saw it (dammit!)
And she had an attack, yes she had an attack (mom)
I told my mom that we were rich, I told my mom that we were rich (rich, go away!)
Seen 100 bands, all at once (I did it)
And she had an attack, yes she had an attack (mom)
I told my mom that we are rich, I told my mom that we are rich (go, go, go, go)
(Verse) (Quavo de los Migos)
Mom had a seizure when she saw my money
She says you have no job, you must do something
What the hell are you doing? Don't get in trouble
I had to take care of my nephew, he looked at uncle
Mom has a nigga, I don't like her butt
I tried to make myself rake the leaves and cut the grass
Nigga, you don't even have kids, what does dad do to you?
Mom kicked him out and now I'm 21
Mom taught me everything, I'm your Danielson
I had to go find him that Porsche before the summer was gone
(Hook)
(Verse) (Gucci Mane)
I was serving junkies out of my mom's window
Daddy is gone, so I guess that makes me feel bad
Mom wanders around my closet, found a joint
She said I raised you better, boy, you have a strong mind
It was a runner for my brother, I need my own plug
I feel like 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne, I need my own drugs.
The first time I put a store on my block I had no luck
(Hook)
The Audi, the Mazzi, the Jaguar
The Bentley, the house by the lake.
Gold on my neck, gold on my wrist
Young Takeoff, I sit in 10K
I'm posted with Guwop, I'm tied up with 2 Glocks
Versace on my back, I feel like 2 Pac
He wanted a whole brick, I gave them re-rock
Pull up on your block, Chevrolet t-top
Finish the stopper for bags
My wrist is spinning like Taz
I know my mom left spaz
She discovers all this money
But fuck it, nigga we're rich
Duckin 'cop, jumping the fence
Now we are in Corderos, tinte Presidente
Seen 100 bands, all at once (I saw it)
It just blew my head off because my mom saw it (dammit!)
And she had an attack, yes she had an attack (mom)
I told my mom that we are rich, I told my mom that we are rich
(Hook)

Bull Bullyin pistols
Loading the AK
Drinking lean while I'm leafing through the horns
Livin at the beach house like I wanted
I'm the million dollar boy
And to me you all fuck niggas looking like they're 100
One hundred cash my nigga
Although I will not send sparks to anyone
You can go and ask them niggas nigga

I'm packing stadiums
They mistake me for ATM

Every day a different payroll (every day)
That they pay me that money from scratch (I came from scratch)
I have paper, kinko
Boxes, UPS, trucks
And FD keeps looking, Rolex watches
Money on the roof, money on the couch
I count more than I can
I'm addicted to that money

(I remember) Motherfuckers said it wouldn't work
We were crazy black youths, huh?
I would like to welcome you to Yung Rich Nation
I know you've been waiting patiently
Yung Rich Nation that's the album
Tryna turns the mansion into a castle
Diamond shine came from Africa, shine, shine (Africa)
(Young Rich Niggas we're some singles) Ooh, damn, single
Turn the club into a massacre (fuck, fuck the club)
(If you're a broken nigga, I'm sad for you, sorry) It's sad to say
First check bought an Audi Coupe
It was black and gray like the Raiders.
It was 10 bands, so I paid it
Remember the time, Offset made me stop
That was right at the neighbors' house?
Remember the time we broke up at the neighbors' house.
That was our first paper route
12 tried to make it my fault
Remember the time your niggas laughed at me
Said I wouldn't join
You say you're trapped, it takes you to the side
I give you a fork, watch what you fight
Before doing the song Hit Em 'wit it
We were hitting niggas
Before making the song 'Birds', pelicans fly south
Niggas talking stupid in the crowd
He jumped through the crowd and hit them in the mouth
The first time we were in Miami, we had a gangsta shootout
Dope in my sock and we pull the trap
Don't get into my trap if you don't announce it (Pussy)
The diamond shine came from Africa (Shine, shine, Africa)
If you're a broken nigga, I'm sad at ch'ya (unfortunate, sad to say)
Do you remember the time, I made my first break and entered?
Because I don't want my uncles to know that I did it
Do you remember the time I was kicked out for having gas hidden in my locker?
In the gym cutting with my classmates
Next thing you know, the cops left you
First juug I hit at school, Lord, please forgive me
I know you remember that
I got home and counted the check
I'm thinking to myself Take off what you will do with it
Call the plug, ask where it is
I'm celebrating smoking on my back
Remember that Quavo came home with a fully developed marijuana plant
Stinkin 'up the cib trying to dry it in the oven it was still wet
I have that drug that talks about anthrax, I hit a fat woman when we hit for fifty racks
The diamond shine came from Africa (Shine, shine, Africa)
Young Rich Niggas we're some singles (Ooh, dab, single)
Turn the club into a massacre (fuck, fuck the club)
To ride Impala with them things
To drive Ferrari with its wings, black
Slip into the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas gives them a hearse
Fuck you niggas even selling work for
I know the main reason that pussy niggas died for
Little nigger, who do you work for?
Because I came for the bosses, I have no losses
You're playing it's dirt to them
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a territorial war
Then I hit the road for my first ride
My level went up to the third floor
And he deviated me from these hateful niggas
MIA with some Haitian niggas
I stopped at that black Wraith like whoa!
(Let me speak, Meek Mill)
I bet you didn't know my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
Sad to say some of my niggas were sentenced to prison (sad to say)
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I feel now
All my life, I wanted nothing more than Franklin
Touchdown in a fucking nigga
Make him get into his shell like Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped off the Lamb as Bruce Wayne
The ten pieces of chicken are on the way
I told Carlito to walk
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just watch them hatching into conversations
I know they don't know!
Black heroine, looks like Willie B
If you make coca cola, you are going to buy some skis
I bet you didn't know my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
Sad to say some of my niggas were sentenced to prison (sad to say)
When at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
Young Takeoff, I'm a professional
Vegetarian, only eat vegetables
I have some kush that you can roll
And I have some kush that you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like it's Mr. Incredible
You have never seen such flexible work
And I light the stove, and I'm hitting the brick
The judge wins ten times, what a miracle
I had to put food on the plate!
Asking the Lord, "Give a nigger a little faith"
My foot on the pedal doesn't touch the brake
There is no chess but, nigger, they gave me a check!
I bet you didn't know my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know, M & Ms)
When at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater (splash), you don't know how I feel now
Damn DJ Plugg, you just killed this
I fucked my ass and she came straight out of Magic (thot)
You work with the fed boy, I hear all that static
I used to sleep on the piss mattress
Now I sleep in a bad bitch and she made of plastic (bad)
Throw me the brick and you know I'll catch it (hey)
Dick on the stick, nigga goin 'into a coffin (brrp)
Poppin 'that shit, he's been poppin' that shit (wait)
I just paid a lil '40 to go get it (pop it, pop it, pop it)
They dig that shit, how am I living and shit
You're wearing nothing but a room, nigga (huh?)
We get the bricks over the borders, nigga (borders)
I took a bitch to the mansion
I kicked the bitch out because she tried to record a nigga (yeah)
I got more water than Florida, nigga
Diamonds dancing, jumping
Bitch for every letter of the alphabet
Smash the Rollie, I can't see where the time is
I drank a 4 in 20 ounce pineapple
Snake with my neck, I think I hear a rattle
Serving the junkies I grew up a bastard
Smoking moon rocks, I'm going to NASA
Bands on me like I'm having a battle
Sherbert the cookie, it doesn't even matter
On the foreign road that a dancer leaves
I'm a designer made of a panda
I walk into this bitch lit like a candle
Too many bricks, I have to classify them (bricks)
Look at my doll, it's water (water)
Your favorite top model is a snort (wooh)
Fuck how you feel, abort them (fuck)
I'm in the field, Portis (field)
Empty shell, turtle (rah)
Give me bail, adornment (bail)
Name a little bitch I'm not gonna get (bitch)
Police try to steal like hornets (twelve)
Send me ten bricks and have fun with it (ten)
If it's not clean, I don't want it (clean)
Leave me a ten for the opponents (ten)
You get a mule or a donkey (mule)
Just give me the extras, I want it (wooh)
I'm with your broad and everything
I'm with my dogs and everything
We stop and we stain the walls (whoa)
I got 9, the uzi, the big bazooka, it's only for a cause (wooh)
And you know that I stay with the white girl
They call a young black mardy
I would like to welcome you all, welcome to Migo's party
Welcome to Milan, my niggas live like Taliban
I have a kickstand, I have Molly Santan, I will be running around Milan
My niggas are playing 'finnesin' every season
I had to turn to a fucking nigger the other day because he thought it was easy
50 gold bottles of the ace of spades that seem to bring me a deck of cards
God gave me a second chance, so the young black man has to go very hard
Beat the pot as Zab Judah
Mansion Party kick it in Bermuda
Calling flippa you nigga my shooter
Cut them into pieces and then put them in refrigerators
Pocket rocket in the club with me
Little mom, little mom, don't dance with me
I have bags at the party without groceries
When you grow up black you don't want to be me
(gone)
Fuck black
Call me Dominique Wilkins
And you know that I stay with the white girl
Call him Jessica Simpson
Pull up and
They call a young black mardy
I would like to welcome you all, welcome to Migo's party
(Flippa)
I party and yes we have narly that no [?]
Snow Bun is Like Cocaine on iCarly
It could be the Fisker but I chose the Rari
We brought him a plate of shrimp when we ate at Bennies
She gets weird [?] When Henny drinks
I'm fucking all night if Molly comes in
The gangster is on me, so I keep a semi
She came to the party, bought her own whiskey
I hit him in the back and then I broke his tits
My diamonds on the glacier, my rollies on fleek
Monopoly money [?]
Can you take three quick flash shots in a hurry?
The way I hit the pot
And you know that I stay with the white girl
Call him Jessica Simpson
They call a young black mardy
What part of Atlanta are you from?
From the north side
Oh yeah
Every show goes crazy and crazy
We are growing and growing every time, every time in a show
Interrupted the game, the industry shook
Three rich young black men, they never pushed
You want the origin of the flow, better shut your mouth
We killed Versace, we went to the Bahamas, we screamed to the islands
Mom and daughters took a picture with me and smiled
Billboard Magazine, 45K
It is said in the street that they say that the Migos wanted
But they can't find the Migos, so they bite their recorders
When you ask for a show, can you seriously afford it?
Look at my dab, it's priceless
And my niggas are fair
I don't have any type, but I love to fuck Pisces
YRN Tha Album first album goes diamond
I have my mom a Benz
Just to show you that I'm grinding
Green dots in the corral but I hate the confinement
When Offset got out of jail he ate a plate of hundreds
I discarded the Rich Nigga timeline and we crossed the country
Three rich young black men, they never pushed
And listen, what do Migos do to cook
Skrrt, kitchen
Graat, shook
I'm catching the target, that Ku Klux
My niggas have grenades and bazookas
One hundred thousand, collected in India
Headed to the locker, we change the millennium
Thirty thousand for a minimum ride
Snakes in the grass start spitting venom
That comes with the territory when a black wins
Tinted windows on the sprinter you don't need to see this image
Blogs say I need to calm down, fuck an image
Choppa sounds like percussion, run with me repercussion
It came out of nowhere, I came home with half a million, my stomach hurt
I am taking good care of my children, but they receive nothing
And if you think it's wrong, this is not the right song you're running into
Welcome to the jungle, lions, elephants, and monkeys.
Never see me alone, better believe Nina in me
Bark stuffed, my pocket walking with a 50 on me
Three rich young black men, they never pushed
You want the origin of the flow, better shut your mouth
And listen, what do Migos do to cook
Pyrex pot on the stove, take that egg whisk to cook
They're looking for the origin, they wanna know how we made this shit up
I went in there and we fucked it up
Jump out of the banana boat, call me King Tut
Niggas bites our loot I tried to change it
But these niggas still don't have enough
Niggas with attitude doesn't matter
The young black man flexing never made a push
Every ten years is in my story brother
I bet you listen, you don't like it
Your favorite rapper, he will be biting
When I walk into the cabin, it's a moment of silence
I bet bitch she gets excited
When I do, I show my front end and that rear end is huge
I need a double drink with my Backwood when I'm on stage performing
I can't get on my tour bus, bitch, I'm not trying to fuck, it's only 5 in the morning
I have some Dominican bitches who suck and fuck and I go back to the origin
Interrupted the game, the industry shook
Three rich young black men, they never pushed
You want the origin of the flow, better shut your mouth
And listen, what do Migos do to cook

Fuck nigga, I go into the club with my Ruger

A Ruger for vaginal intruders
I'm smoking gas like the hookah
We fight for the top
Throwing bows like us Luda
I remember the day
When we played with computers
My bitch in shorts
These enemies are starting so many rumors
Finessing a black ass country in Newnan
Offset is the gift and you niggas is insignificant
Quality control label has money on the table
Trappers bite like a crocodile
Leaving them holes in a black like donuts
I am the talk of the talk
Thanking the Lord for my Mrs. In my prayers
I'm a young black man with all the white neighbors
I stay in a mansion with forty acres

I'm swimming in the money man, I think I'm drowning
I drink a lean fountain in the mansion me

Walk inside the trap and see a garbage bag
I don't throw it away, there's no trash

Sending it on the Titanic
Abracadabra do magic
Skippa the Flippa, not L.A. Clipper
I have a hundred thousand in the Aston
Dirty, a hurricane hits
So much water in the pot causes a tidal wave
Bando looking like a masquerade
Wake up in the morning, turn on my OG
Hitting and hitting that pot, I hit it with the uppercut, that's fatal
Migos and dirty say their fingers hurt
Take out that money counter
Got them hundreds old and blue benjamins
Take out that money counter

We have that money counter
Cook that drug as a hamburger helper
I have a K and a 9 without a German Shepherd
Touchdown on the plug
Give back to the hood that I was never selfish
Adopting the baby, God the Father as Melvin
I'm a cash rebel
Trappin 'and cappin' tryna 'make a life
The higher the risk, the more you get rich
I'm playing with OG and I'm playing with the bricks
I'm caught in the trap, I can't go [?]
Migos and dirty say their fingers hurt

Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
All right when money comes in
And all wrong when money comes out
So the best thing you can do is close your mouth
That's never what daddy told me
And I never serve a nigga who sleeps on the streets
I'm a bully gorilla so I call Willy B
2 cups of sorbet in something light pink
Diamonds clear as water, you can dive into the sea
The designer I paid sauce for all about me
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
I gave my mom 8 bands just to go to the store
I gave my bitch 5 bands just to search and play
In front of me, work because he said he wanted to serve
Lil because he said he wanted to be a hunter someday
I said don't do that because it's not the right way
I gave him 10 bands, I told him to go away, save that shit
He put a smile on my face, every time I see my cousin he has a smile on his face
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
Money goes in like a plug in the wall
Fucking with the BMG leaves you hostage like a saw
What do you need? I got the raw stupid smooth ass
Hit the stupid raw ass ends with the locking jaw
The package hit you hard, made you have flashbacks
What you have oil you know is gas
I hit you bitch once and then I threw her off the glass
You know I had to go but don't call me Steve Nash
I lost about a pound to the damn feds
Entering money we have the long loaf
Money comes in because money is arranged
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
Money going in, money going out
Millions of dollars make a shit nigga move
Two thousand bucks buy some bad bitch shoes
God knows she has moved
Raw, baw, raw, graw, come back to shit
I treat you like a cow, nigga, you better move
Move
Better move, better move, move it
You have to move (move), you have to move!
When the plug makes the call, know I can move the ball
Nigga, can you flip it all over, can you make a fifty ball?
In the streets I am a magician, call me Quavo John Wall
Sell rolls, not Quan, Roll Latifah said it all
I have to have a gas mask in the kitchen because I cough
Move the job to Memphis, so yell at Dolph
Put the Forgi in the old school, riding the Chevy T-top
Feeling like a DJ, hit 'em with the rerock
Feeling like I'm LOX nigga rerock on block D
Fucking Chi-town niggas on O-block
I fuck the pot, I can make it snow on your block
Nigga was just cooking, that's the reason the stove is hot
Seeing money, in my dreams I had a bank knot
Move, move, move, huh!
Raw, baw, raw, graw, come back to shit
I treat you like a cow, nigga, you better move
Move
Better move, move it
Better move, better move, move it
You have to move (get out), you have to move (move)
You don't have the money on time, my nigga, what is your occupation?
I played with the Muslim, we came up with the [?]
We would never be in cases, never in investigations
I told As-salamu alaykum because my niggas kept it sacred
I feel like Big Meech, I have a hundred million in my vases
I have a thousand niggas with me, they look for you as rewards
Imma imposed a gas tax that moves from the county
Drinking Actavis, it made me sleepy, catching, covering, Maui Waui
I have bricks in the U-haul, I have workers in the mountains
How fast can you count it, my nigga? I don't need to count it
Bricks in Florida, they call me Seminole
I know how to move them, Michael Jackson, I'm a soft criminal
Millions of dollars make a shit nigga move
Move, move, move, huh!
Two thousand bucks buy some bad bitch shoes
God knows she has moved
Get the helicopter out, everyone move
I treat you like a cow, nigga, you better move
Moooooove
Better move, move it
Better move, better move, move it
You have to move (get out), you have to move (move)
You have to move (move), you have to move!
Drinking at Activis, he whips up the job and then I pack it up
100K in the attic, I have the bricks in the cabinet
Although the work is immaculate, I am catching and drying it
That's an intruder in the window, I'm shooting it and then I fly to Bermuda
Pull up with helicopters with coolers inside
I'm catching, I have half a bag but I don't know what to do with it
Fuck a milli, I bet you'll make your bitch loose
They never saw 100,000 because you niggas are new
Quality control that is the label has a solid base
My nigga catching vacancies, we smoke gas like Jamaica
Bentley Musalnne in black and white but I'm not racist
Traveling around the world to get Benjamin's faces
If you're not talking about money, I like myself

Chopper louder than surround sound
It is a secret underground.
Just another day at the Nawfside rolling (rolling)
Riding around trying to shove it in, 2pac all looking at me (2pac)
My young black man hit a 100 gang jugg in the club that was stolen
Young black man still tied by the north side
Gwinnett County Patrol
Trapping on Club Drive, the Migos army got mafia ties
Kick the door a million times
My nigga Westside had to do five
The hood was crying when Pete Gun died
You have to survive, the streets will eat you alive
You said you're tough, your niggas are frauds
I went to the pen and those times were difficult
You niggas are bitches, wear tights
Bitches are mad because I broke their hearts
Beat the pot like it's martial arts
I come from photos
To posters on the block
Keep our song on repeat
Now all we need is 3 microphones and a DJ
3 microphones and a DJ x3
Meet 3 young black men in the north
By the name of Quavo, Offset and Takeoff
Squad opens the trunk and I take out that sawing
Cutomuto has cut your throat, Migos dressed in the cut takes your jaw
I come from bitches looking at me
Brazilians, snow bunnies and I like Dominicans
Gold on my Giuseppe Steppers, red on the bottom of my Christian Louboutins
He used to be juggling, fixing, remixing the plug on the island like Gillegan
The burning block, I can extinguish it
3 microphones 3 microphones 3 black microphones that changed my life
Mom she told me to do well
Now I move around the stage and they pay me, it's 50k on my resume
Now I'm hanging around with the tints of the president on an Escalade
Rocking shows in the cemetery
I told my mom we made it, Harriet Tubman doesn't chain slavery
Play with the water like the marina
3 microphones we don't need a fucking deal
Back in the day, a flamenco DJ Ray G playing Bando
Bitches wanna come and mix
Zonatti Guiseppe surrounded my socks
We came from the photos
Crouching down and dodging the Ray G cops for me Offset stop
Offset never listen had to say a prayer when I got out we got to the top
Cooking the drug will bag like a repeat
You know what i am
Singles mansion
Flipping all these hoes like a spatula
No, you know I don't like any camera (no!)
Your bitch is like an animal that attacks us
She won't leave me alone, she loves the bachelor
Migos, rich young black man, we're some singles
Singles, singles, uh, singles, Migos some singles
Quavo, I'm single
Look at the way I'm throwing myself like a shepherd (I'm hanging around, right?)
I am single
Rockin 'the shows, crushing hoes right after
I got your bitches working, calling me teacher
It came from below and now I have guala
Graduated, now a black is a bachelor
Turning your ho like a spatula
Don't get me wrong, I'm still making spatulas
Migos we don't like cameras
We discovered that we can make millions with it
So we start flexing as singles
Came from hiding money on the roof
Black youth, why don't you want to be single?
Came from kicking doors, juugin 'plug for bows
And now we are making trips to Africa, Africa
Niggas say they're entrepreneurs
I don't see the millions you chase
Black and white statistics, what do you do?
Top the charts every time we launch a new one
Singles mansion
Flipping all these hoes like a spatula
No, you know I don't like any camera (no!)
Your bitch is like an animal that attacks us
She won't leave me alone, she loves the bachelor
Migos, rich young black man, we're some singles
Singles, singles, singles, ooh singles
Singles, singles, uh, singles, Migos some singles
Whippin 'the dope, with the Terminator breaking the spatula
Take the package and then I wrap it and then I pack it
If I take a cup, I'll take a private jet to Canada
Promoters don't have my money, I'm killing your manager
Fuck my nigga, we shoot innocent bystanders
Stop with choppas and have a nigga call the ambulance
Drinking at Actavis and I'm rolling cannabis
Hoes running down the lobby geekin 'up and her wet panties
I had a Cuban and Rolex link before the rap shit
I only adapt to the trap because that's my habitat
I'm on the corner catching work like a corner
Running to the money, my nigga, I think I'm a broker
Niggas still catch rooms, get them to give up their room
Forty pointers in my Breitling, oh that's what you're looking at?
Singles mansion
Flipping all these hoes like a spatula
No, you know I don't like any camera (no!)
Your bitch is like an animal that attacks us
She won't leave me alone, she loves the bachelor
Migos, rich young black man, we're some singles
Singles, singles, uh, singles, Migos some singles
She watches my diamonds hallucinating in mushrooms
Hold a break nigga and hit your head with a broom
I have the bird that flies like caterpillars out of the cocoons
Stop at the Bentley, think you've seen a damn Jeeper Creeper
I got that 9 on my waist like a two-way beeper
I am single, I have an oil factory in Africa
Trapper turned into rapper then rapper turned into a massacre
Then beat a nigga, trample on a nigga, I ain't gonna take into account
From the beginning, these bitches weren't shit, they ate the apple
Had an arrest warrant with the sack, the police tried to deal
Green Bay with the green, seal it in a vacuum, I'm a Packer
Just because you rap about it, you're not a trapper
Singles mansion
Flipping all these hoes like a spatula
No, you know I don't like any camera (no!)
Your bitch is like an animal that attacks us
Singles, singles, singles, ooh singles
Singles, singles, uh, singles, Migos some singles

You know, rich young niggas
You know, we've never had old money
We have a lot of new money, haha
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
What do you want a whole bag or half a bag?
I need cash, I need cheese, nigga, I need all my racks
Running away from homework, silver block with labels
I have a stinky pack of kush that smells like garbage
Whisk it on the stove and then cool it with the fan
Addicted to the whole bag can not even serve a gram
And I'm doing it for my niggas who's locked in the beat
Price labels on the bag, in the glass bathrooms.
Foreign Plug Overseas, Get My Trinidad Job
I have gas pumps like I'm in Afghanistan
And I'm posted on an island, you can call me Gilligan
On the side wrap packages in Saran
Some of the bricks are white, some of them are toasted
Posted on the block with a whole bag of shit
12 pull up, everyone ran
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
Quarter bag, half bag, I need everything
Red and white, lift the lamb, candy cane
Damn, the racks are too heavy, I need a cane
Two Styrofoam filled, I'm drinking on Wayne
Bad foreign bitch in my crew, she came from Spain
On the phone catching the game while I put on my brain
Yeah he says he wants that white but the drama came
Make the job disappear, call him David Blaine
Walk around girl on my hip, John Wayne
Stop at the dumpster, Lebron James
10 chains on my neck, but I'm not a slave
Batman Coupe, stop at the Batcave
Old money on me so they call me OJs
Run away with the set as OJ
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
I have the bag on my back like a soldier
Gucci bag and it's a roller
And it was filled with the doja
I leaned on my glass without Foldgers
And I stopped in a Rover
And I hit hoes like Sammie, not Sosa
No coca - aina, no claim, travel, no visa
I make a hurricane, not FEMA
.36 hold it like a girl
And I stopped at the projector
And I have mass, Little Caesars
The block is so hot that it gives you a fever
I have beans, lean, gas
Niggas better come with that money
The Gucci bag came with the flag
Hell yeah I just fucked my team
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag
Half bag, whole bag, half bag, whole bag
Half bag, whole bag with price tag

Since my dad left, mom taught me "son, do it right"
50 niggas to my left, 50 niggas to my right
50 chickens come per day, 50 chickens come per night
When I spank my job today, they found your ass tonight
All my niggas up, you know they went on sight

How are you going big?
How are you going big?
How are you going big?
I can't go big
I can't go big
I can't go big

Wassup, Pablo? What is poppin '?
I need them, I want it
I had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (skrt, skrt, skrt)
I can't fuck you niggas, I'm sorry (no way)
I used to catch them birds, now I fly like a bird
(I have them, who needs them)
(Come on, come on now)
B-b-birds
(Come on, come on, come get them right now)
Birds
Quavo!
Just hit my phone if you want a bird
You can get a remix
You can get a full service (service)
We close and now I can face you
Young nigga, that's my word (word)
Walk on the side, look at all those birds (birds)
I don't have to undo
Just me and Willie Mac, Offset
Shoutout Sunday (Sunday)
The judge dropped the charge and I thank the Lord (thank you)
This is why I take this microphone and get tough
I had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (skrt, skrt, skrt)
I can't fuck you niggas, I'm sorry (no way)
I used to catch them birds, now I fly like a bird
(I have them, who needs them)
(Come on, come on now)
B-b-birds
Birds
Make up for!
I just got the word (hello?), I just got the birds
Shabba classifies the gold, just kick it with Ferg
Do you think you're bothering me? Run away with your bird
Charles Barkley, I have that broccoli
Fucking these bitches committing adultery
Trap full of babies like a primary
Never trust a broad (no)
I'm putting my trust in God
I have birds, I have chickens, I have seagulls
Too many birds, my weapon is an eagle (birds)
When I talk about birds, I'm talking about a kilo (kilo)
I had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (skrt, skrt, skrt)
I'm flying too far, I spread my wings and soar
I used to catch them birds, now I fly like a bird
(I have them, who needs them)
Birds B
B-b-birds
Birds
Take off!
The plug just hit my phone for some Funyuns, I want an onion
Exotic crocodile skin Martens, call me Dundee
Carlito for a hundred, he gave my mom around 50
I am an OG in my neighborhood, not Aretha, highly respected
I see hawks daily, take off Arthur Blank
Beat chickens in the kitchen, catch the smell of septic tank
All black and gold, talking about jewelry, not the sink
My plug Carlito, he can't speak no English
All he knows is "walk"
I have sides for the L-O
State to state, no real estate
I had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari (skrt, skrt, skrt)
I can't fuck you niggas, I'm sorry (no way)
I'm flying too far, I spread my wings and soar
I used to catch them birds, now I fly like a bird
(I have them, who needs them)
Birds B
(Come on, come on now)
B-b-birds
(Come on, come on, come get them right now)
Birds
Oh my
Go, go, oh
50 bitches in the lobby
I told them not to tell anyone
Lil mom keeps asking "who's Scottish?"
I got bitches on bitches, they lick your body
Lick it off your body
Lick it off your body
Lick it off your body
Lil mom keeps asking "who's Scottish?"
I had to tell them what Molly is
Got bitches on bitches, lick it off your body
Haah, look at the bitches, they lick
Haah, popping the molly, they kiss
Haah, I came out of nowhere, I wanted a Benz
Woah, he made me a milli and jumped on a lamb '
Oh, shorty is about to get fucked in a rental
Oh, I pay for the taxi, I pay for dinner
Oh, I counted 10,000 in a year
10,000 feet in the air
You see the image is clear
Nigga we are here
Haah, whip game, right (?)
Haah, you bought 100 chains for $ 100
Hey I have more diamonds than him
You can't talk about Moolah
I'm a rapper and shit
Nigga we do it
Lil mom keeps asking "who's Scottish?"
I got bitches on bitches, they lick your body
Lick it off your body
Lick it off your body
Lil mom keeps asking "who's Scottish?"
I had to tell them what Molly is
Got bitches on bitches, lick it off your body
Got bitches on bitches, lick it off your body
Look at them bitches, they look at each other
Two bitches from France, fight on my blankets
When I pass the molly to you, I want you to lick it off his body
Sorry for yelling but I'm a gamer but I'm not Bell Ami
I stop with the double cup of Actavis, my pimp is good with that Hennessy
When I became a young millionaire, people remind me
50 bitches in the lobby
I told them not to tell anyone
Lil mom keeps asking "who's Scottish?"
I told them it's Molly
Lick it off your body
Lick it off your body
Lil mom keeps asking "who's Scottish?"
Got bitches on bitches, lick it off your body
Got bitches on bitches, lick it off your body
She cooks lobster (?) Romas (?)
She licks the molly, taking that dad is sour
My diamonds are wet, someone bring a towel
I told them it's Molly
I got bitches on bitches, they lick your body
Lick it off your body
Lil mom keeps asking "who's Scottish?"
Licking her body
Licking the molly
Shawty so hot she could bang in the lobby
But don't tell anyone, don't tell anyone
I blew up a brick, try to buy me a Bugatti
I could crash a bitch on the pilot
Running the lobby, I got bitches in scottie
That Scotsman is molly, lick it off his body
Pick up the Audi, (?) Kawasaki, dressed in a nickel body
I love my bitches like my marijuana, I have to be exotic, I come from the tropics
Pocket rocket, I keep it in my pocket
Call it Houston Rockets, take 'em like a psychic
Bop-bop-brhh
50 bitches in the lobby
I told them it's Molly
I got bitches on bitches, they lick your body
Lick it off your body
Lick it off your body
Lil mom keeps asking "who's Scottish?"
I had to tell them what Molly is
Got bitches on bitches, lick it off your body
Got bitches on bitches, lick it off your body

Do you want half or all?
Are you turning gold or are you keeping the chrome?
Maybach music
Pussy niggas wanna see you dead
Cause they niggas pussy never see the bread
Black bottles and gold chains.
Ho swallowing all my name (Rozay)
I got some niggas that will slide by me
Left hand for Styrofoam
I gave my shine a student loan
That bitch's mouth made the roll of honor
Down to get the job done, black, no gloves
I just got 2 birds from the old man
I always look for the old man
Belaire, my fridge
I ate your bitch at the table (woo)
Black bottles and gold chains (huh)
Do you want half or all?
Are you going hard or are you going home?
My mom told me to get money and stay alive (mom)
I can't make the deal, I think it has a cable
Throwing a hard ball and hitting it, call them Mark McGwire
I will meet Pelé Migo, that's my that
He never has a private jet, but he works on the slopes
My doll lashes the magic, Quavo Hardaway
3,000 birds in the air, I call him Andre
It was nothing, I became something, these bitches want me
I come from the side, many bags, but there are no groceries
Pull up on the outside, that's the trunk where the engine is located
Bottles in that VIP, get the camera out, Spike Lee
Do you want half or all?
Are you turning gold or are you keeping the chrome?
(Take off!)
Looking at my Breitling, he has VS-1 stones
Lately many of you niggas have been rocker rhinestones
Talking about you on the block, Macaulay Culkin, home alone
Walking with that bag, no 6, nigga walking with a 50
It's the Migo gang, tag quality control, fuck niggas you better get it
After my show, I'm on your nigga autograph bitch breasts
For the price of fame and never double
Act hard behind the internet
A nigga taking chains I must
24k on my feet
My Maison Margiela's, rose gold
Catching and drying, I catch in rain, sleet or snow
Black bottles and gold chains.
Do you want half or all?
Are you going hard or are you going home?
Are you turning gold or are you keeping the chrome?
Dope de alala, I have to keep 9 miles
Finessin 'the plug for the job
I cross it, without dribbling
Sippin 'Rose after the day I had a court date
I tried to fuck lil mom, I really don't like foreplay
I hit him in the mouth, he thought he had a damn toothache
Most of you niggas are too fake
They watch a nigga like Blu-Ray
You're talking about that hit, but you can't be from the kitchen
Spanking Alicia Keys
You say you have a lot of money
But really your money is sesame seeds
I have this bitch named Valerie, she brings me bricks from Sicily
My neck is flooded and my double cup is muddy
The streets made me a villain, that bowl, I made a million
Black bottles and gold chains.
Do you want half or all?
Are you going hard or are you going home?
Are you turning gold or are you keeping the chrome?
Black bottles and gold chains.
Carrying cocaine gold
Boil kilo in the pot
'Another drug dealer in the car lot
Ayy let me hear that ho Jeff
Official Tishial (what?)
I fucked that bitch, I can't miss her
Your bitch in the gang let the whistle blow
I bought the Rolls, this is not a rental
I gave her a bag, that bitch is a winner (bag)
She wanted steak, she got chicken dinner
You got it? Then show the cash (racks)
Money comes fast, like the script
So I have to blow up the bag (what?)
That bitch is bad
She let me crush her on me like shoulder pads
Playing with the check
Young nigga imma blow the racks (racks!)
Spend a total of 100 nigga imma go do it ...
I cut too deep, he got to sew
Then go and change a new Bentley color
Surround the frames, John Lennon
How much pay? Take care of your business (cash)
Release all my children who were sentenced (sentenced!)
If they don't, we're going to shoot the lieutenant (bow!)
My proud family, not Penny (proud!)
My dog collar has VV
I don't feel sorry for the niggas without mercy (nah)
Celebrate with the gang
Order singles and put them on titties (Take off!)
Official Tishial, triple call
'Tryna gets a 20 out of that nigga (twenty!)
She wants the purple pickle on the mink for the winter
I drive the scrolls [???]
Baguette the Patek it's cold
You touch my wrist and you could shake (ice)
Serial kill them (kill them!)
Your backend became minimal, pitiful
Once the condition is critical (critical)
Migo gang come on digital (come on!)
Turn on our TV (why?)
My mom just said she sees me (mom!)
The boys say it's Eliantte, they don't need glass.
And when it's smoke
You realize that we who come
Watch them niggas starving because they don't eat (starve)
I put my doll in the pot which is a man [?]
Then I start to hit (come on)
Every day my bitch b-day
Park the car, put it on the highway (let's go)
The only way I'm living expensive
They think I'm going to tip them
I have completely different colors like Skittles (come on)
Park my new shit and get on a rental (slide)
You screwed up my vibe, I could spin it
All my VV diamonds I'm not kidding (bling)
How did you get on television with that gun?
Migos and Rich, many vibes want to eat on my cock
Bitch I'm tired I ended up beating six (come on)
I'm gonna live, I put some Bop on that shit (Bop)
Platinum plates, that little black is activated
I stop only with the ratchet (no flop)
'As soon as that nigga falls, automatic
Fuck and Pop, Michael Jackson (Pop Star)
Yah!
Migos in the building
Young Rich Nigga Fuck, Man
Fuck wrong with these niggas, man?
Come on!
I bitch wanna fuck the squad
Because she sees exotic cars
Those niggas hate your boy
Arco, arco, gruow, gruow
We have body parts
I got niggas who'll get you a food ticket
I know niggas who remix, remix all the chicken
I gotta see them smuggling snake niggas
Young rich black man
I'm walking with the rocket
I'm not even going to touch you, I'll let my man catch you
Remember me hitting the juugs and licks, ducking and dodging the police
I feel like 2Pac, it's me against the world and I can't be stopped.
I bitch wanna fuck the squad
Because she sees exotic cars
Those niggas hate your boy
Arco, arco, gruow, gruow
We have body parts
Young Rich Black Man Tries To See A Milli
I got niggas who'll get you a food ticket
I know niggas who remix, remix all the chicken
I feel like the president, Richard Nixon
Gruow, gruow, gruow we have body parts
Call me Pastor Takeoff, healing niggas Peter Popoff
I'm A1 nigga without meat sauce
Baking the little birds, I'm baking
I hide body parts like I'm Jeffrey Dahmer
A living legend, Ronald McDonald
My wrist terminator, but I'm not Arnold
Football Xans, I call them Hey Arnold
I bitch wanna fuck the squad
Because she sees exotic cars
Young Rich Black Man Tries To See A Milli
I know niggas who remix, remix all the chicken
I feel like the president, Richard Nixon
Fuck talking nigga hit them with extensions
Throw them in the river, now the nigga is missing
Fuck nigga stumbling, not paying attention
I hit them with semis, don't even see it
Clear the whole scene and I won't leave any witnesses
The only people I forgive are the children.
Dissecting you niggas, take off your body parts
Karate cuts that nigga like it's martial arts
Put the black pussy in a milk carton
Don't roll the black die, you risk your life
I'm pouring lean on your grave
I shoot him the bullet, he catches her like Jerry Rice
Ugh, fuck a bitch because she's Thug Life
Smoke well because my plug is ok
200k sold on my debut release
200 criminals locked up from the team
Popping 200 bottles on launch day
Yes, I am deceased, which means that I am attacking all these leaves
Get rich or die trying to keep that on repeat
And all these bitches are trying to attack me
And I fuck all of them, I have 2 cell phones, none of them can call me
I don't know what language you speak
Every time you see us we get bigger and bigger
I don't understand the jargon
Every time you see us, we get richer and richer
Every time you see us, we get richer and richer
Every time we see you, you get broker and broker
Brokanese, do you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, do you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, do you speak Brokanese
On your knees you speak brokanese
Brokanese, Brokanese
Speaking of Brokanese, I took your dog and broke her knees.
Brokanese, Brokanese
You're speaking in Brokanese like: Can I have a dollar please?
I am Hercules, you are Brokales
Extortion we want it so bring me that money
WWE, jabronies boys, GLAW! GLAW! GLAW!
I come with the helicopter feeling like Tony
You niggas are cloning, copy me
Then you look at us, like you haven't done anything wrong
You have the nerve to bite the loot, then try to get a song
Don't fuck nigga, let's not rock like that
This is how niggas screw up like this
If you want to earn millions, join independent quality control
Every time you see us, we get richer and richer
Every time we see you, you get broker and broker
Every time you see us, we get richer and richer
Every time we see you, you get broker and broker
Brokanese, do you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, do you speak Brokanese
On your knees you speak brokanese
"Bon appétit", it's time to eat
Beat the pot like a boxing bob nigga and knit
A whole thing
I do not speak your language because you are speaking Brokanese
You broke on your knees
Hold freeze
You don't have money in your pocket, don't talk to me
Whippin 'the Anna Nicole and Lindsay
No days off, daily payday
My diamonds look like KK (white)
You broke up and asked for favors
Young black I am 40 acres
The mansion is so big that I don't speak to anyone
I have no neighbors
My neck is cold like a glacier
I caught her, you should have saved her
We are playing, you are not a player
Front row, on the Lakers' court
Every time you see us, we get richer and richer
Every time we see you, you get broker and broker
Brokanese, do you speak Brokanese
I never play the piano but I flog with many keys
Catching and covering the fish
Talking to my plug, Jackie Chan in Japanese
Private jet to Belize, smoking OG Christmas trees
I don't have a dollar, you're so brokanese
You need to stack that broccoli
I'm Mr. Miyagi and that's why you copy me
A nigga still on the block
Selling them rooms and mentioning my niggas have been treating it
I travel abroad, water whip in the Bahamas
In Australia I am the crocodile hunter.
In Africa in the jungle
Every time you see us, we get richer and richer
Every time we see you, you get broker and broker
Every time you see us, we get richer and richer
Every time we see you, you get broker and broker
Brokanese, do you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, do you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, do you speak Brokanese
On your knees you speak brokanese

That black burned
You remember he came out and said that shit man
I don't give a shit about nigga's feelings
So I'm completely black, like I'm John Wick
Open the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That's a life sentence, a quarter mill on my wrist (damn)
That black burned
That black burned
On a highway with a hundred pounds
That black burned
Young nigga catches her mom's house
That black burned
That black burned
Burned
Damn that burnt nigga
Twelve have him in for questioning
But it burned, it's not singing
If they ever find a fucking puncher
Walk by turning your fingers
But he's still in the kitchen and churning the pot.
Seeing what the drug Kurt Angles looks like
In the kitchen and I'm cooking Topanga
I really don't fuck with strangers
If you want a hunnid we can fix it
No refunds, so it changes
You can test the drug with your little finger
Now it feels like a Power Ranger
I look like a chameleon in a trap
I don't give a shit about nigga's feelings
I have the helicopter for the victims.
Mumma told me to go kill them
So I'm completely black, like I'm John Wick
Open the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That black burned
That black burned
On a highway with a hundred pounds
Young nigga catches her mom's house
That black burned
Damn that burnt nigga
The nigga walking with a dirty stick
Burnt he looks sick
Stealing, fixing everything in sight
Your brother just charged for a brick
He sent the little bitch on a journey
Mom preaching like a reverend
He a rookie wants to be a veteran
And your cheating game is excellence
He likes Hannah Montana's boot
The young black man went out like he was blowing out the candles
No ski mask has a bag, but she said fuck the cameras
Walking with a dirty stick like an antenna
I don't give a shit about nigga's feelings
I have the helicopter for the victims.
So I'm completely black, like I'm John Wick
Open the trunk, it's a brick and a stick
That's a life sentence, I caught a mill on my wrist (damn)
That black burned
Burned
That black burned
On a highway with a hundred pounds
That black burned
Young nigga catches her mom's house
That black burned
That black burned
Burned

Standing in the trap, it's been a long day
Thinking of putting a lock on my wrist and AK
Now she is no longer crying because we have a higher step
I can do a Tuesday, go up like a Saturday
I don't play where fools play, you must be from another state
Molly, your girl's plate, you take her to dinner
Dabbing in Raf Simmons, yes, seen the huncho every day
Ricki Lake, wrapped, came from Kuwait
Every day, every day, a young black man looking for bae
I have a bitch with Jimmy and she does what Huncho says
Her boyfriend wants to be me because I keep that gangster-style shit
I have to leave you
Oh man, these niggas come out sad

I'm going to crush you but we don't lie down

From the nawf, bitch, you know where we are from
I think it's sweet and we pull out a drum
You can be rich and a tramp
I want everything, not something
She fucking for fame, for some '
So I just gave him the money
Hoes In My House As Hugh Heffner
But I will kill the rabbits
She is going crazy, talk about my principal
I have to leave you
Oh man, these niggas come out sad
I'm telling you, I can't go wrong
No, especially about that bitch
I will not leave sad
I will not leave sad
'Especially about that bitch
I can not leave sad

'Especially about that bitch
(Take off!)
I can't go out, sad for no bitch
Who I take off never mad at any bitch
Depressed, I need to get something off my chest
She left me crazy on her chest, you still arrest that bitch
Bad, yeah, little mom, you let her catch Jag and crash
That goes sad
You took it on a date with dad
The question is boy, did you break up?
Been strong a week and a half
And everything you can give that bitch (she cheated on you)
Aw man, damn, these niggas come out sad
Wifin 'ho's up, there ain't no nigga done
Smash, fist, but you can pass, ignore but cannot erase the past
He cheated on you once, it's his fault, if he cheats on you twice it's your butt
I have to leave you
Oh man, these niggas come out sad
I will not leave sad
I will not leave sad
I will not leave sad
I can not leave sad
I can not leave sad
I can not leave sad
'Especially about that bitch

They probably thought this shit was going to stop, huh?
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo returns to the gang, it's all three
You better hide where your mom is (mom!)
And she said you can't have company (no!)
Minor setback for a major return
Minor setback for a major return
Minor setback for a major return
You thought a nigga was going to fall (fall!)
Hahaha, hell no!
Hit them witty, grab it, look at my dab
Minor setback for a major return

Quavo
Case closed, we can stop the duckling
I went and did the show at Georgia Southern
Had a couple of grams, large amounts of cash
We arrived very late, but they said to arrive early
The other truck had Rich and Murk inside
I got to the show, 12 deeper than 30
That's when i knew someone was working
We're the only niggas in the back
I had to give my big 12 my fucking strap
What will I do with my backpack?
Damn I put that shit in my bag
12 looking at us, crazy
Cause we hit and our pants sag
While we're on stage, dancing the dab
12 looking in the van, damn
They locked up my driver, damn it
We left the stage
Then he walked through the locker room, we were handcuffed
Wait, there is no conversation, there is no discussion
They threw us in the rice van (rice!)
Shit, we all said "Fuck it"
Whatever happens God's plans
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo returns to the gang, it's all three

Minor setback for a major return
Minor setback for a major return
Minor setback for a major return
Make up for!
Denying my bond over and over
We kept it solid, we didn't bend it or bend it
I had to beat a nigga trying to steal my Benz
My diamonds will kick like Ryu and Ken
If I had the chance I'd jump the fence
I sat in my box, read a book while I vent
I felt I had lost it, but I got it back
She arches her back at the back of my hatch
I swear to the Lord that I will not return
Back on the road, 80 thousand, we need that
Takeoff gave a hunnit, told me to relax
Sleep with one eye open, Silver without patch (see you!)
They prepared us knowing that we kept the straps
You are not a boss because it is something you lack
Smoking with gas, breathing like Toni Brax
Back to the side and back to the trap
I got down on my knees and asked God to help me
Acting like I don't know you like I have amnesia
Portraits in my Mona Lisa mansion
My colleagues beg me like Felicia
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo returns to the gang, it's all three
You better hide where your mom is (mom!)
And she said you can't have company (no!)

Muddy trouble on the way to Georgia Southern
He served me a four and got out of it
I tried to hit a nigger over the head with so many charges
When I got to the show I woke up, I knew nothing
All I saw was police, sheriffs, and drug agents
I took that, zipped it up, and then got the TEC
And I ordered the Ozium because it was moldy (spray!)
But it's too late for everything that causes them to see
My kitty is in my pants, I still smell cookies
No, this is not a wrap, but I smell what they cook
When I was on stage, I didn't feel a thing
That they were behind me plotting, trying to catch me
If I knew then what a black man had seen
I had a zipper on my net when I got stuck
Looking because there were no cameras around
Autistic when it comes to questioning the sound
Not talking so whatever you found
But you can't find shit, nigga, I'm not a clown
Searching so hard, I left something drunk on the floor
Fuck all that shit, my nigga is out of the hit
Nah really, take off!
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo returns to the gang, it's all three
You better hide where your mom is (mom!)
And she said you can't have company (no!)

Hold that drug lil bitch bae don't panic
Luxurious

I used to make J go crazy
Looking at my life right now, this exceptional shit
I took advantage of many opportunities
Remembering in my mansion

Fifty bands in the suitcase
That's the only nigga that threw 10k at me
We were so hot we could sizzle
You think my life was an enigma
I do this shit for my children
We used to kick doors and everything
Now we fuck hoes and ball

You couldn't walk a mile on my damn feet
I want to go out, so I took the damn plea
I took a risk
I have a bitch in France
Call my phone when I land
She is in love with my money
Send my shooter attack

Christian Louboutin does not match
Grab the forty, blow your hat

Young nigga taking risks
Running around with plays like I'm calling Madden

These bitches are gone and their panties are still falling
Smells like a pound while you're on campus
They hated us so they banned us

So nigga I have nothing to sell
The difference between you nigga and me
Look at the drip, if my niggas catch them they won't tell
Born to fetch him, mom raised me well
You only have one chance, I have to give them hell
I get excited when it arrives in the mail
Something dark white, something pale
The first time I saw him, young nigga, he really had butterflies
I bought my dog a bag because she's crying
Cut my side, she was lying
I've licked a hundred times
Without money, that's a bad day.
P pistol died in Domingo's face
Free Offset, caught another case, damn
It seems like every time we're getting to the cake
Life casts a black maze
Sack running towards money every day
I'm on the block like Orlando Pace
One hundred thousand in the briefcase
A hundred thousand in my [?] Safe
My daughter hit my phone and said she wanted Chanel
My friend came to bless me with a hundred bales
My G says I'm not going to jail
My friend hit my line, got a hundred bales
My friend hit my line, got a hundred bales
My friend hit my line, got a hundred bales
Yes that's my clientele
Call my line, these niggas drop dime
Rollie overloaded, I can't tell the time
I'm not handcuffing these bitches, hell, they're not mine
You won't see me with nines and I'll only fuck dime
These black asses have no rhyme
Break an entire brick and put it in the trap
I used to capitalize them, I changed it to rap
Ahead of these niggas pussy for a turn
I'm walking in this rhythm like I'm running trap
Your bitch is a weirdo and her head in my lap
My diamonds are as rocky as if I were with A $ AP
My daughter keeps calling and she loves Chanel
They weren't in the trap and I know these niggas are going to say
My friend is calling and he is serving me bales
Got niggas down the road serving them L
Poppin 'mollies put me high as a shell
I'm in the Maserati, I have no air
I'm leaving with Thugger like Santa Claus with L
I'm totin 'uzi, middle fingers up to 12
Never lie down and I'm giving these niggas the pussy
My friend came to bless me with a hundred bales
I got off the scale, whip that fish and climb
My G says I'm not going to jail
My friend hit my line, got a hundred bales
My friend hit my line, got a hundred bales
My friend hit my line, got a hundred bales
Yes that's my clientele
Then I blew the extras, I fucked the digits
I was greenish green like a damn cricket
These niggas fall, these niggas fall
You play with them, you know they stain you
You don't need a lawyer because they could change you
You never heard that, stupid nigga
Leave that leash alone, when did you become a murderer?
Your show becomes as slow as a damn caterpillar
When I sprayed some shit, don't you go black
My house is big, I have to map it black
Hypnotize, until you hypnotize
I have white semolina, this is not rice
I can hide them, chain gangs for some price
My daughter hit my phone and said she wanted Chanel
My friend came to bless me with a hundred bales
I got off the scale, whip that fish and climb
My friend hit my line, got a hundred bales
My friend hit my line, got a hundred bales
My friend hit my line, got a hundred bales

Audi R8 creepin ', like a tarantula (Audi)
Making spectacular moves
Hitting the dope with the stick and it's magic (hit it)
I set up the lock and it's epic (set it up)
Bank of America walk log
I can't fuck with you niggas, too skeptical
Undercover, you work with the feds (huh?)
Raise the plug so I can go pick up some
Smuggling, smuggling, smuggling
Smuggling, smuggling, smuggling
Trap house, it doesn't even matter, or the side, everyone cooks it
Smuggling
Narcotic, narcotic, narcotic
Dope boys now on the block
Increasing the numbers, the young black man doesn't need a wallet
Ooh, listen to the meditation of your voice
Ooh, I love the movements he's making
Ooh, she turns me on with her conversation
She turns me on with her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turns me on with her conversation
Quavo
I'm touching her, rubbing Benjamins all over her body
I'm looking directly at her, I said, 'Come here.'
She said she can't wait to blow it up
I said, 'Go blow it up'
So she told me to just wake her up, that tomorrow I'd be free
No i can't go i have a show 50k tomorrow
Look at my face, girl, I'm hungry
Makin 'her eggs 8 A.M. in the morning'
You know she was naked, that's how she came in and did it
I want to lock her up, I want to lock her up like slavery
Black and Asian what combination
She turns me on with her conversation
Ooh, listen to the meditation of your voice
Ooh, I love the movements he's making
Ooh, she turns me on with her conversation
She turns me on with her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turns me on with her conversation

Banging her ass and I'm grabbing her tits
Can you handle it after the young black man handled that?
Roll, roll, yeah, roll
I don't like to drink, baby, take it all
Start, fifty percent in the trunk, that's a truck
The talks will not be in a Maybach
Conversations want temperature, baby, lie down
No honey we have to have safe sex
She's fine and I'm singing her blues
I know she has some potential
Little mom, I know she gave away
So I bought him a Bentley at Christmas
Got on Louboutins, she got on Louboutins
I turned your bitch and I know it's unfortunate
Perfect, heaven sent, lil 'mom got the whole package
Ooh, listen to the meditation of your voice
Ooh, I love the movements he's making

Cut off the top of the Lamborghini, coolin '
I have to go abroad, I'm about to chase him
You got your bitch and her friend making movies
Keep the money on the wall, I can't find the tool
Microwave, watch it cool, bake
Me and BMG always flex
When it comes to bands, I need mine.
Nigga, the clock, you can't see the time because of the big rocks
Get the money, twist it and stretch it like botox
Now my pockets look fat like Norbit
Bitch looking at me, you need a camera to record me
Too much money for me, they just put me on the fortune list
Your bitch chooses me now, she runs, that's unfortunate
I do shit

No party, two foreign hoes in my Maserati
Black belts wrapped around my money like I knew karate
Looking at the money every day like I can't see anyone

Two foreign bitches and they go down to make a movie
Call me Bob the Builder, yeah, I'll take the tool
Bad bitches in the kitchen with pots and pans
Me and the scale in the living room weighing grams
The packages I'm going to wrap so they don't smell it
Cut off the top of the Lamborghini, coolin '
I have to go abroad, I'm about to chase him
You got your bitch and her friend making movies
Keep the money on the wall, I can't find the tool
Collect the money every day, wake up

I told you in the juug season that I'm playing for no reason
I have to take care of your partner because your partner is a police officer
Charge four cars without leases
I keep a cash visa, I have loot, I love it
Two foreign bitches don't speak English
Get them note C, black friend, everything we do is illegal
And my people are a mine, so I'm playing just to feed them
Cut off the top of the Lamborghini, coolin '

I put the bitch in the boat by the shore
I fucked your bitch, when she calls I ignore her
The sold out shows went to Atlanta, Dora
If I lose it, fuck it, buy more water
I'm ahead, I bought a portal
I see a brick cross the border
I took her phone because she's a recorder
Quavo Capone, I give you a tutorial
I'm the best you've ever witnessed, this shit is historical
Me and Nast talking mils
Buffaloes in my team
Put the drug on the beam
That's the honest shit i've seen
Because the scales tell the truth
Big chopper, that's a whopper
But instead I bought a Benz
Then design the engine like doctors
I heard it was a crime stopper
I heard it was a crime stopper
He grew up to be a copper
Copper and thieves, copper and thieves
Copper and thieves, copper and thieves
Do you want to play? Do you want to play?
Cops and robbers
I put my ho on the mission, she fucked it up, she looked in her pocket
Where's my ski? I'm going to have to kill them, I must have forgotten
Go get the F&N, screw it, screw it, I kill you in silence
Wait, I thought he was straight, so why does he keep yelling and yelling?
Give it a lick a Tec and a carbon
Write your name with the permanent marker
Offset for president, vote me in office
I'm moving from drug from Dakota to Boston
As a gangster when you graduated from law school?
Be careful with your partner, he also works with the law
Fuck, knock him out, I hate having lost you
When I beat nigga I tried to file a lawsuit
That's the kind of shit that a copper is going to do
I pray for your life as a hostage what will you do
I'm pimpin 'your bitch in Las Vegas prostitution
Stealing niggas, fuck it, so I'm shooting
If I accidentally rob you, call Ken Nugent
Qua 'rock that nigga thought he was a bookmaker
Head over to Somalian, cook some cookies
Do you want to play? Do you want to play?
Cops and robbers
Coppers, thieves, gangsters, locusts
Audi R8, without charger
Private jet at Pearl Harbor
Going up I was a thief
If the wrapper was worth it, we stole from you
I can't fuck with these niggas, they fake, hate, write statements in permanent markers
Money comes back like karma
Diamonds, bitten, piranhas
Make that bitch work, Rihanna
Not Tarzan, but the jungle that I conquer
Run with that job, don't waste time
Steal a nigga like he's Curtis Snow
But move like it's Barrack Obama
Taking adventure trips, Jumanji, hiding money in the dungeon
The difference between us downstairs, I'm going for it and you puntin '
After fucking her the first round, tell that bitch not to touch me
Bad but busty bitch, she'll take care of me
Kick in the door, nigga, run, make a move and get ugly
What do they say? The police are coming, nigga the fuck called me to the police
Copper and thieves, copper and thieves
Cops and robbers
Do you want to play? Do you want to play?
Copper and thieves, copper and thieves
Cops and robbers

Stealing my flow, hey, I don't even have a hook!
You niggas, you know, no hook, niggas, you know you're stealing my flow
Everybody knows that a fucking nigger doesn't rap like that man
TAKE OFF!
Rich young nigga just 19 years old and you better recognize me (I'm only 19!)
Fuck, nigga, spitting and rapping like that without Migos consent, I want to apologize
Labels keep talking, critics keep writing and
I think it's time for extortion
Or kill you babies, abortion (Kidnap you niggas, my Migos will torture you)
These fucked niggas stole so much damn booty, they might as well sell it
QC the label! (QC) Solid foundation!
Young nigga on the block with work in the sun comes up

They copy the name, they copy the gang, they copy the lingo (they copy my name)
Versace, Versace we brought that shit back and you niggas are lame (Versace copy)
We got some young niggas who signed without a label
My team is so involved in the club that your fans and your people don't notice you.
All my niggas have diamonds, they look like a photo shoot
I stop at the valet, the Audi has a soft top but my hood is bulletproof
And now they want jugg and finessin '
Now they wanna 'sace the necklace
At first we did not expect it and now we wait for it
I am thanking God for the blessing (for not having a rat in my session)
I know this game is dirty Smith and Wesson
Which of my cars should I drive today? I do not know
(They are all foreigners)
Which of my hoes should I fuck today? I do not know

Young nigga I'm for sale
Give them hell!
Put a nigger on a mission, the young nigga won't fail
Never catch, never limit, never been in a test
You with that, I with that, the holes begin to spit
These niggas tremble like Diddy
I have to pay to catch my block, extortion
80 percent of your handsome
It's no lie, Versace, got me a fortune
Nigga's remedy, which sounds like Radio
They niggas don't talk just throwin 'those cards
Dunk a nigga, Vince Carter

Quavo:
Feeling like John Ghotti, bricks in Da Rari
All my niggas killas, bringing guns to the party
I'm kicking it with the vato, catching and wrapping the kilo
Kicking it with mine, counting the weights
Sippin on lean I'm losing my mind, The Lord is giving me many signs
From a young black I am seeing my brother
I'm walking and now I'm nine
I don't love the pussy, you niggas are newbies, I'm smoking cookies with my pockets in snookie
Pull up on the tips and the tramps run out I'm dancing like Lamar odom
Real cheating niggas get money, pick up the phone when it's money
Sellin dem simulated bricks
Wrapping that job up like a mummy
Sell that coco nocolo, the plug is b Costa Nostra
2'Brown:
Those of us who dodged the FBI, those of us who fell on number 4
Mix with water and then heat, beat with the fork
Mix it with the coke, find me at the store
I have that gun tucked into my Gucci belt, it works with the water like micheal phelps
Give me the doe, I don't need anything else, fuck, sign agreements, sign myself
I have my migos crossing the border, a grocery bag full of arm and a baking soda
At my moment, my friends get that job, they seed your whole block so that you count to 10
Wake up quavo. Wats up take off. Wats up offset. Man dis for projects
Dis for gangsta s, dis for hustlas, the Nostra dawg coast can't touch us
They can't see me, they can't catch me, the feds look at me like an tv
Cd stay on repeat, drag with the sweep of the street, stay anywhere
Kilo go by 33
A lot of time has passed
I'm DJ Durel and I'd like to welcome you to Rich Nigga Timeline
Rich Young Nigga Riding The City With The Mac
Take a helicopter and a chicken, now watch the leak (ba-bow)
Whip it and break it, do it, take it
Nigga confuse me, think I'm selling that dwarf (nah, really)
What the hell does a nigger really want to talk about? (Shit)
You're a bitch, we have nothing to talk about
Shivering like a stripper, put that mac chicken in her mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, told me to weigh it and break it
Migo Jerz, whipping that lambo, now watch it drift
I'm a handsome boy, so you know I have to stay low (hot)
Quavo told me, catch on the block and hit them like OJ Mayo
You niggas are rookies but young Takeoff, I'm a vet (vet)
'Set told me catching and rubbing gon' wet that pussy
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray Vet
I'm a young black man with rich black ambitions
At the Migo show, a black man signing boobs
And you're ashamed to admit it, I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster nigga, seems suspicious
Walk to him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all I wanted was a photo
Now I'm a backwoods nigga guy
A nigga, he ran, he tried to steal, I shot him
Whites still treat me like I'm a victim.
Now people shout "Actavis libre"
Check my mug of muddy troubles, I have packages in the attic
Catch me riding with packages in my rental
Cheat, dab cheat when i'm on revenue
Diamond brick comes with a note, nigga, Blues Clues
24 karat my chain, Mr. T, pity the fool
Master P, unlimited money, side jumping like a bungee jumping
Kevin Hart, your money is too short, you are too funny
Call me Takeoff Hugh Hefner, I have Playboy bunnies
Fuck it, I beat him, she sucks me until a nigger takes revenge
Cross the country, cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we crossed the country
She doesn't understand English but she loves me
Cross the country, cross the country
When you're on the street, you know you must make a name for yourself
I stole a Mustang, I fall, I have no brain
The police had a nigga, 'cause they know I'm in a gang
On my first lick, I only had a little change
Thinking like Obama, something has to change
When I got out of jail, I did the same
I spent that money, money, coming back like a boomerang
They say I'm ignorant, $ 50,000 in a chain
You know it doesn't come from Johnny Dang
Fake clock busta can't break me, there's no lie
Won't catch me with fake jewelry, I'm too proud
They killed my nigga Pistol P by three and five
I pay the ticket, when are you going to die?
When I'm in the kitchen, I cook crack cakes
I have chickens in the trunk, you think I work at Popeyes
The streets are the jungle, my nigga, you better survive
Marry the money nigga, that my girlfriend
My diamonds will shine, they could hit you in the eye
You're selling for ounces, my nigga, you're just passing
Put the birds in my hands, know when it will fly
Glah! Glah! Glah! In the bushes like a spy
Talking crazy to the Migos, boy, you know we keep the fire
I got that helicopter, flip a black man like dominoes
Young rich black man never made the honor roll
Hit his butt with the .44, make him bend
Chattahoochee River where that body of nigga floats
She on a mission, trying to fuck me, you better get your ho
Yellow diamonds on my face like a moon cake
Two Glocks on my hip as Tomb Raider
Arnold Schwarzenegger becomes Terminator
You may never have been there, catch me crossing the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She doesn't understand English but she loves me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a visa because I am in and out of the country
Cross the country, my plug it in Wyoming
And the only time I stop you, if a nigga owes me
And the whole word knows that a young black rap
But a better nigga pussy won't provoke me
He entered the game with the formula, he sold it
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run towards you
All you can eat in my trap like it's Shoney
Rich Nigga timeline: that's my fucking testimony
Out in the desert, I have bricks in the donkey
Rich black man with a pot of gold like a leprechaun
And I'm thinking of moving to Babylon
My niggas collecting extortion funds
We build an empire like Megatron
I already told you, I want the M & Ms, fuck the fame
There's no shame in the game, I'm a bull with all nine
Walking through the crowd, I don't have to stick the chain
Oh no i ended up rolling down the block and i don't see it
I paid J $ 200 just to hit me when I saw it
He had some jewelry, worth $ 100, so I took it off.
He took the first PC in the whole country, it got too hot for a moment
They say he got a job, now I have it
On the player platform at Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas like I'm Roman
All kinds of euros and yen.
I told the Lord to forgive me for my sins
Cross the country, cross the country
You may never have been there, catch me crossing the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we crossed the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She doesn't understand English but she loves me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a visa because I am in and out of the country
These bitches see a young black man
Because I'm walking with these hundreds
And I stop at that Lambo
So fast you can't even see me coming
I have chickens in the field
I have an AK finna start playing drums
You were talking shit behind my back
But now here, a nigga you're not saying anything
Rich young black man lives forever, my smart A1 cheat game
You say I'm broke, how dare you?
I will never go bankrupt never ever
Then feed the sharks for dinner
Quavo too hot like a kettle
Bye bye bye
You're not talking goodbye nigga cash

West coast, nigga
Troubled world, troubled boy
Hard times destroyed my smile
Without change of heart, without change of opinion.
You can take what is yours but you will leave what is mine
I'd rather die than go home
I'd rather die than go home
And I won't leave without my 40 acres
Unpolished, no apology
This cocaine cowboy took him to the limit
You thought Tony in that cell would have made us shy
We find your old cell, bitch, we dig through the digits
Anything Spanish made me speak Spanglish
The dream is not to die, just some real niggas
We were born to mothers who could not deal with us.
Left behind by parents who wouldn't build with us
I had both of mine at home, let's face it, niggas
My best half chose the best path, applaud it
I heard the Devil's new playground is boredom
The top of California falls like fall
And they say I'm about to win
I claim victory when Malice is about to sin
Old habits die hard, that rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It's heaven for a scammer, no cemeteries
Much more burns us, ashes to ashes
Now celebrate motherfuckers raise your glasses
Push...
Troubled world, troubled boy
Hard times destroyed my smile
Without change of heart, without change of opinion.
I'd rather die than go home
I'd rather die than go home
And I won't leave without my 40 acres
Unpolished, no apology
Could have broken a heart or two but gave a sincere effort
My carefree attitude is always 'F it'
Thirty-five years of marriage and my mom left him
The best question is, did you enjoy dancing with him>
(Yughh!) I'll probably never get you out of the chair, bitch
All that shit I bought you you wear out
Rich, and I'm the only one that matters to me
Hate me or love me, only he can judge me
Unpolished, no apology
Big Willie with the hit, niggas, I'm a legend
School of hard hit, I attended
Sell hard rock, fuck who I offended
He was a goner punished for karma
911 came with ass shots
A crack addict was the pet
The owner of the key to that padlock
I'm Jordan vs. Cavs for the last shot
I need everything of mine, repairs
We grow poppy seeds on my 40 acres
Push!
Hard times destroyed my smile
Without change of heart, without change of opinion.
And I won't leave without my 40 acres
I let you enter my diary to admire me
The composition of this man, I let you see how much taller I am
The drug dealer dichotomy
I am drawing from both sides, I am Siamese
The push and pull opens the door, entrance
Destroy me and see what's inside this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada is a saga
A chapter of black magic, I am Harold Potter
Relationships with their parents will not allow us to flourish
And flower, I swear the nights in Las Vegas were fucking amazing
But goodbye, I blew my own dice before I threw them
Fight with work, we were like the four horsemen.
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm fucking precious
WOOOOOO !!
As the gull-wing gates rise
Karate Kid, Crane Kick: Not Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coca brush they paint me with
Sunken leather seats softer than an angel's kiss
But they're devil red, double tires
I publish and I park, that gives me double head
Tightrope walking tries to keep head level
The bright blind lights watch what the devil did
She left the door open, did she care if I'm famous
I write this only in Las Vegas
He flew street money party nights with the list
I write this only in Las Vegas
I write this only in Las Vegas
I'm the only one left and the memories fade
I write this only in Las Vegas
They will do everything in their power.
It stomps near the stove when you're going up like flour
Drop your cake when you threaten its tower
It's 911 that you're on your 25th hour
Goodbye I'm coming out of the stands
The game cannot grow simply by following the leaders
You have to be better than the previous ones, yes
Update them, outshine them
Change the shape of the whole body and just update them, pagans
It was Reagan I ran contraband
Money caused land wars across the promised land
The first time that being rich could be an ordinary man
The Guy Fishers had the plans and diagrams.
We just take what we need and build it
Lord forgive me for the blood I spilled on her
She left the door open, did she care if I'm famous
I write this only in Las Vegas
Remember the nights my team screwed it up at the tables
I write this only in Las Vegas
Fear of God niggas, made me feel like Pac

It's good. Music
You are sweet to me, diabetes; peace treaties
Breakfast of champions, they need Wheaties
Carrying the torch, the four Olympic rings
I hear them whisper like a hummingbird sings
Of all the trust issues that hundreds of birds bring
It is a common theme: victim or vice-lord
Disciple or black stone, what you look for in Christ
We in the last days, fire or ice storm
I use it on my chain as a symbol of a crime lord
Jealousy is a sin, Cain killed Abel
Backstabber, Caesar had Brutus
You did your best to be here at night.
Man, it feels good, everything is fine
The energy is strong enough to illuminate the city lights.
All my team wins, I have no vision to stop smoking
I'd rather say yes than let the destroyers say no
Let them talk about it, well, I'm already living
Now I'm with this money, lounging like it's a beach chair
Servants' round killers, we're happy to be here
Look at them, take them, let your soul pay your debts
That's a tactic they use, fuck them high and then suck them dry
Before you know it, your Q7 is buzzing by
The queen's pin redeems the king's pin
Yuugh! This is the life that we made
Shooting in the dark like a sweet serenade
Come on, let's drink to champagne, this is for life.
Man, it feels good, everything is fine
The energy is strong enough to illuminate the city lights.
All my team wins, I have no vision to stop smoking
I'd rather say yes than let the destroyers say no
Let them talk about it, well, I'm already living

No niggas you bleed with
Court cases ran base and highway aces
Lick shots or left bodies without a trace
Yuugh! This is the life that we made
Come on, let's drink to champagne, this is for life.
Man, it feels good, everything is fine
The energy is strong enough to illuminate the city lights.
All my team wins, I have no vision to stop smoking
I'd rather say yes than let the destroyers say no
Let them talk about it, well, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it
See my ouija board never lie to me
The best rapper who lives, I know who is alive for me.
Raah, I make these motherfuckers hide from me
The life of Sergio Tacchini that we defend
You just pose photos for them so you can upload
Yuugh! This is the life that we made
Shooting in the dark like a sweet serenade, nigga
Come on, let's drink to champagne, this is for life.
You did your best to be here at night.
Man, it feels good, everything is fine
The energy is strong enough to illuminate the city lights.
I'd rather say yes than let the destroyers say no
Let them talk about it, well, I'm already living
I risk my life to try every day to go and get it, get it, get it
Black ambition, no
Lack of vision, lead to
Bad decisions then
Light it up, you little hitter
Change your number
Light it up, you little hitter
Switch it on
But the antidote
It might not be exactly what you smoke
It may be a letter from a long time ago
From someone you know
Who has been there before?
There you go
On my third hit, I also sinned
The best was coca, that I have lived
Caught with a baby, cry a million tears
I had the most real black bitch
I've seen the truest niggas snitch
Get a job, seen the niggas change more real
Whispering, "The drug boy is dead"
Says the credit card, mothafuckas
Black ambition, no
Blacks in prison, no
Lack of vision, lead to
Bad decisions then
Light it up, you little hitter
Change your number
Light it up, you little hitter
Switch it on
But the antidote
It might not be exactly what you smoke
From someone you know
Who has been there before?
There you go
He wishes death upon his soul until they burn in a fire
I'm the craziest mothafucka breathing, fucks your rhyme or your reason
Fucking on your troubles, it's the season to kill a nigga
I made my way, way, I found my way, way
Bar-plow-da, I made mine, ho
YUGHHH, have you never had black local shit?
Woo, how the hell do I owe you local niggas?
I'm a global nigga, buyer from the Champs Elysées
I looked at Eric B and the drug dealer, chain rockers
Where were you when I was bleeding?
Disappointed and fighting my demons
And I feel…
And I feel like they want to take my life
Be careful what you say, be careful what you do
Tell them what they want to hear, but stay away from the truth.
And I feel like they want to take my life
It's not enough that I fight in my career
Less appreciated when I was part of a pair
I pushed an envelope full of truth as if challenged
The representation and depth were proof that it was there.
There is no doubt in my origins.
Photo album full of Polaroids still pointing
Seven different SIM cards, bringing all that mortar
Brick by black brick, all it adds is water in
I just wanna float through the clouds Hermes seams on my towels
Not too flashy shit, just the diamonds on the dials
Woo, and I'm still buying mo 'weapons
Mo 'money, mo' nigga murder, pick one
Be careful what you say, be careful what you do
Tell them what they want to hear, but stay away from the truth.
And I feel like they want to take my life
Benzes drug dealer with gold diggers on them
In elevator condos, in everything I love
This is not a wave or phase, because all that shit fades away
This lifestyle is forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made them wait
What the fuck do you expect
When a black man has a cape and he is cool?
The oven is full of cakes that she bakes, still spreading pasta
Love only accentuates hate
This is for my bodybuilders' clients moving weight
Just add water, stir it like a smoothie
Play among the stars as the roof of the Wraith
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-black says he makes
This is my purple ribbon, save for the rainy days
And baby mama wishes along with the side bitches
They try to coexist, they end up wanting to die, bitches
No jewelry, but you're richer than everyone
You laugh a little louder, the DJ says your name a little prouder
And we don't need a balloon to show you that the world is ours
We can bet a hundred thousand with my secure reservation
My numbers look like a bank code
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-black says he makes
With Ye back choppin ', cars and women come with options
Caviar facials remove toxins
Who grew up with legends of external Yonkers?
I'm incentivized by two points two
If you don't have energy like the bunny for drug money
Or being paralyzed by seeing a drug mummy
This is not really for you, this is for Goya Montoya
Whoever said he couldn't stop, then offered me all the lawyers
The only kingpin that isn't sinking
I could buy your bitch some new hips and rip her rib off
The message in this music, all my niggas had to live
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex black says he makes, yeah!
Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Cut off the top of the coupes
The four hundred 'eighty eight
Spider joint
And you know we have to cut off the heads of these snakes, right?
Watch the body fall
Try drugs aside, ghost writing aside
Let's talk honestly about your pride
Although you are multiple, I see that your soul does not seem alive
The M count is different when the baby divides the cake, wait
Let's examine why
I'll start it in the front of the house, "I'm On One"
Dennis Graham stay out of the 'gram, bitch, I'm on one
Your father left at five, an incredible thing for dad
Marriage is something Sandi never had, Drake
How are you a winner but she keeps coming last?
Monkey monkey Dennis, you parade it
A black Steve Harvey suit did it
Confused, I always felt you weren't black enough
Fear of growing up because your parano would not get enough sleep
Since you named my fiancée
Let them know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better than your mother baby
Cleaned it for IG, but the stench is in it
A baby is involved, it's deeper than rap
We talk about character, let me continue with the facts
You're hiding a boy, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothafucka playing border patrol, ooh
And he deserves more than a press career from Adidas; This is real
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world!
I'm selfish, I want all the curses
If we all go to hell, it will be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
OVO 40, hunched like him 80: tic, tic, tic
How much time do you have? That man is sick, sick, sick
Surgical summer with him: short, short, short
And you really don't want it with him
Let's take this slow
We are just going to peel it layer by layer
Album of the damn year
And you're talking about being upset
Hahaha
Show me that
Razor
The devil is a lie
You haven't broken bread until you taste devil's pie
They say her laughter sounds like an angel when she cries
What better camouflage when the halo is your costume
Wings do not fly; your traitor is your neighbor
Bathrobe on, but the sword is underneath
And he wants to see your blood as it spills on the street
It is the mark of the beast
The meek will inherit the earth; the weak will inherit the dirt
Each of you should have perished at birth, stillbirth or abortion
Every street tax must come with an audit
Or your life, or your loved ones, a razor or a pistol
From the town where the thugs come from
The same corner where you are taking all your drugs
He is a hero, but he does not recognize him, I am the one.
Now make a move, these guns whistle, sizzle guys
Who has big mouths, without power
We are better than the rest of them, I guess it's estrogen
And all the money we have, we move like Mexicans.
Yes, the coca is fresh, directly from Bermuda
Or relax on a beach in Boca Chica
Passage of bread balances to the island from
1984 the hit was just over
Then we would come with rockin 'Nike boots and war rifles
The real invention of a black that came from a henchman
Who exploded, now vomits the Wu, that's my redemption
Drug dealer, been that nigger half my life
Drug dealer, been that nigger half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen them
Imagine being the first name with the kingpin
You wouldn't believe some of the things these people do for this article
Make a move, do the papers, lose, lose the situation
Sweat or blood, you can choose what to bathe in
Chemists cook, runners; footwork
The custies took work, the soldiers put work in
In any of the motherfuckers who screwed up the good job
The bosses tell them: 'Good job', this is how the bell works
North face bubble with eight packs underneath
Golden front upper lip smile as I hugged it
I lied, it wasn't Lucifer's neighbor, the one I'm fucking with
My moms threw that snow up her nose, but I'd push her
Champ hoodie, mongoose with pegs
Clap your hands, duck moms duke on your legs
That's meat nigga, you're not street niggas
Fucking everything, heavy neck swing
In that Nissan, Honda, Chevy selling things
Whatever fetti brings, I constantly fed my entire team
Drug dealer, been that nigger half my life
You niggas talking, but you ain't never seen them
Imagine being the first name with the kingpin
In this art of war, the stroke of my pen is Picasso
Niggas get the picture, I don't have to paint the nostrils
You know my origins ended when
Fat Black Bitches Singing About Organs
Die for a dollar, pride you don't swallow
Yuugh! That's the price you have to pay
Anything goes in love and war, she disguises herself
Court! Jack-O-Lantern Push
Trick or treat, fuck your shit, I earned it from the books
Now listen to me ventilate
When you look sitting, it's like the tires are worn
Shots from everywhere, but they never make a dent
Knight in shining armor
Confuse me with the villain because my revenge is your karma
Yes, fear is knowing that you are a goner
This music for my soul, because it is death before dishonor
Gone
Check! I have the tongue of a pimp, raised by a dirty preacher
That used the church money to copy a new Beamer.
I have the heart of a child raised by a prostitute
That bought his mom the gums when a John appeared
It is the methadone microphone, the best stone engraving
You are not going to have a pussy as if your graduation date had a chaperone
Busted pills have a black brain like a maze
I called ho on purpose but I had the brain by accident
Nigga, I'm your majesty, show up with a bag of weed
My manuscript leaves a man stripped of all his dreams
The insomniac with nightmares in sixteens
I'm a wet dream, dry sense of humor
Traveling in class as a high school rumor
No one cares if you embarrass us in style
Because when it comes to raps, you've let us down
So tell them why you're crazy son
I gotta get it off you, let them know how you feel son
You have to say what you say
It doesn't matter, they'll say a nigga hates anyway
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Look at my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm about to take the Porsche
You leave me no choice, take them to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
It started with 28 grams and a hammer.
They forgot the third one, I'm up, antenna
Winter time, bags in the mall, Santa mal
Fifth Square, Lennox Square Mall, Atlanta
Twinkle Toe, Louboutins, hoes love glamor
Black and white diamonds on the chain, that's panda
Great Music Calendar, Def Jam Planner
Now all the fans and the feds have cameras
White on the blow like dandruff
Turn the white girls over, that's Vanna
Sell him 10, face another 10, that's standard
He asked to receive 20 more. That's random
Look at the signs, cut the black, that's cancer
Kill him and then he kisses his mom's cheek.
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Look at my ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I'm about to take the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take them to
I need you to touch it, touch it, touch it
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit, do something, do something
Can you touch it, touch it, touch it?
Or just kiss it, kiss it, shit, do something, do something
Please pretty please
Or maybe you could touch it, see where it leads
Go away, just hit him like you're Billy Jean
That coconut Ciroc, look, that's all we really need
I hope you can polish like Pledge what I need
I move too fast, because just when I believe
You came to turn it off like Drake and the dream
How to kiss him like he's standing under miseltoe
Although my love game made you feel so official
I let you referee, just let your whistle blow
I'm never out of bounds, I'm on higher ground
The Commes Des Garcons, the Christian Louboutin
J brand jeans look like you drew them
Once you have the right frame of mind, maybe you should give it a try
Oh, I'm past in my past
I ran like the flash and saved the best for last
See we can take it easy, or we can take it there
I'm thinking about lap dance and you should take a chair
You see this from one side to the other, for me it is a bit strange
Let your hair down, I ain't got you glued like a square
Just let go while you drive in that ruthless
And buck hair fluttering in the wind
You are as champion as you take it on the chin
What do you want to fuck? Do you want something?
I swear on my fucking mother, if you touch her again, you're dead
Do not shoot
All I see is
Black roses, drug dealer poses
Shoveling that demon's angel, noses
Never let prison turn my shine to Moses
Backseat driver, racial slurs at the driver
Kilian loafers
The photo shoot is priceless, frame my desired posters
War brings casualties
Bitch have my son before you face that tragedy
I ordered blows, she orders Mahi
R-I-P Vivian [?]
Ask for [?]
I want to talk to all of you addicts
That got you a great Jones
And you've already tried all the methadone
And you just can't leave that heroine alone
I wonder, have you tried?
Dope just made landfall, I am so grateful
So low numbers, bitch, be thankful
They say don't let money change you
This is how we know that money is not you
Bitch, I've been, bitches have been bad
We buy big ships, bitch, I'm Sinbad
All my fools, we like relatives
BMore burnt spoon, DC glass tube
VA sent bullets over that life trap
I hit classics, I've been brilliant
Now we mix, we are chameleons, ahh!
I've never been locked in a world of misery
I need you baby to set me free
Ooh, honey, I'm about to go crazy
I can not
Who else has the luxury of leaving when they want?
Why can't anybody else fuck me? What boast
Nigga, wrist by wrist, let's have a shine
Fuck it, brick by brick, let's make an explosion
If we go for connections made
I can still climb stairs when the complexion fades (Yugh)
White on white, that's the Testa
Black on black, that's the Tesla
Do you see these diamonds on this watch face?
They don't miss you until you left with the wind
And they got tired of dancing like a Ying Yang twin
You can't have Yin without Yang, my friend
Real niggas bring balance to the game I'm in (Yugh!)
I can't escape the scale if I tried, interstate traffic is alive
I need you baby to set me free
Come back baby, try me one more time
Ooh, honey, I'm about to go crazy
I can not
Still fresh off the ship, niggas
Don't make me super soaked niggas
Your life ends up being a date, nigga
It really is just that mom is falling in love with the reverend
I play musical chairs with these squares
Rich style before it was Ric Flair
Cocaine janitor, the longest trapper of the year
I stood the test of time as Dapper Dan
Season my sauce like Zatarain's
Is he still in the caravan? (No)
Richard Mille in a leather band (Whoo)
Behind the wheel like an ambulance (Go)
On my way to Maryland (Gone)
I've never been locked in a world of misery
Come back baby, try me one more time
Ooh, honey, I'm about to go crazy
I can not
Come back baby, try me one more time
It's the blackout, 'Rari stuck her back out
Showing my black ass, engine in the glass house
It started at the crack house, Obama was the way back
Kill bin Laden, four others in the black house
I still trick with bitches, with money or with ass pounding
GOOD I had room for one more, I took last place
Any other level, then you add fame
He's a real devil, a legitimate drug dealer.
That's a bevel, the Audemar carbon
That's a completely different metal, but I still keep it in the ghetto
Behind the scenes, pull ropes like Gepetto
The gun blows steam, whistles like a kettle
Running like the rebels, UNLV
Sports shoe on a pedal, I let you niggas calm down (yeah!)
Problems in my head
So many problems on my mind
Problems in my head
I have problems on my mind
So many problems on my mind
Pharrell said "take them" so I have them
I bumped into Bristol Palin and then accidentally shot them
Then it bounced and killed the game, I'm a problem
Because I want to fuck the world but I'm not a fan of using condoms
Forgive my French, I'm getting hard like my cock
When I picture my tip on the bark of bitch's lips
Mr. Lipschitz has been stumbling
Since I mentioned the dinosaur cock Reptar triceratops
I feel in my guts kill these idiots
It is a duty, like the arm of my wells
You niggas come shorter than a Bushwick Billy costume
Um, well, not really, it's getting a little cold
Soaked, getting nervous with him in Bel-Air's richest
With a bag of pills, a couple of berries and a cookie
I have problems on my mind
Problems in my head
So many problems on my mind
I'm a fucking walking paradox
And a fucking rapper in my favorite socks
Ironed pair of stevedores, two Glocks cocked yelling, "West side!"
With the speakers popping a pair of Pacs
Yonkers 10 milli, you're dumb
Thinking this preme wasn't free, Willy
The feeling is neutral, the gang is youthful
And fucking stronger than Chad Hugo's pupils, it's Wolf Gang and the
With the Re-Up it's a hellish buzz
Rick James said cocaine is a hellish drug
Who else could put hipsters with criminals and thugs?
And to paint a perfect image of what you sell?
This is for the critics, who doubted the chemistry.
Two different worlds, the same symmetry.
And this black art, watch the magic when you're on top
From your game, you make enemies, you will never finish me
Problems in my head
I have problems on my mind
Problems in my head
So many problems on my mind
Oh no
Me? I get every clink of blood clot
Ah, ah, take care of me, ah, bring money, come, give me
Yuh you don't see my titty dem how stiff are they? Ah he buy dem gimmie
Can't you see my big house with car and land? Ah he buy it gimmie
So tell me, I wish you didn't make a sketch of bald people?
Nuttin
These women are not shit but hoes with tricks
Baby you're different
When you're not around, something seems to be missing
Never tell a lie
You know you heard what they say
True love is hard to find
I could trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
I could only trust you with my drugs
I could trust you with my money
I could trust you with my drugs
I could trust you with my money, girl
Who would have thought that he would have fucked you?
Years later, we at the villa suites
Remembering my episodes
With them extra hoes, but you didn't cheat
Cold nights when you couldn't sleep
Celine bags were the gift given
C-Class helped you see the past
Whoo! I'm good money
It's alright that she's the best bitch
But she just wants to know the end result
Phillip Lim, Derek Lam
Every player should know that she is sponsored
Whoo! You earned that
We turn, we turn
We've gone too far to go back
When you're not around, something seems to be missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell a lie
You know you heard what they say
I could trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
I could trust you with my money
Girl I'll trust you with my drugs
I could trust you with my money
I could trust you with my drugs
I could trust you with my money, girl
Locked phones, past time
Spend time, presidential
Rolexes, both sexes.
Blue bezel that we both flex
Big Diamonds, We Bowflexing
Throw dope, land
Both sports, I'm Bo Jackson
Your bitch up front, that's you
I break it, then I break it
Of everything they talk about
Bitches on the prowl: your page is blocked
And they still know when you buy
You still know i'm all inside
I'm going to hate the fact that I'm spoiling
Whoo! But you earned that
Where the hell did you learn that?
We turn, we turn
We've gone too far to go back
These women are not shit but hoes with tricks
Baby you're different
When you're not around, something seems to be missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell a lie
You know you heard what they say
True love is hard to find
I could trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
I could only trust you with my drugs
I could trust you with my money
I could trust you with my drugs
I could trust you with my money, girl
Please don't matter
I just need some time
I just have to make sure you know all of mine
Standing there looking, with your bow-legged pose
See yourself as more than just a ho you could crush
Polo in my pants standing at attention
When you get out of the shower and your butt moves
Take a look at the ceiling
Now your glass is empty
Thinking back, really
I already grabbed a fox
That's supposed to fit after the video
The batteries will really explode
You stay the same, no matter up or down
The money comes and help us spend it
But I will fuck my niggas in the same minute
I was depressed and I had to go to prison
A little high role play, acki
And again I say that I like these hoes
Lyrically I am untouchable, unwavering
Blunt by 600, blunt by 600
Blunt by 600, blunt by 600
To separate me from you kings of YouTube
I'm more U2, I'm like Bono with the edge
In Mexico, he fucks Donald and his promise
Legend has it, the doll is magic
Left is Patek, Philippe is replaced by Matsuhisa.
Ignore most requests for the role
Unless it is played on the beach of Ibiza
While she fucks Nesha and she sucks shisha
Can't you see my Total? Pam, Kima, Keisha
I'm targeting tycoons, why are all you niggas targeting the locals?
And the rap niggas broke like them, they just hope
The last to discover that Baby owns the cars
Jaws' final trilogy
It feels like I'm still white
Matching Missoni looks African to me
They try to fix this traffic like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spill
Yuugh! It's a different calisthenics when I do the Lennox
Half a million in parallel and nothing for rent
Yes, using Dri-Fit on my shit
Mounts a little better in the cabin
Untouchable, unshakable
Mu told me to change my style
Just got home from the feds as a null trial
It tells me I lose all that club money, I don't bounce
Adidas gave me a million and that doesn't bounce
The President of G.O.O.D. The music has been announced
My breakdown game bought me fame of "8 miles"
Selling to him and Eminem
White to the Blacks I'm a villain in
The Rolls Royce, playing peek-a-boo with the emblem
Let's talk about it gentlemen
My barcode is "Narcos" from Netflix
Part of the side of my side like I'm Pablo
I don't speak, I sell blow
Lone Wolf, Not Silly, Head Honcho
Yuugh, let's take the scenic route
They open the wash bay, I raise it like K2
Of every Spanish name I made I found
No matter the weight, I ran it
I'm walking on water, I took off my sandals
Tell A&E to turn off the cameras, push
Untouchable, unshakable
Blunt by 600, blunt by 600
Untouchable, unshakable
Blunt by 600, blunt by 600
(PIXIE LOTT feat. Pusha T)
Let's go
Yes, we get attention as an exorcist
These red bottoms on our feet look devilish
We take it to the next level, effortlessly
I'm tired of you kicking the ground, I just want the dust to settle
I'll find what I deserve, if you can't do better
I can't say you'll take your time, before the sweet turns sour
I don't know what you think I'm looking for
Don't think I can take it anymore
I don't know what you think I'm looking for
Why are you taking me, why are you taking me?
Then i am whatever
Bye, see you later
Why are you taking me, why are you taking me?
Oh why do you take me?
Let go because I'm cutting the rope, I guess you went up to the wrong tower
I don't know what you think I'm looking for
Don't think I can take it anymore
I don't know what you think I'm looking for
Then i am whatever
Bye, see you later
Why are you taking me, why are you taking me?
Two children in a bucket, f * ck
The way you handle this
Yes i am disgusted
I've never been arrested, treat me like a suspect
Why am I the only one you can't trust?
Try more, discuss it, why bother?
I made you, I will make another and she will go further
And you can bet a million
South of France on a yacht with us relaxing
I don't know what you think I'm looking for
Don't think I can take it anymore
Why are you taking me, why are you taking me?
Then i am whatever
Go through the front door
Why are you taking me, why are you taking me?
“It is very difficult for me to sit here in this study, look at a boy here, shout my name! When last year I spent more money, on spilled liquor, in bars from one side of this world to the other, than you earned! You're talking to Rolex, wearing a diamond ring, stealing kisses, wow! Facing wheels, riding limousines, flying in an airplane, the son of a gun, and I have a hard time holding these alligators!
Bow your heads as the Lord mentions
Prayer service in the kitchen.
I wish they would never find Jimmy Henchmen
I am what dreams are made of
Cocaine Ronald gave us
So Nancy tried to save us
By then we had Motorola pagers
Now we press starter motors
Yacht owners, you little guys, that's Pop Warner
Menage a trois in the bathhouse
Blowing money on them, bitches never have a bad mouth
Crystal slipper, bad whores, I just got paid
You open doors, I open jaws and I pass out
Luxury is just my lifestyle.
I'm Scott free with a million dollar bright smile
You niggas get money, I never heard of it
I am what dreams are made of
Sell me that pussy, I'd rather buy it baby
Look at your bag, you need help, you can't deny it baby
I am what dreams are made of
Yes, Louboutins under sweatshirts
One hundred just landed for responding to a text message
Niggas talk money but I'm still not impressed
When these thousand dollar sneakers made me feel naked
Hip hop bores me, scam artists applaud me
Too much school boy, not enough rude boy
And it's not even half my safe, hidden like the Jewish boy
Bentley with the rag yarmulke
It says kilometers all on my speedometer
Cocaine under my tongue as a thermometer
I have a fever, I never took a breath
I need an outlet like Nas needed an ether
Like Mike Vick chased by PETA
More horse hair, more zebras
More pythons, more lizards
You niggas get money, I never heard of it
I am what dreams are made of
Sell me that pussy, I'd rather buy it baby
Look at your bag, you need help, you can't deny it baby
I am what dreams are made of
Niggas talking shit, Push, how do you respond?
The feds take pictures like it's GQ (GQ)
This Avianne clavicle is transparent
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?" (we make)
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge Akinyele
Middle fingers of the Ghost, shouting "Makaveli" (come with me)
Two sides for each coin, so we're bail ready (bail ready)
How do you answer
I let the money and the fools speak
I let the jewels and shades speak
Chanel is in your bitch
The coupe is 320, the roof is unpredictable
See I did it my way, the proof is in the bricks
Eghck! Smell it through Tupperware (Tupperware)
Two can get you four as a double challenge (woo!)
I'm the king of the ovenware
You can assemble the whole puzzle here
Niggas talking shit, Ye, how do you respond?
Poo, shovel!
Howl! Whoopty-whoop!
Am I too complex for ComplexCon?
Everything you say causes a new debate
"You see, he was out of touch, he can't relate
Your hallway too long, bitch too bad
I'm thinking, "What would 2Pac do?"
You will be thinking about what New Kids on the Block do
If you don't drive while you're in Black, will they stop you?
Will MAGA hats allow me to glide like a drive-thru?
That phone call from Ricky is still confusing
When heaven got an angel named Avery
You have to see who you call crazy
Yeezy, the new billion dollar baby
It won't feel good until I feel like Phil Knight
Go for six rings like what Phil said to Mike
No more hiding the scars, I show them as Seal, right?
How do you answer

Ricky went unattended
He sent Donda to heaven with Avery
I'm thinking, "What would 2Pac do?"
You may be thinking "What are the New Kids on the Block doing?"
Drizzy wearing Yeezys on the bass though

It doesn't feel good until I feel like Phil Knight

Pour on you, hallelujah, pour on you, hallelujah
Even if they are leftovers, I still have to eat, right?
I have gas in my peace pipe, Pink Sprite
She popping her tight jeans

Coming to that, without hesitation
To fuck with me you need a reservation
Good musical legislation, delegatin '
And I mean that shit like exclamation, exclamation, exclamation

You see they gave us crack, then they started waging a war
Uh, all these lies, they tell me constantly
Before Obama, we had Eric B. (Woo)
Or Tony Lewis in D.C.
The 80's Kingpins have to free them
All these faces don't believe in
When love goes, you hold on to anything
Some do wrong, just to feel something
But when the void is full, you face anything
When love is real you can do anything
(You can do everything)
Uh, I do it for my big Benz drivers.
For my street corner survivors (survivors)
For my niggas who miss The Wire (Woo)
And throwback moms, that won't go away
Remembering the days
When the trips went to Cancun and sprayed the bottles
You were getting into cars, we were breaking bad
When everyone was fighting dogs, we competed with Jags
There is no future, there is no past, we will not worry about the accident, uh
Now they are jail poses and club photos
Airbrush funds and prison visits
This is the drug boy song for the missing drug boys
Let them know it's still snowing
When love withdraws you hold on to anything
(You hold on to anything)
Some do wrong, they have to do anything
But when the void is full, you face anything
When love is real (When love is real)
You can do anything (you can do anything)
I'm talking to the soul of my black native brothers
Who doesn't have a silver spoon or bankroll?
Who was not taught the golden rule, but did they?
Free apple lunches and juices, huh
Food stamps, embarrassed to use them
Have you ever lived with the user?
I shared a bed with abusers, that's the worst way to lose them
New plan, but it's a new day.
Blacks passed their due date
Freeing captives in a new way
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
It's a new day, niggas pass their due date
Freeing captives in a new way
Said it's not over, it's not over
Yeah it just started it just started
When love is strong you can do anything
Things go wrong, but you will resist anything
Because when the void is full, you can do anything
I went ahead and asked God for forgiveness
So now I'm just asking you to listen
I'm living in a world where my truth may be my lynching
The last words "fuck off" feel the tension of the ropes
I will never compromise, until the powder dries
Best friends drown in quick sand and help you get up cowards
Dental floss in his honor, there is legacy in bottles
We were all fucking Shawna, you and E were fucking with her
He was jealous when they both said his mouth was like a piranha
Yes, spend money like we print money
Buck fifty in the car, that's little money from Dent
Air conditioning is bankrupt forever, that's ventilation money
Cocaine soared while playing my rent money
Daily fight, get money, get the crown for
Let's say you tell me, you told them friends about me
All this coke around me like it's floating around me
Cook it, cook it, you know I cook it
Cook it every time you come
I just bought the house, I put the pent
Two hundred thousand K spent for rent
Cook it, cook it, you know I cook it
Made me look at the crown from a bird's eye view
Now i'm on top of the words i drew
Rap shit will drive you crazy, that led to Shyne Jew
Mazel tov, now I'm hotter than a molotov
Tell Lyor I need a million for my monologues
A small price for my cocaine catalog.
Cut the scalp like a hatchet
Travelodge stories, I pray you ignore me
If you can't feel a swindler's joy in his glory
Hiding money on a wall from the first to the third floor
ATL, Glenridge, the true history of the condo
A man of everything I say I am
A little better than the fans, I hope and pray I am
Eliminate the jokers from the deck and just play my hand
Smokers stagnate and go crazy like Peter Pan
All this coke around me like it's floating around me
Cook it, cook it, you know I cook it
I just bought the house, I put the pent
Two hundred thousand K spent for rent
Cook it, cook it, you know I cook it
Yes
Uh huh

In a thousand dollar brokers as you rhyme over your dollars
Is there shame when the mother of a platinum rapper lives in misery?
Mildred is in the Bahamas during the month
I'm probably sitting in my pajamas having lunch
Banana clips for all of you Curious Georges
Old niggas slapping young niggas
Crutches, crosses, coffins
All I see is the death of the masses.
The only asterisk is the change of address.
My infinity pool while Magic's

The house is very cozy, the Porsche is the armadillo.
The silhouette
Pop, pop, pop; the chop, chop, chop
Disposable TEC has Tourettes
It's more than this drug money, I love money

Crutches, crosses, coffins
Crutches, crosses, coffins
Crutches, crosses, coffins

Explosive and cold blooded
Can't trust my handles
Don't splash brothers, cut brothers
Posse Shower as Dudus
Look, I have a thousand cousins
I was focused when they were not
While you guys were out, clubbin '
I ran suicides in the dungeon
There are no simple kicks in my Dame 6
I showed everyone who was not
Money on my mind
That's the marker
(Money on my mind
That's the marker)
That's the marker
(Money on my mind
CHING!
The closer
Shake your head off your shoulders
And the ankle breaks his opponents
Cross you, hocus pocus
This Oakland boy is a soldier
They said there's no one colder
They say the heart is like polar
Because it will hit the game winner
Goodbye, goodbye, it was good to meet you
Adidas (Look at this, look at this, yes)
Lady 6 (I've been playing, yeah)
Push king
Look at this, look at this, yeah
WRITING IS NOT OVER! G.O.O.D. The musical angel logo fades in and out. The opening credits fade as the scenes play, and it reads: "G.O.O.D. MUSIC PRESENTS. A FILM BY: KID ART. PUSHA T. ROTIMI, NATALYA RUDAKOVA. GEORGE KATT, JOE, GIOCO, MIKE TROLL"
Blue lightnings. CUT TO: The lamp blinks in a dark orange room. PUSH lies down on the carpet. He climbs the walls. PUSH and the PRIEST narrate elsewhere

MANNY: (Tsk) Man, put the game on, man! Pulling my mind off all this giraffe shit, man.
On the screen, two lion cubs fight. "DANICA PANTIC PRODUCTION DESIGNER". A lion cub chases and bites a bull. "EDITED BY KID ART".
PUSH mutters numbers to itself. The thunder rumbles.
MANNY: Can't you hear me, muthafucka? Oh, oh ok. So I have to go talk to ... (laughs) this nigger ... So I have to talk to Felicia to make sure you listen to me so that you, you know, since he basically tells you .. .

Shit hate
Broke niggas, that always has something to say
Renegades

Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give me shit what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
Nevermind Nevermind
Nevermind Nevermind
Nevermind Nevermind
It doesn't matter ohh
The gods do not mix with mortals.
The peasants do not sit with the kings
Goliath is not worried about your slingshot
And Cassius doesn't mind your swings
You niggas keep rapping about your dreams, my reality
50 birds waiting on the wings
So when Kanye goes home, it doesn't matter
Since you're talking about me, then let's talk about this money
Let's talk about cars and why mines have a fun way
Let's talk about the fact that you will never take anything from me
Let's talk about the fact that you niggas hate, I'm awake and running
Running through this money and these white women
Spike Lee sees that
She has to have it and I have to give it
And you don't relate because your blacks don't live it, no
I don't care what you say about me
Broke nigga two cents don't matter
Give me shit what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter
Nevermind Nevermind
Nevermind Nevermind
It doesn't matter ohh
Attention seekers be careful, I will grant wishes
We can take this far beyond your mentions
I can get your compliment on YouTube for example
Let everyone see the body
Since everyone claims that I am Illuminati, tell me why you would try me.
Kennedy, John F. or Bobby
He almost caught Reagan, but we were stopped in the lobby
And that was a long day, so how the hell are you going to stop me?
You niggas, only my dirty one is Zero Dark Thirty
Mine is night vision, witch hunt, walk around worthy Pac
I'm a coca boy leaning on you niggas
If the money talks then I must be yelling at you niggas
At the top of the pile, he was two-thirds away
I was distracted busy selling two birds a day, God
Death is just a turnaround
Two men ten steps, then you turn around and spray
Give me shit what you say about me
Broke bitch two cents don't matter

My name is my name!
Re-up gang, G.O.O.D. Music, Def Jam
I love my family
Your nerve
The lowest form of a thief is a cat thief.
On tiptoe 'but all while cloning
The elephant is in the room, the bitch glowing
She walks like it's hers but everyone knows
They said niggas it's God's new flow
Is that the New Testament and the old God know
I'm going to monopolize the flow of the Boardwalk Empire
So don't mention me in the same breath, I'm Genghis
Just breathing, I never wanted to be famous
The truth says that I would rather be strangers
Before it takes me to turn niggas into angels
Local niggas hate but I can't blame them
Put Trey on your hook, I still couldn't save 'em
Best shot with a snowball hitting Satan
Dreams money can buy, three racks I just spent on my Marty McFly
Now I'm back to the future, my career leaves you
When muthafuckers thought I would barely survive
Don't fuck with me
You see it
There are a lot of people out there to be fucked
I am not one
Re-Up Gang
Don't fuck with me
Rappers in their sophomores, acting like they're boss bosses
Fame is such a fun thing for sure
When niggas start to believe they all code
I am the only one to send you, Bonjour
Look at you while I stop in that mirror tint
Comedy sketch, who was for a real pennin '?
The talk does not match the leather
And wolves don't walk with shepherds
These Margiela versa all of you, inhabitants of shopping centers
Out-of-shelf suits that look like pall bearers
Coffins for the orphans of my old bitches
Dad's MIA like a dolphin
Play the Fendi cube like a shark's fin
Great J-ing on you bitches but I'm dark skinned
We go in, seats on the court
Dap Diddy, Will Ferrell on my walk through
At the US Open, there is much more to Queens
Versace blu-blockers, row behind Oracene
Dreams that money can buy
Push ... no shots ... but nothing goes unnoticed
Your nerve, he will sit down and cut your lines
As if I haven't heard from you
I saw it before, that man will kill you
The lowest form of a thief is a cat thief.
The elephant is in the room, the bitch glowing
Like a ghetto girl with the good sewn fabric
I told n * ggas that it's the new flow of God
It's that new testament and that old god knows
And you new niggas can't pass GO
I'm going to monopolize the flow of the waterfront empire
So don't mention me at the same time, I'm Genghis
The truth said he would rather be strangers
Before it takes me to turn niggas into angels
Local niggas hate but I can't blame them
I cleared the way to wealth but I can't pave them
Best shot with a snowball hitting Satan
Dreams money can buy, three racks I just spent on my Marty McFlys
Now I'm back to the future, my career is leaving you-vu
When muthaf * ckers thought I would barely survive
Rappers in their sophomores, acting like they're boss bosses
Fame is so much fun
When n * ggas starts to believe all those encodings
Look at you while I stop in that mirror tint
Chappelle Show, all your Neal Brennans
Sketch comedy, who is to write seriously?
Booty does not match sweaters
And wolves don't walk with shepherds
Out-of-shelf suits that look like pall bearers
Daddy's MIA like a dolphin
Great J-ing on you bitches but I'm dark skinned
We walked in, seats on the court, dap Diddy, Will Ferrell on my walk through
At the US Open, there is much more to Queens
Versace blu-blockers, row behind Oracene
Dreams money can buy, three racks I just spent on my Marty McFlys
Now I'm back to the future, my career is leaving you-vu
When muthaf * ckers thought I would barely survive
Push, no shots, but nothing goes unnoticed
In the midst of negativity
A positive view can be blurred
And the visions that we thought were good.
Seems to let evil happen
While we still possess our human form
We live life seeking greatness from the day we were born
Or poor with dislike, we pray, asking
Sorry for our sinful ways.
With mind, body, spirit and faith, we pray
Amen
Yes (amen) you like that right? (Amen)
I wrote it myself by the way (amen)
Fuck the damn shit (amen)
You have to put it in, bruh, let's put it in (amen)
You like that, don't you? I wrote it myself, by the way
And I don't pretend to be selfish, but I imagine myself charging
And you could get pneumonia, cause I'm colder than an elf on a sled
Uh, Pusha and I get back to that, now everyone helps us pray
Lord forgive my sins and all my friends
Are you trying to save yourself? (Too late!) Time to collect
Got a gun and a stock mask, niggas thought I was trying to get waves
I let all the niggas pray for it, my young niggas take a K from it for it
I sold my soul in the back, just the fucking way I'll pay it
Facing that shit you called, my niggas locked in a cage for
They keep telling me to go hard, number one place you were created for
Yuugh! I did more, in front of the grill, I got a racehorse
California Crayola Red, "Glow In The Dark" as a Ye tour
Damn, niggas stepping on my lane for not knowing what a land mine is?
As soon as a nigga feels a cool breeze lift up the lid like a gang sign
Red or Blue, Crip or Blood, Solitaires, Diamond Studs
Like chandeliers, I am a flood, a black piece of Jesus as if immersed in mud
Gods of fashion, look at mine, rollerball spikes, I'm Pokémon
Paris shit, Louboutin, under bright lights, where do you belong?
Please Lord, yes, it's getting more real every day
Niggas killing, niggas starving, ayy, cause they can't find no yay
See the first thing they roll and their bills they can't pay.
Amen
Amen, how many people do you know hating?
When you shine, I don't know what they're going to say then
Everything I do now stadiums
And I head straight to the ATM
Finna go to JAM, nigga finna come in
Nigga you'll get it when the pigs fly
When Yeezy pretends, the devil's pie
Piece of cake, Kit-Kat
I need a break, child of God
Jesus Christ, club like a broken neck
In Egypt they fight for freedom
The police stop you, without reason, hit them
Please Lord, yes, it's getting more real every day
Niggas killing, niggas starving, ayy, cause they can't find no yay
So some will be trapped, some will be dying, bow our heads and pray
Amen
I have the units packed in that black van like Team A
I've even seen them come in 2 shades like a Saleen (Saleen?)
Break them in the night, that's what I call Hustlin '
Condo on the clock, yeah, that's ignorant
They like, "Young man, you're a fool", yes, I could have bought some real estate
Instead, I bought half a block and tried to sew half the streets.
I'm 75-75, when they were 25
Guess who's taking a trey? Just a common day
With extraordinary payment, extraordinary risk
I can't even explain, I have an extraordinary doll
I speak it because I lived it man, this shit really is nothing to me
I tell you how Sosa said to Tony: "Don't fuck with me"
Please Lord, yes, it's getting more real every day
Niggas killing, niggas starving, ayy, cause they can't find no yay
See the first thing they roll and their bills they can't pay.
So some will be trapped, some will be dying, bow our heads and pray
Amen
Amen, amen, amen, amen.
Amen, amen, amen, amen.
Valentino summers and wave runners
My brick talk is more than obvious, it's sinister
Garages, ghosts, demons, ghosts and goblins.
Blonde Mohawk The Collection I'm Dennis Rodman
Counting money is the only moment of silence.
Because silent money balances all these drugs and violence
After all can i make a call
I can name a brick
America's nightmare is in Flint
Children of a lesser God when your melanin has a tint
And I can't even mention what I sent or what I spent
Because my name on 18 wheels is evidence
I put my boos on those cruise collections
Paid in full as '86, Gs on my body
The new Gucci has fewer monograms, God has it
May he lay the first stone without sin
So I built the entire first four-story glass house
Smash all your misconceptions
Keep them all with missing weapons
The last wrong address already
Your husband was a drug dealer
For 14 years he sold crack
Federico Fellini in the meat
Sergio Tacchini inside his mesh
Find me baby, are you crazy
'89 in London lifts the Benz
Write it down, Google is your bruh friend
14-year-old drug dealer and still counting
It's been hula hoop through loop holes, working around shit
Thanks to the lawyers
I marble the lobby
I tore the floor
Yeah that's for the koi fish
We have been dining on oysters
I walk through the garage is like multiple options
I told them to raise the Royce
I'm getting ghost, I hear noises
I think it's the boys, but I've been banking at Deutsche
We were opening studios and 40 / 40s up
The paper trail is beautiful
Cases we bury
Before the reasonable doubt fell, the jury hung up
Every time I come to your city, bling bling
My tenure took me through Virginia
Ask Teddy Riley about me
Ask the Federalis ‘about me
I tried to build a cell around me
Grabbed my nigga Emory
I tried to get him to talk about me
He said to 12, "Give me 12"
He told them to go to hell for me.
Anonymous drug dealers
You think Uber is the future, our cars have been autonomous
We just call the shots just by moving our thumbs
Nothing real can be threatened, nothing unreal exists
Therein lies the piece of God.
I always knew he was a prophet, but I couldn't find a decent job.
Daaaaaaaamn Daniel
The FBI continues to take them to all the white trucks.
Better to know who you are
When you look in the mirror
I'm getting off the enemy
Ridin 'with my niggas
Because all that glitters is not gold
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's going on
Rolling smoke, high, high, high
Just another day going by, by, by
For every known rat, it falls asleep
For every loyal nigga up front, you still owned
So let's blow this money while we pour bottles
Let me drop another classic and follow a tour
Let's get drunk and let the whores swallow
My niggas hug the guns and ignore the Bibles
Not to glorify it, you can't ignore the lines
The new jury may be you, law-abiding ghetto
Better to know who looks in the mirror
The truth lies, and your soul cannot see it more clearly
Better to know who you are
Because all that glitters is not gold
I'm getting off the enemy
Ridin 'with my niggas
I'm getting low, hold me from the enemies
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's going on
Rolling smoke, high, high, high
Just another day going by, by, by
I can't leave him alone, I can't leave him alone
They are handing out soccer numbers after touching your phone
Or are you watching the drop while clapping, chrome
I took a brick and turned it into stone
5 in 10, the return of the clones
Then I took my experience and turned it into poems
Panamera blood red symbolizes bloodshed
Few still remember CL
Selling Pete Rock, crossing them V-12
When you look in the mirror
Because all that glitters is not gold
I'm getting off the enemy
Cameras in action, tell all my niggas what's going on
Ridin 'with my niggas
Because all that glitters is not gold
Cameras in action, tell my niggas what's going on
Just another day going by, by, by
Hahaha
Meat is best served as a steak: well done
Get a gun to your face, bitch nigga
The meat will make you pray to God
Move your children, are you hiding your mother?
Meat is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they're not murderers, they're not pulling their triggers, fucking niggas
Beef will have you locking up our cars
Those niggas don't die for you
Those niggas don't die for you
Taking half of everything you get

That's signed with three niggas, now that's bad luck
Damn that shit, even the odds now
You better sell this hard now
You call it living your dreams
You can't fly without your wings
You get it
Jeremy Scott is all camouflaged
You can't hide from yourselves, sabotaged in your career
I was really at that Travelodge
You only lie through your catalogs
Where the blood and the battle scars
Put me to the body, nigga
The first 48 put bodies on us, nigga
We don't play around here
A to K that, spray that, lie down
You can keep your heartbeat nigga
We'd rather share your bitch, nigga, bitch nigga
3 million can't hide that
It shows in the houses I made that I tried
Fuck you playing games for
They got you talking about that big shit
They niggas use you as a pawn
You see they never loaded their weapons
Now you're here alone
Ask Steve Jobs, Wealth Doesn't Buy Health
Meat is best served as a steak: well done
Get a gun to your face, bitch nigga
Move your children, are you hiding your mother?
Meat is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they're not murderers, they're not pulling their triggers, fucking niggas
Beef will have you locking up our cars
Broken heart, yours doesn't look like ours
Those niggas don't die for you
Those niggas don't die for you
Throwing that flag running around you, hot shit
Taking half of everything you get
Yeah those niggas don't die for you
Those niggas don't die for you
And we know that
What is beef? Meat is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Meat is when your moms are not safe on the streets
Meat is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU once again
What is beef? Meat is when you need 2 Gats to go to sleep
Meat is when your moms are not safe on the streets
Meat is when I see you
I'm feeling, pause!
One more cup and I could take off
It seems that the haters never take a night off
But you know I tell them they can get lost
Because I feel in myself, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I don't know them, but I'm leaving, because I feel
Oh what a feeling, the champagne is pouring
All this dirty money showered me with millions
The driver of that car was not made for a roof
But I'm soft and white and soft as my pillow
Feeling so if he knows how we know
Cross that line and shoot like a free kick
Under bright lights, middle finger to hate
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I feel
Baby take your chance no matter what you're listening to
I can change your life tell me what you are comparing
I put you on the red carpet, tell them what you're wearing
Buy until you fall, they say sharing is loving
And I could see us fly, the sky is the limit
We are so real, I have my own mill room
Counting money in bed, watching Deal or No Deal
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I feel
I propose a toast to every living king
Smart enough to delegate his work to his wing man
Hold a bad bitch in the arm of my shiny hand
Play my cards right, now I'm looking at a dream hand
Yeah i got you looking at my poker face
No joker sees it, you can call me Smoking Ace
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I feel
I'm feeling, pause
I'm more handcuffed and could take off
But you know I tell them they can get lost
Because i'm feeling
This is my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I don't know about you, but I'm leaving
Because i'm feeling
Oh what a feeling
Champagne spills
All this dirty money made me bathe in millions
I came out unscathed from the days of my treatment
The driver of that car was not made for a roof
Still in my boy
It smells like a kilo
Cross that line and shoot like a free kick
Middle finger for those who hate
Just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I feel
I'm feeling, pause
I'm more handcuffed and could take off
It seems that the haters never take a night off
But you know I tell them they can get lost
Because i'm feeling
This is my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I don't know about you, but I'm leaving
Because i'm feeling
They say that sharing is caring
More than my earnings
Like little steps
We can share beginnings
Walk before run but she's so independent
And I could see us fly
The sky is the limit
We are so real
I have my own mill room
Counting money in bed
Seeing agreement or I don't try
In a perfect world
Just my guns and my girl
I'm feeling, pause
I'm more handcuffed and could take off
But you know I tell them they can get lost
Because i'm feeling
I'm going to the ball like I'm seven feet tall
I don't know about you, but I'm leaving
Because i'm feeling
I propose a toast
To every living kingpin smart enough to delegate his work to his wing
Man keep a bad bitch on my bling's arm and play my cards right
Yeah i got you looking at my poker face
No joker sees it
We shine like diamonds and pearls and I feel
I'm feeling, pause
I'm more handcuffed and could take off
It seems that the haters never take a night off
Because I feel, it's my world
They tried to tie me to the BALCO
Too many clicks in dial tone
I am the hawk Willy of my city
How niggas celebrating Alpo?
Rustic interior, tight mustard-colored wall
Catch doors everywhere
Macs come out of the flat, dinners at Forge
Four Seasons the four seasons
It's good to have a getaway for no reason
The concierge never speaks
I could travel to El Barrio
To get it from Daddy-O then bye
Cell phone in the backyard
I didn't have to make a cameo to get it out
I hope you bet on the sleeper
It all started in a search
Until I get out of the stands
Drug money kicked like it's FIFA
Yuugh! Appears as dandruff
Beverly Hills Jed Clampett
A shotgun wedding to collect my ransom
Cameo Chris Hansen
I'm at your door
You don't want to know him if you owe him
I ended up in cars and had to tow them
I did it on the lawn when they weren't cut
Even hogtied wives, I had to show them
I mean business
I mean everything I say, without a witness
Unforgiven, Souls of Evil
It's in infinity, my arms are infinite
Your arms too short to box with God
I could send a bitch an Elie Saab
She fucks and steals
10 thousand dollars just for touching work
At close range, she doesn't duck and dodge
You can't trust them
It all started in a search
Now they ask about the function
Until I get out of the stands
Drug money kicked like it's FIFA
I hope you bet on the sleeper
It all started in a search
Until I get out of the stands
I'm feeling, Pause!
It seems that the haters never take a night off
But you know I tell them they can get lost
Because I'm feeling, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm going to the ball like I'm 7 feet tall
Oh what a feeling, the champagne is pouring
All this dirty money showered me with millions
I came out unscathed from the days of my treatment
Still in my boy, smelling like a kilo
But I'm sad and soft white like my pillow
Cross that line and shoot like a free kick
He prefers to burn on the tables in Las Vegas
Under bright lights, middle finger to hate
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feeling
I'm feeling, Pause!
One more cup and I could take off
It seems that the haters never take a night off
But you know I tell them they can get lost
Because I'm feeling, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm going to the ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about you, but I'm going to get off, because I'm feeling
Baby take your chance no matter what you're listening to
I can change your life tell me what you are comparing
I put you on the red carpet, tell them what you're wearing
More on my earnings, we can share opinions, like small steps
We can share the beginnings, walk before running, but she is very independent
We are so real, I have my own mill room
Counting money in bed, watching Deal no Deal
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feeling
I'm feeling, Pause!
One more cup and I could take off
It seems that the haters never take a night off
But you know I tell them they can get lost
Because I'm feeling, it's my world
I'm going to the ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about you, but I'm going to get off, because I'm feeling
I propose a toast to every living king
Smart enough to delegate his work to his wing man
Hold a bad bitch in the arm of my shiny hand
Yeah i got you looking at my poker face
In a perfect world, just my guns and my girl
We shine like diamonds and pearls, and I'm feeling
I'm feeling, Pause!
One more cup and I could take off
It seems that the haters never take a night off
But you know I tell them they can get lost
Because I'm feeling, it's my world
I'm spending money like a rich white girl
I'm going to the ball like I'm 7 feet tall
I don't know about you, but I'm going to get off, because I'm feeling
Something about my life
Not in the same class
Not on the same flight
Maybe the same club
They just aren't the same lights
They both fuck the same bitch
It's just not the same night
You just took his phone number
I took her home with her
Another bitch
Household
Boomerang
Stron'jay
Lipstick on my neck
I son - little
Keep drinking that Andre
He spent 3 accumulations, that's Andre
That Balmain
That Phillip Lim
They say I dress like Kanye
I am everything my rhymes say:
Support of the family
Brand owner
Play cloths
Millionaire
I hope your bitch doesn't fall for it
Drink in his hand with the sand on him
You niggas off the couch, we stand on it
* # &% #
Drug money with a gang
D-boys keep playing the same
I just got a little glamor
CURSE!
I've been on the road
But now I'm back again
I brought my little friend
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
You mean more to me in this world
I've been thinking a lot
You probably think they're my girls
But when you have love
It's not like you don't call home
And the conclusion I came to is, baby, I'm leaving
Last night I thought if this should end
So tonight, I go out with my friends
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Ooh, you should think about what you did wrong
If you love me
Ooh, what a shame I had to write this song
Better luck with your next girlfriend.
I should start a new life
So tonight, I go out with my friends, we go out
And I'm starting a new life, we're hanging
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Pusha, I finally came back to you two years later, the break was hell
Eggshell whites, I had them boys on my tail
The truth, now you don't have to question what I sell
When it comes to fucking flow, I'm the hottest round
Condos, fast cars, that's Miami heat
If you know it ended Shaq, we have the floor seats
What talkin '' bout? All that hair and all that wear
BAPE, BBC, Three Dots and everything in there
I spent Green Mayne on that Bling chain
Make you scream like Ying Yang's dumb black
Green as the great Grinch's fist stole Christmas
Time up again and it's the work we get
Fresh out of the wire, Faith tells them what they're thinking.
Last night I thought if this should end
I should start a new life
So tonight, I go out with my friends, we go out
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
Me and my girls will go out tonight
I build it better nigga ten times
The Enzo Ferrari
The Kenzo-inspired template
The ceiling is like Ghostface, can it be that simple?
40 keys in a rental
My dogs bring it back, now you name a better kennel
I keep cash, case Feds connect me
The children of the case kidnap me, the children can recover me
He doesn't care about your rap meat
Poetic justice looking at you sock puppets
Arizona brick is 26 years old and they love it
You will not covet what you cannot budget
Damn, I got my boys covered
Fuck it, I've got the drug boys covered
Fuck it, I've got the drug boys covered
Arizona brick is 26 years old and they love it
Phone trap, gun on your spine
Graduated from the corner where the crack is pulled
Talk to your mom again now you're acting adult
Listening to Young Dolph until the pack is finished
I relate to them
I'm a Pyrex God, shit, I'm cool to them
You all niggas quote all the wrong numbers
Push all the wrong bitches
And follow the wrong niggas
Any hot rapper right now
I gave everyone the game that is decoded
The only thing left is to cultivate it
Everything is hustlin ', so leave vu
I'm dying for that money like a bank is hit
Damn, I got my boys covered
Damn, I got my boys covered
Fuck it, I've got the drug boys covered
Fuck it, I've got the drug boys covered
Arizona brick is 26 years old and they love it
I play too emo, I'm also Nino
I must remain discreet, I play Reno
I am also Pesci, also Casino
We Sinatra, Sammy, Tell us
Extravagant, so illegal
So Carlito, then Pacino
We drink wine, the grapes of wrath
The money counter runs until it breaks in half
Coupes the flagship, feels like a futon
Palm changing paddle, abusing the red line
The house is ranch style, reflects the pool.
Dust paved the way, the sword has two sides
Duffle hundred bands, trunk is 2-5
The mules are flying, the journey from Tucson
The dash is hollowed out, we shorten the fuel line
Fuck it, I've got the drug boys covered
Fuck it, I've got the drug boys covered
Arizona brick is 26 years old and they love it
Everything dem a gwaan dem heart softer than clay
None of them have the guts to lift it up and spray
None of them have the guts to burst the SK
I have dollars in my block
Serve it to my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to the Lord in my shotta
She be suitable
Yes that's my flocka
All praise to the highest on both sides
I pray to God, I pray for much, I will not lie
Multi because I'm high, convo and a boat ride
Yuugh, my records don't have to sell, nigga
Woo, get out of my cell, nigga
I dance hard, you ride the bank, so fuck off
No Soundscan for a bricklayer, square nigga, you're an enemy of bricks
Where I'm from, we go crazy with them
I have dollars in my block
Serve it to my flocka
Yes that's my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to the Lord in my shotta
She be suitable
Yes that's my flocka
Welcome to my block, look at my world
Diamond on my block, all we got is white girl
All we got is choppas, all you hear is choppas
All we see is choppas, that focus on my blocka
Dopeboy to the rescue, bad bitches get the best view
Lots of money just floating around, all hoes feel special
Woo, I know the rent past due, fuck me good and it ships through
The third time you used the line, damn it, she's a pimp too
Teamwork makes the dream work, all my niggas have done the job seen
All my niggas couldn't make it through, so much death that my dreams hurt
Where I'm from, we go crazy with them
Sell drugs, go diamond in my block
I have dollars in my block
Serve it to my flocka
Yes that's my flocka
To my flocka
Pray to the Lord in my shotta
Never trust a bitch who finds love on camera
She will fuck you, then she will turn around and fuck a janitor
Set the parameters
Whether with professional players or amateurs
I won't let you ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the boy
Good morning, Matt Lauer; I can live?
Look at my new digs
The rooftop can hold a painting and a sip for 40
The Warhols on my wall paint a war story
I had to find other ways to invest
It's a nightmare yeah
I still do the Fred Astaire on a brick
Tap-tap, drop the phone if you hear it click
Art Basel-in 'the bezel
Your fall is broken and does not match the metal
The lower level is where you settle
I'm the pot calling the black teapot
Between God and where the devil is
I had to fold Dutch and fold again
Then hopscotch through where the problem is
Exactly what the game has been missing
This fire burns like hell's kitchen
Push!
Now this is how the ting goes, I'm back from Santo Domingo
Now this is how the ting goes, I'm back from Santo Domingo
From Honda deals to Grammy Awards
That's where the kings go
I can blow a million dollars in powder
God knows how many bottles I've made bust
Still running through the models like I'm Puff (M-M-M—)
Confront my problems like I'm Ralo in the bluff
Relaxing in a rock filled condo ready
My amputee friend but will represent something
I'm dying to find a way to get a Grammy (Maybach Music)
Looking at my success, for some it is bittersweet
Always keep the shooter triggers adjusted
Diamonds dripping down on me through Tiffany
All these K-9 units still sniff me
Ignorance versus innocence
Not the temperature for you in Timberlands
I keep the coldest flows in the hot seat (M-M-M—)
And you can see my hoes by your car keys
Another episode full of atrocities.
It's double M, baby, money monopolies (Maybach Music)
You are afraid to see my face in a fancy place
So why debate my case against a Nancy Grace?
Still practical, fool, press your luck (M-M—)
Your money is gone every two months
My money is long, so the treasure is hidden
Now this is how the ting goes, I'm back from Santo Domingo
Because that's where the kings go, in Santo Domingo
That's where the kings go
Earmuffs
Half a year later, a bigger album still isn't heard (me)
The natives want me out of the office, back on the sidewalk (me)
The jokers at the top know that the king is nothing to play with (me)
9 to 5 money is as sweet as serious change (me)
The president, Blobama, blow for you
Chopper by my side in every photo, Osama
Oh mom, they question my starting lineup
You only find a diamond digging like coal miners
Don't listen to them, Desiigner
Daddy Chanel hats, but you don't know they have them
Then you'll never see me as you spin the mall
Emblem scrolls, Virginian black
Come to a neighborhood where I don't mix
Album of the year contender every year
The kitchen is full of work, it's mixing everywhere
Bitches mixed everywhere that do more
They never saw him with him, so they fuck his ghost
Invisible man, watch with invisible hands.
MJ, remember the time they counted in the hourglass
But mine comes with a bag and heels
And the DIY Gucci with the shield and shields.
It has gone too far when the most real is not real
I walk through the clouds so your roofs aren't real
These Call of Duty niggas make their murders not real
John Grisham's rap
The bar is down, the well is dry
They're looking for tunes, but no, not me (yeah)
Look, I'm so top 5
If you consider the truth, it could be overlooked
Blobama
I sold more drugs than I sold records
So I don't hear any of that street shit
Because in my mind, motherfuckers sold soap
He got rich selling hope to the desperate
I motive to put my niggas on motors
Like Scarface but it's the face of God in that mirror
We were created in his image, marking and it is much clearer
Aria, blonde hair, blue eyes like the Führer
Judge and jury, crazy jewelery froze
Watercolors on my neck, shit rhymes when you blind niggas
We are not the same color clarity of diamond, black
No i have nothing in common with you
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin.
They are tipping the scales for these cookies to win
Not reading, not writing, made us wild with men
They pray for jail but I master the pen
Just give me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that seems, listen to my passion again
It was never my dream, immaculate victory
I was peeing my shorts, having rich black thoughts
I wish I had a gun before all the friends I made fought
During the night I saw a black man go find a career
Young King buries me inside a glass coffin
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new place
From top to bottom, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled rebellious, nigga rise to my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
I built a school in Ethiopia, I should enroll myself
God body and mind, food for the soul.
When you feed on hate, you're empty, my nigga, it shows
If you slip and fall, I've got you, my nigga, wait
If you're right or wrong, if you're riding, come on
At the end of this song, I can't hide for long
I saw how they killed children, assaulted black grandmothers
Copy a kilo and have people on top of your house
Follow the codes, there is no love for these hoes
If you slip you fall, I have you, my nigga, wait
If you're right or wrong, if you're riding, come on
At the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, wait
I have you, my nigga, wait
If you're right or wrong, if you're riding, come on
At the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, wait
I have you, my nigga, wait
I have you, my nigga, wait
I have you, my nigga, wait
I have you, my nigga, wait
I sold more drugs than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold drugs
So I don't hear any of that street shit
Because in my mind, mothafuckas sold soap
He got rich selling hope to the desperate
But I am a thinker, methodical in my motives.
I motive to put my niggas on motors
Like Scarface but it's the face of God in that mirror
We were created in his image, marking and it is much clearer
Scoring from above but I wanted my purest
Aria, blonde hair, blue eyes like the Führer
Judge and jury, crazy jewelery froze
Watercolors on my neck, rhyme when you fuck niggas
We are not the same color clarity of diamond, black
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin.
Not reading, not writing, made us wild with men
They pray for jail but I master the pen
Descendant of kings, we're on it again
Everything that seems, listen to my passion again
It was never my dream, immaculate victory
I wish I had a gun before all the friends I made fought
During the night I saw a black man go find a career
Two weeks later I had to be that carrier boy
Young King buries me inside a glass coffin
Windex cleanses me for life later
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new place
Four chains, large studs, one black also flies
From top to bottom, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled rebellious, nigga rise to my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my newspaper, I couldn't understand my wealth
I built a school in Ethiopia, I should enroll myself
God body and mind, food for the soul.
When you feed on hate, you're empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, there is no love for these hoes
If you slip and fall, I got you my nigga, wait
If you are right or wrong, if you are riding come on
At the end of this song, I can't hide for long
I saw how they killed children, assaulted black grandmothers
Launch a gang cartel, dare you do something about it?
Fuck with the foams, when you take the house
Follow the codes, there is no love for these hoes
If you slip you fall, I have you, my nigga, wait
If you are right or wrong, if you are riding come on
At the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, wait
This track dictates everything I'm supposed to say
So have mercy on this soul that I've thrown away
Although it's a cliche, the devil caught me
This greedy motherfucker couldn't take the hit
Bitches blowing kisses and rappers making speeches
You will make me carry these arms like a Chippendale
Press on him, leave the cross on him
By the time the bodies discovered that there was peat on him
I could show you all the ways crime pays
Two ranch houses, both on the dock
The poison in the car is not carbon monoxide
So he begs forgiveness for the same reason that he forgave me
I wasn't madly poor, I see I was lazier
A thousand kilos cross their lines that you cannot ignore
I felt entitled to it, not like the Bible does
My shining eyes exposed to how the bell idols do it
I only took a page, then I went on stage
Then put that Rollie's face in that diamond cage
I tried to tame the beast, better I couldn't strap
I passed the test of time, airtight without leaks
Not a shriek, not a word
I have lived half my life within the reach of a bird
Could have measured six feet or had nurses
It was written like these Bible verses tattooed on me.
I feel the weight on my shoulders like the church is on me
I'm forgiven
You don't do all the shit I did and you manage to get through and not be forgiven
This is the wrath of Caine's motherfuckers
Let this stop you
It's just a snack
Haha!
Re-Up Gang Forever
Good music
Dope boys around the world
My name is my name
Pullin 'on that new toy
That rockstar boy's doll as Pink Floyd
Escaped the plug also as Trugoy
Imagine me boy you could never do what I do boy
Still, duckling shit I made, boy
Niggas in Paris' first hit-boy
Shit can get dirtier than light boy
Don't take this kind of risk, boy
Because this boy has been pulling that D likes Rich Boy
You got lost, boy; The numbers don't add up in the coup
If you know you know
If you know you know
A fraternity of drug dealers echoing
I'm just a former student
Too legitimate, they still look at me with one eye
The company I have is not corporate enough
Rebel child soldier, you're not orphaned enough
A rapper turned trapper can't transform into us
But a trapper-turned-rapper can transform into a Puff
Smoking dance contest.
I predict snow, Al Roker
(If you know, you know)
I have only admired Sosa
You all have a bird, this black Oprah
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Train from the side of the ball courts
(If you know, you know)
A stop like a Walmart
We have tennis balls for the wrong sport
If you know about the garage
The hatch is supposed to be uncomfortable
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason why we play
Circle twice for bis
(If you know, you know)
Ever hit you with the weight of the water
Then he had to weigh, "War or wait?"
(If you know, you know)
When we all click like Golden State
(If you know, you know)
I've been granting wishes like a genius
I've been hiding where you can see me
Only responsible for showing rappers how to stand
On the front line when hunters started throwing bands
Where were you when Big Meech brought the tigers?
Because I was busy winning stripes like a tiger's skin
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Train from the side of the ball courts
(If you know, you know)
A stop like a Walmart
(If you know, you know)
The hatch is supposed to be uncomfortable
(If you know, you know)
Circle around twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)
Pullin 'on that new toy
That rockstar boy's doll as Pink Floyd
Saying hi to the rude boy, I'm saying hi boy
Escaped the plug also as Trugoy
Imagine me boy you could never do what I do boy
Still, duckling shit I made, boy
Niggas in Paris' first hit-boy
These ain't the same kind of hitting, boy
Shit can get dirtier than light boy
Don't take this kind of risk, boy
Because this boy has been pulling that D likes Rich Boy
You got lost, boy; The numbers don't add up in the coup
That was ten years ago, if you know it, you know it (Yes)
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Train from the side of the ball courts
(If you know, you know)
This thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours
I'm just a former student
The company I have is not corporate enough
Rebel child soldier, you're not orphaned enough
A rapper turned trapper can't transform into us
Smoking dance contest.
I predict snow, Al Roker
(If you know, you know)
You all have a bird, this black Oprah
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Train from the side of the ball court
(If you know, you know)
We have tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason why we play
(If you know, you know)
Then he had to weigh, "War or wait?"
(If you know, you know)
When we all click like Golden State
And you and your team are the caravan
(If you know, you know)
I've been hiding where you can see me
The skybox is right next to RiRi
On the front line when hunters started throwing bands
Where were you when Big Meech brought the tigers?
Because I was busy winning stripes like a tiger's skin
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Train from the side of the ball court
A stop like a Walmart
We have tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know about the garage
The hatch is supposed to be uncomfortable
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason why we play
He grabbed all the wheels at a Flex car show
I declare war, letting all rappers know
Checkered flag shit, matching bag shit
Monaco Grand Prix, fast backward
Don C paired with python accents
Some things don't change, your life is not like mine
Closed motorized blinds
I got a stamp and a stamp, daddy notarized mines
B.O. double S, that Camaro is not mine
That Phantom has double breasted
When Dame left the bag with the records
Infrared, yes, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yes, you know what I mean?
The game is screwed
Niggas 'beats is bangin', nigga, you already won it
The letter that pennin 'equals the wins they win
The big question is how the Russians did it.
It was written as Nas, but it came from Quentin
When the CEO is blinded by brightness, it's different
Believe in me and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play their roles and tricks.
Shit, remember that Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they don't even recognize Hov until "Annie"
Because I'm willing to juggle these flows and the nose candy (yeah)
Tom brady, niggas, I had to run away
These waves are riding, I took off my sandals
Latin boss my Grammy, I went the Spanish route
Oh, now is it okay to kill Baby?
Niggas looked at me crazy like he really killed a baby
I greet Ross because the message was pure
Flash without fire
Another multi-platinum rapper caught and can't retreat
Niggas get exposed, I see the cracks and I'm the liar?
Now who do you admire?
Prices are not real without inflation
I blew it up, I made it grow, I was a conduit
Moynat got into my bitches, I blew it
Look through it, neck, match it
Speak in Spanish, me and you
Let Steven speak the streaming numbers and Shazam
I will make sure that you receive every gram of us
We are going to enter numbers, easily
The only rapper who sold more drugs than me was Eazy-E
How could you correct these errors?
When don't you even write your songs?
Push
Infrared, yes, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yes, you know what I mean?
Infrared, yes, you know what I mean?
I left, I left, can you hear me?
I left
If you have a whip out right now
And really from that life
Put your keys in the air right now, damn
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Riding on that Lambo, riding on that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Oh my god i'm in this ho
Oh my god i'm in this ho
Oh my god i am oh my god i am
Oh my god i'm in this ho
In this ho, I'm in this ho
That Louie and my cologne when I travel in that Lambo
Assault rifles in the back like Rambo
Woah, I'm pulling that shit
Four fifty-eight in that bitch
Doors that rise above that shit
Ho, you see the shit on my wrist
Oh my god i'm in this ho oh my god i'm in this ho
Yeah i'm fucking that center page
Fuck everyone in my business for
You're not talking about getting dough
You're not talking about getting more
That is the difference between rich and poor.
Acknowledge that I put that first place in jeopardy and they testify
They ate first and I'm next in line
We go back and he passes the baton
I put my chest on that finish line
This art money, this Renaissance
My heavy chain, it's winter
See all colors, this Benetton
Vroom, vroom, I ride like wheels
Swizz I'm back on my shit
Haters, I have to suck my dick
I'm riding on that Countach
Candy paint on that Countach
Weird way, I'm in weird action
I'm back, I'm like Michael Jackson
Court! Michael Jackson
Wait a minute let me slow it down
For you dumb niggas, I'll slow it down
I get the paper, you know it now
I get the paper, you know it now
But I'm about to get another one, you little bastards
Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I'm just trying to find my way out of this fucking kitchen
Turn one by two now the kilo has a brother
Father knows best, wash my hands, everything is forgiven
We raise dust like the floors of the coliseum
Walls full of safes like mausoleum doors
Scholarships, Jacksons, there's no place for George
Yeh, fear of God is in you muthafuckas
This art imitates my life
Your world famous Hip Hop based on imitation white
Eliminate fool's gold and imitation ice
Every penny I made in this life was not disastrous
Help my young bitch see my way through the singles
I sent my old bitch back to find her Masters
What goes around comes around, this is the wheel of life
Grab and pull back the wheel
While parallel parking, Kentucky Derby grilled
The fact that I'm free lets me know that God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers speak crowns but I'd rather speak of fear
No weapon forged against me will prosper
Hakuna matata, feet up drinking java
Strolling through the totem survey, what is my only problem?
Scroll through my Rolodex, who will carry my child
So many hands raised as the band plays
I'm here now, see how many nigga plans change
First class flights, Ciroc soaked nights
Wake up the models, what a fucking life
Big up di numba one awtist inna di rap game, Pusha T
I waa unnu kno seh nuhbody nah fuck wid da bwoy yah on or off the music
Say money nah stop running
Nuhbody nuh ave di letters, nuh body nuh ave di style or fashion weh him have
Fi he program classifies different from unnu
Unnu a ramp business, who can?
The dead has arisen
Although my niggas are still in prison
Until they are free, no one is forgiven
It's just a mission, it's just a magician
All-Star's in Houston this year, I'm still fishing
The Outlet Playground Where Hoes Play
Galleria, Mr. Trick Bag when I'm in town
Vengeance is mine, says the Lord
Shoot the niggas because I'm bored and they are whores (Damn!)
I'll bow down until I'm crowned king of New Orleans
Now everyone is inspired by the 80s and 90s
Your laptop is hot, only the internet is hot
Down-low for downloads don't get caught in my storm (Don't do it)
Fuck nigga, you're just porn on the internet
Now we don't have to pretend anymore, the line is drawn
I'm too drug dealer for rap niggas
Too close to every nigga trap
I'm just preaching facts, nigga
I'm more predisposed to Coca-Cola Coupe drivers
Debut Prelude, My Name Is My Name
God!
I've been in this rap game for a long time
Sometimes all you need is an opportunity
What you're about to hear are ten drug artists
From across the country, fighting for his shot.
What you are about to hear is something special.
I'm Pusha-T, and this is: 1800 seconds (Yuugh!)
Wait, come here, who do you want to be? Drug dealer? Demon? Rap nigga? Are you trying to save culture? Oh Lord. You have to choose one, daddy
Leave your conscience at the door
We already hid the monsters on the floor
I talk to the cheating lords
I've already been black
And I never cared because I'm Jack Frost
Of selling that explosion
Where talent meets time
Christopher Wallace, think big, keep climbing
Reasonable doubts, drug era, keep going up
I am my brother's keeper, Lord Willin ', keep grindin'
Still held back, I paid with my skin
The only thing missing is a cape over me
You niggas wanna tag late, cool on me
I put fears on my peers, I heard my footsteps come from the back
Now murder was the case, buddy
I'm watching this three ring circus
Old lions don't roar, so clowns aren't nervous
Even you fools have a purpose
Let them run at full speed until the king rises
Then he goes off with his head
They take samples of them, I make examples of them
It's the thrill of the hunt, I keep my cloak covered
Ask "Who is the truest loyalty?"
Ask P, who is the main drug dealer
The only cool thing I haven't improved was J. Dilla
Prepare for the crown placement.
Just remember last year right now
We were in a fucking cage, okay?
(Do you remember
I would like to forget that)
I say be happy with what you have
(Be happy
I want what comes to me)
Oh well, what's up?
(The boy of the world
And everything in it)
It's like a bitch you can't shake
Sleeping with the best
Thread count has no links
Cocaine security blanket, I'm Linus
In this weather, Im Kareem Burke tied
Roc's silent partner, I will not throw the diamond
Throwing the Sherwin, necklaces above, bottles above
Sparkles at the table, made them feel like Merlin
Whirlwind, dust makes your world go round
Updated that, updated that
Blue suffocation, inside potato sacks
Yeah talk money I'm made of it
Cocaine parties, like the 70s, I attend that
Do you know what fame is?
Do you know what pain is?
Rinse 2 bricks and make a black try to drain it down the drain
Look at my face on the news and it's not Tivo
I still want to sell kilos
It is as if he threw stones at the corral begging for the rich man
I still want to sell kilos
Looking for the fish scale like I'm trying to find Nemo
I still want to sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still want to sell kilos
I grew up watching mom repoed car
A little nigga looking through the hole
How do you think I felt knowing Dad wasn't there
Recycle cans because nobody cared
Get it how you live it always echoed on the streets
When we talk about business, stop talking on the phone
Join puzzles to solve homocides?
Dice game talk, better get your hiding place
Red Velor, I'm in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
Violin butt a real nigga sell yayo
Show them all love, bitches fuck aside
Rolls Royce corniche, trunk full of work
Look at my face on the news and it's not Tivo
I still want to sell kilos
Looking for the fish scale like I'm trying to find Nemo
I still want to sell kilos
That's what happens when you Michael and they try to treat you like Tito
I still want to sell kilos
Top Testarossa, G4s, Gucci models pass the fold
Everything I upload, I win
All black label, logos on the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe pushes poison like a copper head
Powdered smoke is cleared through the undead
Bottles of roses are poured for the champions
You think it was a Grammy victory
The celebration extends in the morning like an ambion
Rocking chain, ticker tape like your Mardi Gras
A thousand niggas deep, they never needed a bodyguard
Thousands of keys I'm about to do pilates on
Where the kings crowned like a grill a Maseratis in
Candy parked, doors ajar, in a stripper
Cocaine storage
Liva living dreams, already DeLoreans entering
It's like a bitch you can't shake
I still want
Sleep with the best, thread count has no link
Cocaine security blanket, I'm Linus
In this weather, I'm Kareem Burke bound
The silent companion of the Roc, I will not throw the diamond
Sparkles at the table, made him feel like Merlin
Whirlwind, dust makes your world go round
Learn from OGs, Alfa Romeos and Sterlings
Yeah talk money shit I'm made of it
Cocaine parties like the 70s, I attend that
Do you know what fame is?
Sitting with the woman of your dreams and forgetting her name
Do you know what pain is?
Rinse two bricks and try to get a nigga to tighten the drain
Look at my face on the news and it's not Tivo'd
I still want to sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the Pen asking Rico
I still want to sell kilos
I still want to sell kilos
I grew up watching mom's car repo'd
A little nigga looking through the hole
How do you think I felt knowing Dad wasn't there
Recycle cans because nobody cared
Get it how you live it always echoed on the streets
When we talk about business, stop talking on the phone
Federals who listen to conversations through my OnStar
Dice game talk, better get your hiding place
Red velvet, I'm in the white glass house
Half a ticket bitches quick to drop it on the scale
Drug town where the real nigga sells yay '
Every day a black man dies and we can't ask why
Showing more love to the bitches fucked aside
I still want to sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the Pen asking Rico
I still want to sell kilos
I still want to sell kilos
That is what happens when Michael
And they try to treat you like Tito
Top models from Testarossa, G4s
Gucci passes the fold, everything I climb, I win
Richard Mille Tourbillon, remarkable moment
All black label, logos on the lining
Dust falls, smoke disappears among the living dead
You'd think it was a Grammy win, the celebration spills
During the morning like an Ambien, bitches love my vibe
Rocking chain, ticker tape like Mardi Gras
A thousand niggas deep, they never needed a bodyguard
A thousand ki in which I am about to do Pilates
Use the king's crown as the grill a Maserati is on
Catty corner parked, doors ajar, in a stripper
He blew out a fuse and lit a body, storing cocaine
Liva lives dreams, all of you DeLoreans is coming
Look at my face on the news and it's not Tivo'd
I still want to sell kilos
It's like I'm throwing rocks at the Pen asking Rico
I still want to sell kilos
Looking for the fish scale like I'm trying to find Nemo

Updated that, updated that
Blue suffocation in the inner potato sack
Yeah talk money I'm made of it
Cocaine parties like the 70s, I attend that

Do you know what pain is?
Rinse 2 bricks and make a black try to drain it down the drain

Drug town a real nigga sell yayo
Every day a black man dies and we can't ask why
Show them all love, the bitches fucked off to the side
Rolls Royce Corniche, trunk full of work
Top Testarossa, G4s, Gucci models pass the fold
Everything I upload, I win
All black label, logos on the lining
Bell Biv DeVoe pushes poison like a copper head
Dust fall, the smoke disappears among the undead
Bottles of roses pour for the champions
You would think it was a Grammy victory
The celebration extends in the morning like an Ambien
Bitches love my vibe
Rocking chain, ticker tape like Mardi Gras
A thousand niggas deep, they never needed a bodyguard
Where the kings crowned like the grill on which was a Maserati
Cocaine storage, Liva living dreams, all of you DeLoreans coming in
They call him crack dealer, I'm like Warhol
A nigger paints a picture of a bullet for all of you
My sophomore Jinx is more minks
But only for my mother will she use them as sofa covers
You niggas making my All-Star weekends cheaper
If you can't swim at the bottom then look nigga
Yuugh! And I never had to see nigga
Rich or rich, choose your poison
I think I paid for a lot of abortions
Another Celine, it's like a routine.
It's like a waist trainers Ferris wheel and seven jeans
Your new body is in my new body
Do it in an hourglass which is my new hobby
Rich nigga shit, how I blew my first million
Fortunately there was something on the roof, keep negotiating
Speak numbers, but never tell me
When you're the link to what fits in the keyhole
The real nigga of the marathon in RICO
The last cocaine superhero
I put on the cape to cover kilos
The villain wins, the evolution of Nino
Nah, although you're not talking to me
The Robb Snort Report
Lawyers are bought
Palms are greased when cases are fought
It's not a crime what the fuck are you saying to me
Reduced to simple assault
It's hard to keep it quiet
It was just us
I ended up selling my Bat Mobile
Shock does not kill
This is how you survive it
You couldn't miss a Super Bowl or a Cancun
Bitches don't respect niggas that ain't in full bloom
So the neck is a full moon
And loving Alaia pumps
Rich nigga shit, how I lost my second million
Luckily there was something on the ceiling, keep dealing with you
Speak numbers, but never tell me
When you're the link to what fits in the keyhole
The last cocaine superhero
I put on the cape to cover kilos
The villain wins, the evolution of Nino
Nah, although you're not talking to me
Ten toes in the trap, nigga, I'm fine here
Feel like Tony reading words on the Goodyear
So there is no threat, follow your steps with all the hood there
Kerosene in a 20 ounce Polish Spring
Nothing to lose attitude like Ron from Arizona
It's a homicide when I slide over you
Reporting live from the project banks
Hella caine, cellophane drug, dirty syringes
Heron zombies walking down the street in three week binges
The clientele looks like the video "Thriller" in 3D glasses
COD, niggas never had to face me with my jaws
I'm weighing bricks on the scale where they put the lunch meat
I'm Nino Brown on projects.
Yes, Curtis Jackson in his pyrex.
Getting rich or dying trying is my mindset
Cause I never see a Brinks truck following a hearse
I never see a dead man on the stand
I never see a nigga swallow a bullet
And live to talk about it
You saw me go through hell, now watch me come out
Nigga shit, that's how I lost three million
Unpolished, no apology
This cocaine cowboy pushed us to the limit.
You thought Tony in that cell would have made us shy
We find your old cell, bitch, we dig through the digits
Anything Spanish made me speak Spanglish
Money is universal, that's the only language
The dream is not to die, just some real niggas
Left behind by parents who wouldn't build with us
I have both of mine at home, let's still be real niggas
My best half chose a better path, applaud it
Younger brother - I, a spoiled child, fought against him
I heard the Devil's new playground is boredom
The top of California falls like fall
And they say I'm about to win
I will claim victory when Malice is about to sin
Old habits die hard, the rainy day bag buried in the backyard
It is heaven for a hustla, there are no cemeteries
Cause niggas standing up don't lie on any floor
Much more burns us, ashes to ashes
Mix it with the powder, sell it to the masses.
Now you celebrate, muthafuckas raise your glasses
PUSH!!!
This is my time, this is my time
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign then it's my shower
This pole position, I made a lane because they blocked ours
Dope boys, block bleeders, gold diggers don't stop either
The motivation is wrong, if it hits the mark, it is not necessary.
Carry on like a carry-on, next to me, bitch, let me join you
Call me "daddy" of a complex
Because his mother's motherfucker wouldn't marry mom
And I speak Spanish like Don Omar
But I'm King Push, this king push
I rap, nigga, over niggas cheating, I don't sing hooks
Fuck nigga with the cunning talk
Miss me with all the talk
When they turn you on and the letters are there
You point us as an eye chart
But it's my fault, my sidewalk details
For 11 years, we saw better years
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than Billboard
I have a etiquette deal under my mattress
Cause I'm King Push, still King Push
Vultures to my culture
Exploit the fight, insult you
They name falling on Caine copping
Let's take another look, just a little closer
Anger against the machine, black Zack de la Rocha
On a cranberry rossta, inside the track on rap poster G
Better D-boy, all I'm missing is a script
Difference between me and Hova
But I'm King Push, still King Push
Malice found religion, Tony found prison
I'm just trying to find my way out of this damn kitchen
A Birdseye view made me channel my vision
Turn one by two now the kilo has a brother
We raise dust like the floors of the Colosseum
Walls full of safes like mausoleum doors
Pussy getting wet like her walking through my morgue
Yes, the fear of God is in your motherfuckers
This art imitates my life
Your WorldStarHipHop fame based on imitation white
Every penny made in your life more disastrous
While my old bitch went back to find her Masters
The same graduation, I was clapping on the rafters
What goes around comes around, this is the wheel of life
Hold and reverse the steering wheel while parking parallel
Grilled Kentucky Derby
The fact that I'm free lets me know that God is great
Ten year marathon of me selling concentrate
These rappers speak crowns but I'd rather speak of fear
Villain as Candyman, say my name and I'll appear
Hakuna kills, feet up, drinking java
Hey me, walking around the totem pole, what's my only problem?
Scrolling through my Rolodex, who will sleep with my child?
So many hands raised as the band plays
I'm here now, see how many niggas plans change
And finally answer the fall call
He got caught with 30 rocks, the cop looks like Alec Baldwin
Inter-century anthems based on tantrums in the city center
Based on the way we were marked
And at the airport they check all my luggage
But we keep on winning, this week has been a bad massage
I need a happy ending and a new beginning
And new equipment and some lucrative job opportunities
This is the real world, buddy, school over
They've stolen your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat money like the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied until all my niggas understand, do you understand?
And that American Apparel girl in stockings
He told the principal that he was trying to enter a school.
It's been a while since I saw the tube
Because as a cripple he said: "I have too many blues for more bad news"
I was looking at my resume feeling really fresh today
They rewrite the story I don't believe in yesterday
My boy said he needed a different approach
Because people look at me like I'm smelling coke
Tell them to hug and kiss my butt, X and O
Kiss the ring while they do it, do my thing while I have it
Play strings for the dramatic
And end all that shit
Act like you haven't had a belt in two classes
I don't have it, I'm going after whoever has it
You're exploding that's good fantastic
I don't really care about anything
Because the same people who tried to trick me
I let you enter my diary to admire me
The drug dealer dichotomy
I'm drawn to both sides, I'm Siamese
The push and pull opens the door, entrance
Destroy me and see what's inside this piñata
And rolling kilos in Gymstrada, that's a saga
A chapter of black magic, I am Harry Potter
I feel like I'm doomed to deal with women who
Relationships with their parents will not allow us to flourish
And flower, I swear this Vegas night was amazing
Losing some niggas, other niggas betrayed them
Fight with work, we were like the four horsemen.
Rick Flair with the flame, I'm muthaf * cking gorgeous, woah
When the gull-wing doors are raised, Karate Kid, crane kick, not Jaden Smith
Whiter than that coca cola brush they painted me
Sunken leather seats softer than a kiss of angels
But they are red as the devil, the tires have double tread
Postin parks, that gives me a double head
Walking the tightrope, try to keep your head level
The bright blind lights, look what the devil did
Yuugh!
This is my pain, this is my name, this is my power
If it's my reign then it's my shower
Dope boys, block bleeders
Gold diggers don't stop either
Motivation is wrong if it hits the mark, then it is not necessary.
Carry on like a carry-on, and my side bitch let it accompany me
Because his mother's motherfucker wouldn't marry mom
No excuses, no respect
Step on the brick like a walk
Twenty thousand in phone cards
And I speak Spanish like Don Omar, but
I'm King Push, this king push
I rap nigga over niggas cheating
I don't sing hooks
Fuck nigga, with the cunning talk
Miss me with all the talk
You point us, like an eye chart
We were selling birds at the port of time
My first grammy was my first brick
Red carpet, every bad bitch
More BMF than undercard
I have a label agreement under my mattress because
I'm King Push, I'm still King Push
I rap nigga over niggas cheating
I don't sing hooks
Vultures to my culture
Exploit the fight, insult you
But he has never been an infantryman
Let's take another look, just a little closer
On a cranberry rossta, inside the track on rap poster G
Better d-boy, all I'm missing is a script
Difference between Hova and me, but
I'm King Push, I'm still King Push
Boy you got six in the morning
You have that thing that will make a girl feel drugged
Oh I say boy, you got me alone
Just say the words, I'll do what you want
Boy let me love you
Uh, I know you think it's me, but who doesn't?
Comes with the territory when you buzz
A ball player sold you a dream, he does nothing
A couple of rappers under your belt, but who's judging?
I'm not trying to guide you, hand on the Bible
Naked thirty dollar catsuits aren't cute
And fifty comments in the ass are no coincidence
So no handcuffs, no buns in the oven
If my girl calls your phone, she's just bluffing
If anyone else asks, just nothing
Boy you got six in the morning
Oh I say boy, you got me alone
Boy let me love you
With Givenchy toppa, Balenciaga shoe
If you act well, I can match you well
If it's a dollar, great like Poppa
Put your exes in my choppa
You know she wants to be you in that vehicle
Mount on transparent V1, V2
Christians or Chloe, damn, they are also C
I know it's not cheap for you to lie here
Boy you got six in the morning
You have that thing that will make a girl feel drugged
Just say the words, I'll do what you want
Boy let me love you
You cannot commit crime without an accomplice.
We are both to blame, let's push the shame behind us
On the DL, pushing my brother's CL
See you at the place, you had a tint on the TL
It's okay to shake off the fake guys
It blows everything because the money doesn't last
They all broke niggas looking sad puppy
She in that new bag, saying, "Honey, don't ask."
Boy you got six in the morning
You have that thing that will make a girl feel drugged
Oh I say boy, you got me alone
Just say the words, I'll do what you want
Boy let me love you
People looked at me differently and they knew I was with someone. I no longer had to wait in line at the bakery on Sunday mornings to get fresh bread. The owner knew who he was with and he came from the counter. No matter how many people were waiting, they attended to me first. Our neighbors no longer park on our driveway, even though we didn't have a car. I mean, at 13, I was making more money than most adults in the neighborhood. I mean, I had more money than I could spend. I had it all!
I am in the forest
I'm on my mind
I'm building an alembic
To slow down time
I'm lost in the world
I'm down on my line
I'm new in the city
Down at night
I'm lost in the world
I'm new in the city
And I'm down at night
Down at night
Said she's down at night
I'm the real situation, I should be on Jersey Shore
We found a super monster, no she won't know what hit her
I'm on my Rick James minus the beads and the shine
You have to ask for forgiveness, this shit here is money talking
You don't have a good dick too often, I have fun walking you
Damn, too late you lost it, back to that world where you lost
Back to that world where you lost
I'm in the woods, I'm on my mind
(Run from the lights, run from the night)
I'm new to town, but I'm sad at night
(Run for your life, down at night)
I'm lost in the world, I've been depressed all my life
I'm new to town and I'm sad at night
Down at night
Down at night
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?
I'm new to town and I'm sad at night
Down at night
I'm lost in the world, I've been depressed all my life
I'm new to town and I'm sad at night
Down at night
Down at night
Yeah I take the black lunch money
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only fool that can be quoted
Mommy tries to land a Sinatra
So you don't screw blacks with Apple Watches
Yelling at the drug boy ignited sixteen swipers
Movie on my neck with screen gems
Me and my nigga having bottle wars
40 thousand on the floor when the bottles are poured (Spill, nigga)
A Blu Ray to your DVD
You may have caught me on TMZ
Cameo tries to sue a nigga (Fuck 'em)
Cause I party hard like it's three of me
America is still abusing us
And 9/11 is the Ku Klux
So why wouldn't I fire back?
It's true, I'm out of place
You better defend something ahead of time
If the crown isn't mine, tell me who's behind
Yeah I take the black lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only fool that can be quoted
Poppy bring me whatever you want
Riding with Miguel Cotto in the trunk
Mink, leather or lizard, black
The dummy for you ball players
Scream my monster Mac 11
I grew up on Nintendo playing Contra
And even though that black man is only 5'9 "
100 bodies on your timeline
I lost my bitch, I bought a chef
Hottest 7, I'm so alive
Your Swiss bank account, nigga, also mine
If the crown isn't mine, tell me who's behind
Yeah I take the black lunch money
Too bad, I was fucking hungry
Real niggas don't notice you
I'm the only fool that can be quoted
The lyrics of this song have not yet been released. Check back once the song has been released.
Creep on these niggas
Talk about these niggas
Talk about a nigga
Walk on that bitch and say hi
Walk on that bitch and say hi
Go and make it hit, go and make it hit
Get followed by them gaps, go and have them hit
Niggas ain't been to church in a minute
But it's funny how that TEC makes a black man become religious
Amen!
Play your part, it's easy to act like Mitch
Paid in full is just being Rich Porter
Fill all standing orders
Would you ask if I could swim if you saw me walking on water?
Yes, while every song has a rapper dance
Yuugh, I'm drug money like Dapper Dan
No retirement plans, no Derek Jeters
We all know I did it; Rodriguez
The illusion of money that we don't believe in
I'm Kim Jong from the crack song
‘Because we already saw everything and they tell lies
Creep on these niggas
Creep on these niggas
Talk about these niggas
Talk about a nigga
Walk on that bitch and say hi
Walk on that bitch and say hi
Go and make it hit, go and make it hit
Get followed by them gaps, go and have them hit
Niggas ain't been to church in a minute
But it's funny how that TEC makes a black man become religious
Amen!
You'd rather be more famous than rich
Play your part, it's easy to be my bitch
It's fair for a queen to floss your shit
Minima, niggas ain't synonyms
Double exhaust, driving flying saucers
And laugh at the fucking promoter whores
Waiting for them to show, they still drive a Focus
Why the fuck if you didn't know what the goal was?
Brightness, remote control blinds
That turns on the time lapse, controlled by the iPad
Ahhh, my living room rap scream crack money
I don't trust rap niggas or rap money
Creep on these niggas
Creep on these niggas
Talk about these niggas
Talk about a nigga
Walk on that bitch and say hi
Walk on that bitch and say hi
Go and make it hit, go and make it hit
Get followed by them gaps, go and have them hit
Niggas ain't been to church in a minute
But it's funny how that TEC makes a black man become religious
Amen!
Niggas speaks it, but he's not living it
They ask me why I keep talking about drugs, why not?
The biggest rappers in the game broke, voilà
They say it's hate, but are these snakes well dressed
Let them learn to walk on concrete, I just saw him and spoke to him
Yuugh, you don't know, they trained you
Jaaa, all the time I sold coke through it
Nigga, and record that I was Bo through him
King Push stands for kingpin
Uh, this is O Dog in the yard
You wonder why I'm still here
I am America's worst nightmare
Night, black night
Creep on these niggas
Creep on these niggas
Talk about a nigga
Walk on that bitch and say hi
Walk on that bitch and say hi
Go and make it hit, go and make it hit
Get followed by them gaps, go and have them hit
Niggas ain't been to church in a minute
But it's funny how that TEC makes a black man become religious
Amen!
You already know what happens when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG come together, right?
We get that money
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
This shit everyone wanted
This shit is cooked hard, right?
Everyone has to apologize for that.
But this shit sounds like God doesn't it?
Yuugh, I'm tired, nigga
And you all have to pay your tithes, nigga
Call my ghost the holy ghost
Church on chrome wheels, nigga
Pop tags when I'm paranoid
Because the pawn shop was my paradise
For that knot kept in that shoe box
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
And these black diamonds like Boondocks
I restore the feeling of when niggas did a kill
And hoes with angel faces, crying with evil intent
Just to be able to buy them Christians
Make them shit on all those bitches ah!
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Horrible result, a drugged boy has a reason
Cry when you condemn him, cry at every visit
I'm crying saying your name, ride on all my niggas
I used to touch my finger until I found a fortune
Finger fucking a Ferrari, south of France early in the morning
Preferred soft moccasin, frost, organic grass.
Stay away from the Forbes, if only I could tell you more
I have a kilo by 20, my choppas say I'm the shit
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
This shit that you ask for
Mash the nigga on the gas, floor
Two doors, four doors
Roll around the hood as a task force
Fast forward: oops! They say they want to see evidence
My record sales are not as much as theirs
And we keep riding the same coupes
Why do we keep buying the same clothes?
How we both got the same watch
I just keep you all on alert
Dope boys, gold mine
That fall in prices and that increase in coca
Then put it on that blue flame
I restore the feeling of when niggas did a kill
Hidden 'choppas in the closet, half a million on the roof
I have the knife on the counter, Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet on the christians and keep fucking all the bitches
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Million-million on the ceiling, million-million on the ceiling
Choppas-choppas in the closet, choppas-choppas in the closet
This shit you want, this shit sounds like God, right?
This shit you want, this shit sounds like God, right?
This shit you want, this shit sounds like God, right?
This shit you want, this shit sounds like God, right?
You know what happens when G. O. O. D. Music and mmg get together right?
We get that money
Millions, millions on the roof
Millions, millions on the roof
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
Choppers, choppers in the closet
That shit you want?
Everyone has to ask for forgiveness
But this shit sounds like God doesn't it? (yes)
I'm tired and everyone has to pay for their ties
Church on chrome wheels
Because a pawn shop was my paradise
I was there when that dust appeared
Why it's not safe in that shoe box
Blue tops, blue tops, bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face and blue rays and these black diamonds like boondocks
I restore the feeling of when niggas did a kill
Hiding half a million helicopters in the closet on the ceiling
And those niggas with angel faces crying with intent
And just to be able to buy them, Christians have to fuck all their bitches, ah!
Horror stories honor me, I want to be homeowners
The horrible result with the child has a reason
Prize when in conflict, pride on every visit
I'm crying saying your name, ride on all my niggas
Fucking finger in Ferrari, south of France early in the morning
Get drunk with Donatello, Versace, my Acapella
Never see me in Neimans, nigga committing treason
Preferred soft moccasin, icy organic grass
Stay away from the ways our unique can tell you more
I have this, I have that
I have that, I have this
I have a kilo by twenty
My niggas say I'm the shit
This shit you'll ask for
Make a nigga on the gas floor
2 doors, 4 doors, roll through the hood as a special force
My sales record is not much like theirs and we still ride the same coupes
How do we keep fucking the same hoe?
How do we keep buying the same clothes?
How did we both get the same watch?
I just keep you alert
That fall in prices and that increase in Coca-Cola
I restore the feeling of when niggas did a kill
Hiding half a million helicopters in the closet on the ceiling
I have the razor on the Arm-N-Hammer counter in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet on the Christians and keep fucking all your bitches up, aaah!
You already know what happens when G.O.O.D. Music and MMG come together, right?
We get that money
Million-million on the roof
Million-million on the roof
Million-million on the roof
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
Choppas-choppas in the closet
This shit everyone wanted
This shit is cooked hard, right?
Everyone has to apologize for that.
But this shit sounds like God doesn't it?
Call my ghost the holy ghost, church on chrome wheel rims, black
Pop tags when I'm paranoid, because the pawn shop was my paradise
I was dead when that dust came from that knot stored in that shoe box
I restore the feeling of when niggas did a kill
Hidden 'choppas in the closet, half a million on the roof
And hoes with angel faces, crying with evil intent
Just to be able to buy them Christians, make them fuck with all those bitches, ah!
I'm haunted by horror stories, I want to be homeowners
Horrible result, a drugged boy has a reason
Cry when you condemn him, cry at every visit
I used to touch my finger until I found a fortune
Finger fucking a Ferrari, south of France early in the morning
Drugs with Donatella, Versace mi a cappella
Stay away from the Forbes, if only I could tell you more
I have this, I have that, I have I have this
I have a kilo by 20, my choppas say I'm the shit
This shit that you ask for
Mash the nigga on the gas, floor
Two doors, four doors, roll through the hood as a task force
Fast forward: oops! They say they want to see evidence
My sales record is not much like theirs and we still ride the same coupes
How we keep fucking the same hoes, why we keep buying the same clothes
Since we both got the same watch, I just keep everyone on alert
Dope boys, gold mine, that fall in prices and that increase in coca
Then put it on that blue flame and then hang it dry like a clothesline
I restore the feeling of when niggas did a kill
Hidden 'choppas in the closet, half a million on the roof
I have the knife on the counter, Arm & Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet on the christians and keep fucking all the bitches
This shit that you want
This shit sounds like God, doesn't it?
They thought he was lying dead, he was playing possum
Look at me everywhere with all 8 like Kate Goslin
Now they hide their head like an ostrich
Optimus Prime and that gull-wing feeling like I'm transformed
Niggas still holding hands, whip like a sandstorm
I had the audacity to sell it in a damn poem
Get taller Angelo, the author of these hymns
Like the clear glass of that coupe, I pass
Money on my mind like my pillow is a vault
You niggas are soft, so that pillow is where they talk
I can't find it on d-list actresses on mattresses
Your real chance to love you singles, I laugh at them
Bitches love money, I grant them three wishes, Push
You don't even know you have an aka, do you?
Always in that shit, Mike Dean, what's up? Brendan
Or should I say Brendan International? Marcus Paul? Update, yes
Fear of the gods in these motherfuckers
Niggas ain't fucking with me man no games yeah
MMM
I got some killers, so don't push me, Juicy J's in a mob shit
Waiting at your door, hiding in the bushes (Mhmm)
I have a vest, I have a weapon that can really do it (Mhmm)
You niggas playing for real niggas money, face it
One day you are the plug, the next day you are in the garbage can
Give your ass that body work, nigga, we spray (spray)
This is not an arcade, nigga, so stop playing (stop playing)
It's time to eat, my niggas and me buffing
Give your ass that body work, nigga, we spray (we spray)
You don't know about this life, nigga
Winning all these stripes, nigga
Kilograms, Peter pans, bike rack, nigga
Throwing bitches on flights, nigga
They don't know what to do, nigga
'Till the money runs out and the bottle is spilling'
Rose gold on my wrist, this Rolex like devil's piss
This Daytona lights up, you think I'm talking about that devil shit
These fifty racks, no bevel shit
This mo 'guns, this mo' bodies
We call shots, they are not bodies
They fuck blacks, they owe it prolifically
Who fucks with me? No one
When they pulled out the guns, they really regret
Cannonballs make your body move
Fuck with my money and I'll hit you with that body work
Ridin 'with three K's and I'm not talking about the Klan (No Klan)
This is not an arcade, nigga, so stop playing (stop playing)
It's time to eat, my niggas and me buffing
Give your ass that body work, nigga, we spray (we spray)
Ridin 'with three K's and I'm not talking about the Klan (No Klan)
This is not an arcade, nigga, so stop playing (Play, nigga)
Bad bitches on deck, nigga
Money, power, respect, black
All be rap dissin '
I catch niggas, I check niggas
These thugs with me don't spit verses
Black 'maro 2 S, black
Pair of birds on my neck, black
Every time the hoes see me
They like, "Meek Milly, you're a mess, nigga"
Two gats, without vest, black
This golden Rollie that's on my wrist
Leprechaun prolly die for
Young boys who are in my strip
I'll kill everything I say, ride!
T-tell them niggas call us if they don't have a job
Because we lift weights but we don't do body work
Give your ass that body work, nigga, we spray (spray)
Ridin 'with three K's and I'm not talking about the Klan (No Klan)
It's time to eat, my niggas and me buffing
Give your ass that body work, nigga, we spray (we spray)
Ridin 'with three K's and I'm not talking about the Klan (No Klan)
This is not an arcade, nigga, so stop playing (Play, nigga)
You know we love that KK sound, you know we don't back down
Hunnid drum as "Hold that doe", though diamonds sparkle like Kodak
Cash, nigga, fuck that loan, seven digits on that phone
Money so long, smoke a whole area
Getting blood money, try to get me my cousin
Bitch I'm on fire I got my jaw hooked
Sex, money, murder, Petey Rollack (Soundview, whaddup)
Bodywork, chopper works like a techno song
Twenty thousand shows, I just hope my nigga Max comes home (wavey)
Quick money, diamonds flash like high beams
Make it rain on this bitch, Hurricane Irene
Give your ass that body work, nigga, we spray (spray)
Ridin 'with three K's and I'm not talking about the Klan (No Klan)
This is not an arcade, nigga, so stop playing (stop playing)
It's time to eat, my niggas and me buffing
Ridin 'with three K's and I'm not talking about the Klan (No Klan)
This is not an arcade, nigga, so stop playing (Play, nigga)
It's time to eat, my niggas and me buffing (we won)
I see the strangest things
The evil that money brings
That goes round and round and round like sirens
And they want to bury me
Why? Because I am against everything
I swear it's like a disease
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not quite
Get in the drawers
I had a dream, I had it all
The top three killers of you niggas
It's the shit that draws you the most niggas
Lies will help you get through it
Money, pussy, alcohol, what a wonderful cocktail.
I faced my first brick on tails and ran with it
Dope is like a two-way street
Every shine in the club that wasn't ours, we compete
Poor minds, poor decision makers
Without reward, what is the risk that you run?
I won't reveal it yet, I can't say it yet
Defense Win Games Bill Belichick
These hoes have google numbers, niggas better check
Yuugh
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
Get in the drawers
I had a dream, I had it all
I woke up and I really had it all
Scream my bitches fucking baseball niggas
That dress like Bamas with guaranteed contracts
Now the big leagues are fishing
You are young and hot, why not?
The dealership is laundered, the money's dry, so take your best shot
We really made you look from afar
He even spoke badly to you, try to dim your star
And see how they pick you up
And then we realized that we lost a diamond in the rough
So make us proud, make it count
Until you learn to love them, make them save nothing
Take advantage when you are worth it
Money, pussy, alcohol
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy not quite
Get in the drawers
Lose your mind go crazy
I have money, you also have money
You think it's honey dew
Whispering in my ear like a crow
Looking at every bottle we go through
Tryin 'to be close, nigga damn close
They are not photos, now you are in your feelings
I'm a real drug boy, I don't treat strange
Bruised Ego, Henny-induced Debos
Nickel bag niggas, suddenly Ninos
I cancel all G-Moneys for G money
Money, pussy, alcohol
You niggas pussy after all
Money, pussy, alcohol
Get in the drawers
I had a dream, I had it all
Look at the future as car show floor models
Both feet in the snow, for my core to go on
Drown sorrows, blue ocean bats
The formula warns you
Crack kills offerings to coroner
Kill my older brother? Nigga, I'll be damned
A swindler's paradise, a pair of lucky dice
Because the dough I add had a coca base
There's no feeling your bitch is getting cold right
You are in Italian leather and you have four wheels on the right
You know you're awake when you count a quarter of a thousand blank
And if you fall, you can say it like a pillow fight
I'm a magician, nigga here's the magic
Make a small town feel like a snow storm is throwing at it
Get the green of the scale like a lizard
Witness when I unveil this instant classic
Yes! OMG!
The first one is still here, so I'll need a hearse
I have a voodoo doll every time I write a verse
They not only say they are sorry, but they say it hurts
No pain, no gain, black
I only change when the new body came, nigga
Aerodynamics, panoramic roof.
My credit score allowed the dealer to make the most of
Paid over the price tag, cash on hand
012 a year earlier, I'm a time bandit
I have to manage the time when you lift snow
They won't be waiting, I have no patience
This is the end of all my unrecognized greatness
I'm here now, nigga, forgive my delay
It is the new flow of God, is it not?
Take a position on the chessboard and rearrange it
Face to face with the truth, get acquainted
Without flexible zone, without flexible zone
Without flexible zone, without flexible zone
They know better, they know better
I treat it so special
They are tens or better
I am a fashion pioneer
I'm a hustler
Who is not waiting for King Push?
I got niggas looking for new flows
Sold more dope than old Jigga
Now niggas call me the new Hov
Let go of the coupe, planetarium
Let the ceiling go like a cesarean
Just some hunnid bottles they carry
This black foreigner, he doesn't know better
I lose the plane in this black fool
I bought drugs with the budget of my album
Play Cloths was the model
Four million in four seasons
Fuck who cares about my fashion sense
Tell a ho to come and swim in the money (splash)
Broke niggas just stop on the heel
I could paint your body with those marks
And put a red bow on the wheels
See I'm coming and going, I call a rent by mouth
Sucks ice off a bezel
Use my rap character, fuck baby moms
If I am the problem
So you can't solve it
You live in the crosshairs
When you are the target
It's hard to stay underground
From sun to sunset
I'm shining independently
We came with the mission
To take it, you must be ruthless
One of the most difficult, ah
I'm the most real alive, you don't want no problem
Shoot you down, there ain't gonna be no problem yugh
I have the feeling that I'm drugged
In my life you will not want these problems
Shooting down is not going to be a problem
Look when you play with God
I have diamonds dancing in my mouth
I believe you the king of this house, I come for you
I'm the most real alive, you don't want no problem
Shoot you down, there ain't gonna be no problem yugh
Dead or alive, I am wanted
Like a ghost I'm haunted
The angel of death is upon us.
It is not a threat, it is a promise.
Kill at will if we are honest
I'm telling you, don't lie, it's Jekyll and Hyde
When you're like one with the monsters
I am the problem (yugh)
I have the power (yugh)
I have the pull, I run with the bulls
You run with the cowards
I turned off the beat, your funeral is on
I present myself with flowers
I'm the most real alive, you don't want no problem
Shoot you down, there ain't gonna be no problem yugh
I have the feeling that I'm drugged
In my life you will not want these problems
Shooting down is not going to be a problem
I have the Tec and the team that comes for you
I have diamonds dancing in my mouth
I believe you the king of this house, I come for you
I'm the most real alive, you don't want no problem
Shoot you down, there ain't gonna be no problem yugh
Yeah i'm on the move i can't look back (no way)
Screaming: "No regrets, no regrets"
Lost time, I can't make up for that
Real nigga and all my real niggas niggas
It came from making real figures (too much money)
Nothing less, I do not regret (come on)
Say hello to the bad guy, say ahhh to champagne
(Woo!) Come on I'm doing my damn thing
Magazines, videos, nothing is missing.
Nowadays I sell hope, what do you prefer that I sell drugs?
What I sell is a lifestyle, naked bitches on sailboats
Rent-a-cars we run on the road, money longer than the train smoke
Representing my niggas until they are released as Django
It's the same as always, the same as always
How's the game going, where's the pain, where's the blame?
My mind wanders in a PC, my mom grew up in the PC
If I leave today, throw away the keys
But I'm going to live today, I want to see tomorrow, I want to lead the way
Lost time, I can't make up for that
Uh, so every day I go hard
It came from making real figures (too much money)
Nothing less, I do not regret (come on)
No, no, I don't regret it, ahhh ...
Mama had me in the ghetto, I grew up in the slums
All heroes have theme music, I guess I need some drums
I bought myself a 5 for 50, I shot them down, they were jumps
The streets taught us, the streets raised us, they had it less determined
Dodging jackers, dodging murders, federal to state pen
Uncle has power, now I see it in ten others
We were created just to lose, God knows we're trying to win
In pursuit of this power, this masterpiece at the time
You know it's platinum and waterproof, wear this bitch in the shower
In the hood, I'm a king, King Arthur to the people
Except he got his in a car, I got mine in a Regal
Sports cars, Italian leather, princess cut with baguettes
The law of physics says that the 9 weigh more when they get wet
No regrets
Screaming: "No regrets, no regrets"
Lost time, I can't make up for that
Uh, so every day I go hard
Real nigga and all my real niggas niggas
It came from making real figures (too much money)
Nothing less, I do not regret (come on)
No, no, I don't regret it, ahhh ...
Presidential, I'm back, April showers, it's raining again
I jumped forward like something from June, I'm still driving that Maybach
Time ahead, my braids back, Tom Ford and my black shadows
Dope boy with a cape on, oversizing that beige back
All white as Gotti said, you told me I'm leaving here
I mentioned Ye two years ago, yeah, I got it from the square (Woo!)
And you could buy a pair, twenty or more and we'll take them there
How are you acting like I'm not here? D-Boy and I pioneers
Yeah i'm on the move i can't look back (no way)
Screaming: "No regrets, no regrets"
Lost time, I can't make up for that
Uh, so every day I go hard
Real nigga and all my real niggas niggas
Nothing less, I do not regret (come on)
No, no, I don't regret it, ahhh ...
W-W-W-What is it?
More than twenty years selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder there is diaper rash on my consciousness
Arm & Hammer and Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then break the kitchen window, let it air out
Because I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, boot jacket that was two-tone
Four lockers, four different bitches put their mule
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and an arm full of watches
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, "If he dies, he dies"
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwing punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink the pain when a black man dies
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a black name on your meat
We play in a superior chess game
One million megapixel Pyrex
I started on the scale, digital, my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, just because it's honest
Pure as the fumes that are fucking with my bosom
Blood on your diamonds until you die, dead!
"You better change what comes out of your speaker"
"Dee-dee-dee, dah-dee, dah-dee, dee-dee, dah-dee, day-ah" (What is it?)
Do you want to see a corpse?
Instrumentals for my mom's christmas party
The problems are on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother crying
Smokers repeatedly buy my Sega Genesis
Either that or my aunt was stealing it
Hit the pipe and start feeling it
Ooh, cry, cut me a little, the grass never did that
This was different, gee, Louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world it was in
When I was ten, when nine ounces were ten
And nine times out of ten, blacks don't pay attention
And when there's tension in the air, the nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter piece into four and a half
Took an L, started selling demons of bubble bath soap
He broke his nails, misusing his little finger to treat his nose
Buttoned shirt, taco meat on his gold
I said, "Dad, one day, I'm going to hit you with thirty-six zippers
Now you can rock it or sell it smooth like leather interior
Drop some ice cubes, Deebo on the perimeter "
He said "well nigga then show me how it all makes sense"
Imagine, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your silly son, black!
Now reap what you sow, black! (Please reap what you sow, nigga)
Now the same shit they were smoking is my profession
Let's get it
"You better change what comes out of your speaker"
"Better change ch-change, ch-change, ch-change, cha-ange"
"You better change what comes out of your speaker"
"Th-Th-Th-Th-Must be on whose cock?"
(Yes!) How do you feel?
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
It's a different jingle when you hear these car keys
Your SL is losing an S, nigga
Your plane misses a chef
The common theme, look, they both have wings
If you fly, do it to death
It's just a God, and it's just a crown
So only a king can stand on this mound
The Coast Guard is coming a hundred going overboard
I have money with the best of them
Go blow for blow with any Mexican
Don't let your bitches settle
I might have to hit your Evelyn
I could go back and relapse to finish this crude
Givenchy fits like gym clothes
We really are gymnasts, I'm like D. Rose
No D-League, I'm this close
'88 Jordan, jumping from the free kick
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
Motherfuckers can't rhyme anymore, about crime no more
25 bricks, move work as homework
Hit Delaware twice, I needed 25 more
Come and meet the man standing, a duty that I flaunt
The legend grows legs when it comes back to haunt us
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
I can't a bitch living saying I bought her Michael Kors
Keep the sticker on the window, if you wonder how much it costs
How could you relate when you have never been great?
And trust rap money to keep food on your plates, nigga?
I could sell a brick on my birthday
36 years of making land as if it were Earth Day, God
Ballers, I put numbers on the boards
It is clear that I realized
I can't imagine it being like that, so jealous
Only you can say it, tell me why
Only you can say it, only you can say it
Only you can say it
Only you can say
Only you can say it
Two sides, which will make the game
Stacking mine, nigga ye high
I couldn't imagine a better view
From the pool house you see four cars
Bad bitches, they're skinny
Mixed College Bitches With Pornstars
I disconnected my OnStar, not GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, turned eyepiece, that's CBS
Dirty hands like Ason, I'm pounding you nigga J Kwon
Bloggers follow your trail, 500 horses run
Coca-Cola ties, that Coca-Cola dries, cements, bakes
Eghck! That is based on the life of a black man who says nothing
Tight trunk, white trunk, can't relate if you don't bleed anything
You're asking me to tell you why you niggas never had a thing
Folarin back, the hardest thing we put on the map
We are not hating it, because we are not, too much Ciroc that CB4
62, black on black, see my vehicle is like the MEAC ball
I scream at Norfolk, kick from Portland, my hoes from Portsmouth
All notch and dime, if a brick were round you might need a forklift
I can't fuck with us cause me and my niggas travel
That's right, what's up Pusha T, it's DMV for life
Giuseppe Zanotti, sorry, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Tell these motherfuckers to catch me
Iceberg Shorty, fuck up your Disney store
Behind these walls, still in our thoughts, the city knows
It is a different face that you are showing
It's another "welcome back"
Only you can say it, tell me why
Only you can say it, only you can say it
Only you can say it
Tell me why
It is clear that I realized
It is a different face that you are showing
It's another "welcome back"
Only you can say it, tell me why
Only you can say it, only you can say it
Only you can say it
Only you can say
Only you can say it
Tell me why
Two sides, which will make the game
Stacking mine, nigga ye high
I couldn't imagine a better view
From the pool house you see four cars
Bad bitches, they're skinny
Mixed College Bitches With Pornstars
I disconnected my OnStar, not GPS these VVS
Lorraine Schwartz on speed dial, one eyepiece, that's CBS
Aston Martin, DBS, James Bond great as James Todd
The best black to hit and run from A-Rod
Dirty hands like Ason, I'm pounding you nigga J Kwon
My Diors is distraught, CDG vest with Jays in
Eghck! That is based on the life of a black man who says nothing
Tight trunk, white trunk, can't relate if you don't bleed anything
Now that he's said something, don't make me have to die anything
You're asking me to tell you why you niggas never had a thing
It is clear that I realized
It is a different face that you are showing
It's another "welcome back"
I can't imagine it being like that, so jealous
Only you can say it, tell me why
Only you can say it, only you can say it
Only you can say it
Only you can say
Only you can say it
Tell me why
Folarin back, the hardest thing we put on the map
My eyes down, I keep 5 rolled for my THC to produce sound effects
We are not hating it, because we are not, too much Ciroc that CB4
62, black on black, see my vehicle is like the MEAC ball
I scream at Norfolk, kick from Portland, my hoes from Portsmouth
All notch and dime, if a brick were round you might need a forklift
I can't fuck with us cause me and my niggas travel
Giuseppe Zanotti, sorry, respiratory full of Nesta Marley
Three something for an after party and Balenciaga, I filled Arenas twice
Tell these motherfuckers to catch me
Iceberg Shorty, fuck up your Disney store
And delete your words, G double O-D, MMG we're fine
I have Zamunda skins, I don't know how Akeem, but Pusha is semi cold
My nigga Geezy in VA, I hope you hear these streams
Behind these walls, still in our thoughts, the city knows
It is clear that I realized
It's another "welcome back"
I can't imagine it being like that, so jealous
Only you can say it, only you can say it
Only you can say it
Only you can say it
Tell me why
Promises flow for slow sips
And if you're chasing your role, I'll roll with you
On an onion, smell a bag of Funyuns
Bitches pack dozens, fuck 'em until they malfunction
I laugh with laughter, taking photos like a gunman
I don't hunt game, motherfucker, I hunt men
Take them to the back of my truck to rot
Kill a damn superhero, I watch the Watchmen
My Glock that is armed, loaded and ready to lock
Who's sending niggas down to earth? Ostriches
Captain holding them captive hostages
Create butchers from cartridges, eating the pigs' hearts
To murder, murder is a part of living with it
Take your Teflon, ammunition and your gat
Unless you want to be screwed as a porn scat
Oooh, you're not saying anything
Guns drawn, niggas scream opera
38 snub or helicopter
You better hope the Lord is your doctor
Like, oooh, you're not saying anything
Guns drawn, niggas scream, opera
38 snub or helicopter
The middle finger goes to the coppers
You better hope the Lord is your doctor
Like, oooh
Hey Hodgy, hey Tyler, don't worry about us
(We killed them all, 50 shots, fuck kindness
In all black Versace dressed in the best)
We sell everything, even drugs are designers
Gangsta bitches, red jumpsuits for ecstasy
(Fuck it, take them all, overdose the recipe
Let the hoes show their true colors-) crew lovers
I passed like a cold (It's a zoo of us)
Two brothers, add two others just the news
Make the net go down, the last "Who did it?"
(And who knew Sarah Palin with the hit-and-run sniffing daughter?
But she was taking down Glen Rice)
It was nice since Wolf Gang was cubs
(Golf Wang adult, now they go crazy)
Add two drug boys known for taping
(Kick in the door, now the world is not safe enough)
Oooh, you're not saying anything
Guns drawn, niggas scream opera
38 snub or helicopter
You better hope the Lord is your doctor
Like, oooh, you're not saying anything
Guns drawn, niggas scream, opera
38 snub or helicopter
The middle finger goes to the coppers
You better hope the Lord is your doctor
Saliva bars, this tough, teen sixteen bars
I'm fucking up the game when her vagina has scars on my cock
Um, sure it is ‘Preme button up floral
Lots of money, dark shadows, like a damn tourist
Or are the Tourettes with my damn neck
I'm like an average black in the 20's from 18
And I'm not even 20 years old, I lost a classic at 18
Wolves finally reconcile
As she mouths, this shit is sick and fucking vile
Trying to screw my destiny, they couldn't find another child
Snippet lyrics
If my girl called your phone, she just bluffed
If anyone else asks, just nothing
Boy you got six in the morning
"OR-"
"Open your eyes, look at the sky and look
I'm just a poor ...
I'm just a poor boy ... "
"Open your eyes, look at the sky and look
I'm just a poor boy ... "
Seeing is believing, believing when you see it
They tied me to a mountain, I just try to ski
Long distance wireless kinect like I Wii it
Double-U double-I, spelled so you can see it
Because it's way over their heads when Ray Allen 3
I'm Rondo on the bongos when I give you my convo
We haven't been home since the Congo was taken from us
Toast to progress while I'm looking at my condo
I got this far and I've never been a fool
Yuh, while you compare me to a fucking newbie
You can't respect the new school when you play hookie
Cooked White, Tan, Sold Worldwide Snooki
School of Hard Knocks, look where the game took me
To the limit like Montana with better grammar
Bigger houses with bigger guns and better cameras
"Open your eyes, look at the sky and look
I'm just a poor boy ... "
Now you are listening to the future.
Open your eyes, nigga, and see what I see
Don't worry about me, I'm just here to restore the feeling
Yeah i'm just here to restore the feeling
Feel the pressure yeah
I never threw a penny in a wishing well (never)
I put it all on a fishing scale (Yes)
And an apron hanging from a kitchen nail
Straight from my memories as I kiss and count
Big faces like Rushmore, they touch more
Fashion pioneers, trendsetters look for us
The next mission when the tide runs dry
Fifteen years kidnapping spies like us
Jail doesn't resonate with guys like us
I told Wesley at the Oscars to slide like us
I didn't listen, so prison is what they did to him
Undamaged accountant, millions is what they hid through it
"Open your eyes, look at the sky and look
I'm just a poor boy ... "
The odds are against us
However, there are no excuses, we just play harder
Hurry smarter yeah
Congratulations my nigga
Now let go TIP, yuh
Yes Yes Yes
I never feel pain
Because I did, I felt too much pain
Money going in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
Getting money, girl, gold chains
I never feel pain
Blood flowing through my veins
Getting money, swinging chains
We will never feel the same
We thugs in the game
I never feel pain
Eighteen wheeled gorillas
Black with gold chains, launch bird like Steelers
Hines Ward of the crime lords
Running through this money, yelling, "Encore!"
Spending nights with a prostitute
Celebrating on a whim, nigga
Pain is Pac, Above the Rim, nigga
My bitch rocks a bigger gem, niggas
Because she was there when it was dark, black
She wasn't fucking any of them niggas
So now we're like a hem, nigga
Put your freedom on failure
Tryna find my Griselda (The Godmother!)
I could also nail you
Mom screaming like Mahalia
Pain is love and it is war
The pain is running out
The pain is discovering that you are poor
While the feds knock on your door
Because I did, I felt too much pain
I've been around here, standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I never feel pain
Because I did, I felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, swinging all these gold chains
Millions of dollars in a gold ring.
Pain is joy when he cries
It's my smile in disguise
It's what makes the story creepy
Forgive women and children.
Listen to the villain's doodles
Pyrex on the tray like hot sex
Pain in this bitch, with a mask and a glove.
No risk without profit
Not trust without shame
It's not us without 'Caine
Push: my name is my name
In the kitchen with a cape on, apron
Trey eight and up, it could have been Trayvon
Dust face like a geisha
Arm & Hammer for breakup
Turn one into two, look at the brick kiss and makeup (wow!)
It's a match made in heaven
All that is missing is the reverend
All that is missing is a blessing.
I hope God receives the message
I've been around here, standing in the rain
Blood flowing through my veins
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, rock a hundred gold chains
I never feel pain
Because I did, I felt too much pain
I'm just standing in the rain
I'm just doing my thing
Getting money, swinging all these gold chains
Millions of dollars in a gold ring.
Since we're on the subject, let me be nasty
This is not a style war, here is Shottas
I just paid that ransom, stunting your biatches
We, buyers, bloggers, if money talks, gossip
You try it on, then you take it off, then you post a photo on your Tumblrs
We flip that, take a somersault, get it back because we're scammers
It's heating up, we shoot like Waco
They make the order, we cross the border with pesos
Do you want to make cakes? If I want to make cakes
Let me see it in your eyes, I want to make cakes
Then try this exercise
Do you want to make, do you want to make, do you want to make cakes?
Do you want to do, do you want to do, do you want to make cakes, cakes
Do you want to make, do you want to make, do you want to make cakes?
If I want to do
Pyrex baking trays, watch break-dance birds
I measured it perfect, the product is in good hands (WOO)
You want the loot, cook it up to the oils
A pair of diamonds keep you loyal bitch
Roger Federer Rolex, my real doll. (Yes)
Goyard luggage trunks, nigga
Tell the buttons in the square not to throw it away, black (Wooh)
Oh it's just luxury when you don't have it (Wooh)
Take a look at the BabyGinny wardrobe
All sponsored cocaine, the Nextel screech era made monsters
Do you want to do, do you want to do, do you want to make cakes, cakes?
Do you want to make, do you want to make, do you want to make cakes?
If I want to do
Do you want to do, do you want to do, do you want to make cakes, cakes?
Do you want to make, do you want to make, do you want to make cakes?
If I want to do
My hands are tied, the power is above me
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just a puppet here
Family, fortune, envy, jealousy.
Privilege, past legacy
Secret, sabotage, serious crime
Suicide, subtraction, selfish, pedigree
When love is gone and hate is there
You better be careful, because it's Cape Fear
When your family is not your family
And your legacy is just a name there
There's a blank look in your mother's eyes
But your father is choosing who stays here
It is a power struggle, it is a tug of war
That is among the children, and it is not fair
Yeugh, who's going to stop the pain?
We are not the same
It's a free fall when I leave 'em (Whoa)
(If you love me, please don't judge me
My bloodline was not chosen (Ooh)
This bank account is not frozen
If you love me please don't judge me
Family, fortune, envy, jealousy.
Privilege, past legacy
Secret, sabotage, serious crime
Suicide, subtraction, selfish, pedigree, yeugh
Privilege, past legacy
Secret, sabotage, serious crime
Suicide, subtraction, selfish, pedigree, yeugh
Yes look
Look
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?"
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge Akinyele
Middle fingers of the ghost, screaming "Makaveli"
God save you Maria, the fairy of the scales
Two sides for each coin, so we are ready to pay
I still find a brick in my Tupperware
Two can get you four as a double challenge
Buried in the snow, bring a shovel here
Since I ran into a deficit
I had sent, [?]
I just want-I want, I was going to George Jetson
Niggas still treat me like George Jefferson
I'm sick shit, I like quick shit
I like to suck my cock, I buy you a sick truck
I buy you some new tits, I get you that nip-tuck
I start a new family, the condom made slipped
(I'm sick, I like a quick fuck, I like it)
I'm sick shit, I like quick shit
I like to suck my cock, I buy you a sick truck
We start another family, the made condom slipped
Zip closed, this, this closed
I like to suck my cock, I buy you a sick truck
I'm sick shit, I like quick shit
I like to suck my cock, I buy you a sick truck
I buy you some new tits, just stay (Aw, shit, aw)
I'm sick shit, I like quick shit
I like to suck my cock, I buy you a sick truck
I buy you some new tits, I buy you that nip-tuck
Just keep your lips closed, bitch, zip closed
* hubbub *
I'm only in the company of kings
I made a power move and it's all it seems
Before you sign me, I was coming out of my dreams
Every time a black wants to try to make a profit
People rush, three letters try to stop it
F-B-I-R-S, D-E-A
A short letter but still fucks the prosecutor
We play around with the rules as they try to crack the code
Louboutins leopard print prowling the concrete
Rollerballs come to life just like Jumanji
You know where to find me
Greenhouse a circle of superior whores
Mandarin, Gansevoort, any of the upper floors
35 grand, pulled it out of the top drawer
I still have a disposable phone in my sock drawer
It's like Raid! Spraying your roaches
The AK is an animal, it is fierce.
A nigga wants to sing, I hope he's the baddest
Watch that nigga disappear Hocus Pocus
Ring, ring, a nigger won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring, a nigger won't sing
'Less he is insomniac, he will die in a dream
It shows that I went to school in a small yellow bus
It never bothered me, strong arm robbery
I went from powdered gelatin donuts to taking Os
Look, I already grew and exploded
Will you take my word or make me do it
I'm a magnet to murder, when I'm in the mood
Being condemned by coroners when you walk in my shoes
I'm bad news, you niggas know the verdict, I'm dirty
Drop Phantom is milky, white on white
24 inch blades, I'm skating
Red eyes, smoking that bomb, I'm Satan
50 laps running around this tied up bitch, hitman
It's like Raid! Spraying your roaches
Watch that nigga disappear Hocus Pocus
Ring, ring, a nigger won't sing
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
Ring, ring, a nigger won't sing
'unless he is an insomniac he will die in a dream, ugh!
I sit with liars, duck tape and bleachers
They lost their soul, they just waited in the fire
Something from nowhere, a team full of MacGyvers
Deep sea diving for fish scale
Are you trying to find a better price? Man, that ship sailed
Take a breather and come back if that shit failed
Weight drop like an anchor; then you set sail
Hell freezes like the watch I put my sleeve on
Engine Devil-Scream when I turn the key
Yuugh! Re-Up Gang with Unit G
Try it on your tongue or watch a devil do it
I've got you hooked and I laugh as you lean
It's like Raid! Spraying your roaches
A nigga wants to sing, I hope he's the baddest
Watch that nigga disappear Hocus Pocus
Ring, ring, I keep that bitch clean
'Less he is insomniac, he will die in a dream
They think they know something about my life
Not in the same class, not on the same flight.
Maybe the same club, just not the same lights
I took her home with her
Boomerang, Stron'jay
Yo son - small, my nachos - big bell
Keep drinking that André
He spent 3 accumulations, that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim
They say I dress like Kanye
I am everything my rhymes say:
I hope your bitch doesn't fall for it
Your little time, you Hyundaii
You niggas off the couch - we stand on them
Drug money with a gang
D-boys keep playing the same
I just got a little glamor
YAH!
As I get hotter, the haters get crazier
Escalator up ... fuck a ladder!
Success calls, your world is shattered
They say it is fate; never mattered to me
Let's say you get money, let's go overboard
New Year with my bitch in the Palm suite
The Don Dotta, the boss
I jump squares on you muthafuckas; king him
Aston was ice blue, I went with Tron
Now handle that, bitch, handle that
White dripping from the pot like candle wax
Let it dry and then go on to the next
I'm Raekwon in the kitchen when I cook one
I'm light years past the Balenciaga pythons
You put them back after trying them
Forklift palate, black, stack
Cocaine jeans, no spurs, but I'm styling
Run late at night, put my Jimmy Fallon on
Request love (with? Uestlove) at that price they set
I played a different drum
GOOD. Music, but I speak it with another language
The callous becomes number 1
See us the night of the Grammys; bow ties and sashes
Ciroc soak bad bitch, I'm lying underneath one
Make me work for it, night nurse for it
In the morning she can get her heel and her purse
The way I'm killing shit, you should send a hearse for it
I'm glad you noticed
The truest nigga here
It's a little cold to be the coldest
Me and Timbo at those two doors, doing our "Otis"
Now witness the elect
It's different here
Monte Carlo nights, let me roll the dice
All i know is white
Dusts off
Mattress full of money, let it break the fall
Court! She used to fly on a friend pass
They say when the money goes you hope your honey lasts
I've been preaching from money, cash ... hoes
And I promise, I hardly see you
From where I am, it's so hard to see you
I have money, I've been different since then
Maybe it's me and my arrogance
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you, who are you anyway?
Who are you? We don't know you
I am the fire and the base
I am admired by the greats
This for each and every rap nigga
I look you liars in the face
Cold case, Rolls Wraith
Big dipper, constellation on the ceiling, look at the stars
Look at the jewels, all rock, no guitar
Who do you know better with crude oil?
Bogotá, she likes niggas
She gets a Range Rover Sport
And I got seats on the court from the best of niggas
I never bit that apple
I never lost my El Chapo
I can still grab it, put it in a bag and capsule
Covered in white as I entered the chapel
I'm so cold
From where I am, it's so hard to see you
I have money, I've been different since then
Maybe it's me and my arrogance
Who are you? We don't know you
Who are you? We don't know you
The last drug dealer
Red leather in a room full of Thrillers
Moms are zombies
Chase a nigger for the money, they're behind me
Woo, it sure looks like it has a printer
There are no rappers on that Sprinter
There are no saints, only sinners
What bitch hasn't screwed a winner?
I'm a blue ribbon black
Talk about you two niggas doves
Front five or better
Yes i have a mountain you can climb forever
Recorded in the emirate palace
I bring you the fear of God
Liva Don
Steven Victor on camera
Virgil what's up
They say this took confidence, I just call it patience
Because I was too proud to take this shit cadence
Knowing that the feds are watching me, private paparazzi
Still chasing me for war crimes like a Nazi
Against all odds, look at the judge trying to pacify me
The lucky die made my lawyers scream, Yahtzee
Who the hell can stop me? Run away from the freight train
The redemption of Mike Vick, great dog like a great Dane
12 cylinders 50 grams of arranged
These rappers get away with pushing these Illingers kids
Now it's hard feelings, I just put my roof up
Planetarium Push, the I-Max experience
They say I speak cocaine for 9 years
That means my record is over 9 years old
You niggas would have thought I was gone 9 years ago
But I'm still in the mix like 9 ounces and a straw
Nigga put your bag on, bitch put your bag on
Balenciaga Hobo so heavy that you drag home
Yes, look at my verses let you go
Swim in this drug lord Babylon's oasis
Three bitches, three different flights.
I'm glad it was four sides in that Paul Williams fight
The Wynn, the Bellagio, Las Palmas three nights
As long as they're apart, they're my three blind mice
You can't just rap this, the same mindset
I wish every mass boy could have a good shot at this
They say when one ends, a new chapter begins
I can live
You tell me if I can live
Two doors, four doors, sedan, roadster
We balling - ESPN highlights, posters
Tangerine Lambos, mimosa, make a toast
We at the Grammys, then Miami
Play Boca as if it were poker
I had a room in the Quinta
Full of soldiers, full of coca
Feel an ulcer
One hundred large on the sofa, upholstered
I'm twisted
Saying Heath Ledger Joker to you pranksters
If Tony, I hang up, send a hit, I'm Sosa
I'm cultured, I'm a legend
I'm Liva, I'm closer
To the best living writer
Two others, I'm the closest
Without covers, without drivers
Without mask, without witness
C-I-dos A
And 2 Chainz, with my bad bitch, it's my birthday
This life we live is for connoisseurs
Carnival, give our shape
Cabana Silk Pool Everyday
Mommy in Monolos, I'm in that Gucci polo shirt
With the intent in multicolored movement in my solo
My niggas who are in prison, I am their eyes and their ears
Every champagne night, for every laugh there is a tear
A picture is shown, every jail, every tear
Representing so my niggas know I'm here
Polyoroids are shown in every prison, every tear
From Virginia, never rated
Before us, no one did
Dope Boy Lane, a nigga paved it
When every nigga was afraid to say it
Sold a mill, spent a mill
We were grinding, the will of the Lord
Never thought of hiatus
All these bitches, high maintenance
But I love it, I attend
The deal fell, Tony saved us
After exploding, Al Qaeda
The feds rushed like Raiders
He brought down our coach, Al Davis
Regroup, the tears faded
Casket Drop one year later
Three albums, three major
Only critics in our favor
Turn it around, tornadoes
Our father, your neighbor
Couldn't tell me that God hates us
I was lost, I was tired
Malice found her way to our savior
Now author, he offers
One way to see it before you see the coffins
Way of seeing it before seeing vultures
A different way of seeing it, for culture.
Ross called them, Ye and all of them
In Hawaii, Jay and all of them.
I had the honor of being called
He ran away with it, "so horrified"
Entering the vault, it will land you
I'm back with P, it's a full circle
Just because Dre says
I made a million in a corner, sniffing
I didn't even have to stop
They say the numbers don't lie, well boy put your bands on it
Bet nigga, Patek Philippe on your peasant niggas
Commonwealth has open fault
I'm the boy of the alleged distributors poster
These niggas mention my name
With its little rumors and its little jewelers.
That is not a threat, that is not sweat
My little shooters ride little scooters
Damn, you know about a caravan full of millionaires
Hole in one, we are like billionaires
Chained, they change color, I'm Chamillionaire
This is sealskin walls, this is trap door floors
I traced nigga nigga without borders, we are above those laws
I'm really running from the R.I.C.O
Yeah i'm really dodging all those people
Uh huh, I run a marathon at the R.I.C.O
They are waiting for the sequel
Beats one yeah
Oh, they said there are 10 points higher
We have to go find that
I'm just praying that you protect me on this path
Rascal boys alf-alphabet
Tracking helicopters on the highway patrol
And I know that once I get there it sells
Mister father, I don't want to be a nuisance
I'm just praying that you protect me on this path
While I get this dough
Chevy Malibu; we graduate from them
It's only four letters, I'm not worried about a phrase (k-i-l-o)
Traveling the distance, staying out of the white line
Alphabet children praying for what they can find
I hate the Carolinas, racial profiler
Let's say you're smoking pot, fuck you talking
My urine is clearer than my mother's, with her church wig on
996 before putting on my Big
A thousand grams, a thousand hands, a thousand skins, a thousand bands
One hundred thousand dollars horse all star; we design
Mister father, I don't want to be a nuisance
I'm just praying that you protect me on this path
Rascal boys alf-alphabet
Tracking helicopters on the highway patrol
And I know that once I get there it sells
Mister father, I don't want to be a nuisance
I'm just praying that you protect me on this path
You niggas ain't taking real road trips
Route 13 with a vacuum seal
Legal prepaid on my window protector
Ice cream is in your Jack & Jill
Move weight from state to state; MACK trucks that I treat, MACK trucks that I fill
I feel better knowing that the donor is anonymous
See my diamond is growing
Tugboat or car trailer, we are snowing in summer
Reasonable doubt flows over your niggas
I've been getting it since '96 in black Vigors AC
Snub .38 with matte black trigger
When How Can I Be Down was full of crack niggas
Mister father, I don't want to be a nuisance
I'm just praying that you protect me on this path
Rascal boys alf-alphabet
Tracking helicopters on the highway patrol
It's not okay, but it's white and it's okay
And I know that once I get there it sells
I'm just praying that you protect me on this path
While I get this dough
And I always find, yes, I always find something wrong
You've been holding my shit too long
I'm so gifted to find what I don't like the most
Let's toast the assholes
Let's toast the assholes
Let's toast the bastards
Every single one of them that I know
Let's toast the assholes
That will never take your job
Baby I have a plan
Run away as fast as you can
She finds pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with women
But I'm not very good with that shit
Look, you could have me a good girl
And continue to be addicted to them
And I just blame you for everything
At least you know I'm good at it
And I always find, yes, I always find, yes, I always find something wrong
I'm so gifted to find what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to toast
Let's toast the assholes
Let's toast the assholes
Let's toast the bastards
Every single one of them that I know
Let's toast the assholes
That will never take your job
Run away as fast as you can
Run away from my baby
Run away
Run away
Just run away
... I have a plan
Run away from my baby
Run away
Run away from my baby
Run away
Why can't she just run away?
Baby I have a plan
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-did it, okay, okay, I admit it
Now choose your next move
Ichabod Crane with that damn top
Divide and go where? Use imitations again, right?
Leave it, Neiman's, buy it
Let's talk about mai tais, waitress, to top it off
Hoes like vultures, they want to fly in your loafers Freddy
You can't blame them, they have never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, honey, face it
You should go if you can't accept the basics
Lots of hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly established, the Rolex has no face
I'm just young, rich and tasteless
P!
It was never much romantic
I could never take intimacy
And I know that I hurt
Because the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you're at an advantage
Because you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'll manage
If one day you get up and go
You've been holding my shit too long
I'm so gifted to find what I don't like the most
Let's toast the assholes
Let's toast the assholes
Let's toast the bastards
Every single one of them that I know
Let's toast the assholes
That will never take your job
Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Let's talk about this payola (Payola)
You killed God's baby when it wasn't His will
And bloodshed, we can't talk about this shit (This shit is over)
The Lord is my shepherd, I am not a sheep.
I bring my offer, I won't preach
Wake up my demons, can you hear that man scream
Santeria (Santeria, Santeria, Santeria)
Triple back, they rush like Soviets (Soviets)
In the kremlin
Seeking Green as a Gremlin, Presidential Emblem
Presidential tint on this shit I'm in (Woo!)
I just placed orders and dropped dollars
Seen all the wrong moves, looking at the untouchables
We don't make vegetables, niggas lay flat
Welcome all the meat, then we heat them with irons
Your plans are counterproductive, think of betraying a priest
God save you Mary, repeat after me
You're leaving in the morning
Ha-ah, the angels will wait for you
It's the fire that I - know
It's the fire that I—
You're leaving in the morning
It's the fire that I - know
It's the fire that I—
Of all the things I've paid for
Know that there is no price when I make war
Ain't no more to pray for, niggas take advantage
Darken my door, they told me the day was gone
Are you listening, De'Von?
As I speak to your spirit, for the love of God
I'm dealing with heartbreak
Checking my ego, I'm living with lost faith
I'm back with this hit, nigga, have you ever seen Shark Tank?
I paid them in small bills, all of them in faces
I bet when we draw blood you niggas will draw a blank
Wear black, in association with All Saints
Our numbers are all done, my shooters say thank you
And all the praise, no prison can save
I leave you as Malcolm where X marks your grave
Hey it's probably better like this
It is cheaper when the chaplain prays
Santeria!
You're leaving in the morning
It's the fire that I - know
Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Let's talk about this payola (Payola)
You killed God's baby when it wasn't His will
And bloodshed, we can't talk about this shit (This shit is over)
The Lord is my shepherd, I am not a sheep.
I am a stone's throw from the streets.
I bring my offer, I won't preach
Wake up my demons, can you hear that man scream
Santeria (Santeria, Santeria, Santeria)
They say death comes three by three, how appropriate ('appropriate)
Triple back, they rush like Soviets (Soviets)
In the kremlin
Seeking Green as a Gremlin, Presidential Emblem
Presidential tint on this shit I'm in (Woo!)
Rottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock scream
The three of you are too accessible
Welcome all the meat, then we heat them with irons
Your plans are counterproductive, think of betraying a priest
God save you Mary, repeat after me
Sacred stories from home, they know
It is the Mamman Shata code.

Grab the baking soda (Evidence!)
Huh, huh (why?)
I will show you how to prepare it for Ricky dia!
(Scared money, scared money, scared money, holy money)
Scared money doesn't make money (Uh huh)
Scared money doesn't make money (Uh huh)
If I ever go bankrupt, I'll take your money
I'm on my north side, Philadelphia shit, furious south side
That boy and his bag and that boy is serious
Two girls give me head on their periods
Make 'em run threesomes,' cause they're kinda curious
Have my niggas in your crib when you wake up ...
Lil N.O.R.E is a shooter, I don't miss my target (target)
And fuck it I'm a rider
Magnum tied tight, so I'm bustin 'all your inside information
Nobody dies a virgin, life fucks us all
I was born poor, but I was educated
I'm an adult man, I pay my own bills
Great adventure money, I pay my own emotions
Scared money doesn't make money
Scared money doesn't make money
Scared money doesn't make money
If I ever go bankrupt, I'll take your money
Scared money doesn't make money
Scared money doesn't make money
(We'll be fine, ha ha)
Yes
You don't really have to ask where it came from
Trapped fire with the brick, made a strip dollar
I used to play with three dice, four fify and six dreams.
He escaped from the Po lights, thank goodness for the six speeds
If you're scared then you better have a black dog
If I ever go bankrupt, I'll take your money
Make my nigga snatch you bitch and rape you baby
Daddy said he got that job, just bring them pesos for me (the money)
When I was young I used to be the watcher
Now we are in the kitchen with pigeons cooking
Niggas gettin 'took, niggas gettin' pulled
I used to drive chargers now they are weird when I retire
Maserati, Panamera’s, Big Ghost’s
Assassin team, long clips, big toasters
Fuck you, they slap you, they get chauffeur
Nice coffin talking about the past, big rumors, ha!
Snippet lyrics
The Franklin Saint who broke the bank
I owe him my ties, the check is blank
Who are you to question how I show thanks?
We don't pray to the same God, we bet the same odds
My Saint Tropez is not related to your Saint odds
Three or four rappers are telling the same lies
Reflecting my excellence for me is exercising
Feeling like exodus, trying to be next to God
This is an exorcist, see through my ex's eyes
Hoping my ex will forgive all my extra lies (Woo)
Life goes on and babies are born
Bring the noise (Bring the noise)
Stronger
The head of these niggas is too light (Yah)
Take that (yeah)
Put the fear of God in these niggas, Pusha
It's like the changing of the guards
We are changing frauds
I gave heart to these lions as if my name ended in Oz
Long time coming, Sam cooking these bars
Still Eddy Caning, look at the demons sunk in the jaws (Yiuuck)
Push a ton, pledge allegiance to the raw
Known drug dealer who escaped without a scar (Yes)
I'm Buddy Lee, luckily, look I'm home
I wish I could jailbreak my team like an iPhone (Wooo)
Squilly told me to take this motherfucker by storm
So when I embark, here it begins to begin
I write my own happy ending, nigga pen sharp
My life is a Kodak moment, I need a framework for it
The attic couch needs a crane for this.
I'm fucked up, exotic bitch from the rain forest
So many bitches it's fuzzy, I'm to blame (Wooo)
God in heaven knows how I feel inside
Responsible for all this urban genocide
I will be convicted if I let the Yale campus vilify itself
As I lift this art form up high
I can't identify with your only death
We lose thousands around here, you speak a breath
Strangers looking like they're using a reference
My point of view of the zip camera for you is one step
Closer to clarity, not a parody.
How the cocaine took me without help (it's just my life)
I just shake it off, then shake my leg
A long time to make up is what Jacob said (Welcome home, baby)
The fans fell in love with your act, I tell you to break your leg
Then they fire guns that will awaken the dead
The only thing missing is seven dwarfs
Fun, Snow White sprayed all my repertoire
Angering the devil so much that I take off my shovel
They wait for me to level, escalators go up to you niggas
Uh, white gloves and a powdery face
Single-edged razor, powdered plate gems
The winter coupe hibernates, this is where I dominate
Bitches outdo themselves, dog, can't limit protocol
Don't turn your engines off 'cause blacks' motives are on
Rico nigga fuck
I'm sorry nigga I'm trying to get home
Well the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
But, sorry, nigga, I'm trying to get home, hey!
Let's say you have to hang up but that man won't let you go
Now we're talking about some niggas that he says he doesn't know
Graduate, getting money in the same blocks
But things changed and we didn't end up in the same box
I'm giving you the jail talk but you're not angry enough
I never thought I'd be the last man standing
I never thought I had to ask myself, 'Were you man enough?'
Long lyrics about how the streets brought out the best in you
Yes look i can read between the lines
So it's awkward when you call and I have to press 5
I'm sorry nigga I'm trying to get home
I think the feds are looking at me, can't you hear it in my tone?
So I'm sorry, nigga, I'm trying to go home, hey!
I tiptoed through the conversation on our calls
Tryna acts normal but the writer is on the walls
But I let it ride so I wouldn't be the next to fall
"They say that Terrion has been receiving money while I am not
And won't you try yelling at my bitch when I was home?
"No, he selling cars, it would be him and Lil Rome"
I'm just trying to make up for what I was saying on my phone
Nowadays niggas don't need shovels to bury you
Pointing fingers like stick carriers how they carry you
So much for death before dishonor
You could also have a robe and deck like Your Honor
I just sit and wonder I play by the numbers
When you ride like lightning, then you crash like thunder
Seen your baby mom she doesn't even know if she should talk
What the hell is there to say knowing your king is weak now saying
I'm sorry nigga I'm trying to get home
Well the walls are talking to me and I know you think I'm wrong
Let's talk real niggas, let's talk real nigga
How many niggas did you meet wielding no kill, nigga?
We had a legacy that he killed, I have to use that
I bet the man inside his mirror doesn't look back at him
Break your heart when the man you call your brother
Be the same one who launched all the funds.
I called my mom mom, I was at my graduation
When I signed my record deal, you were my motivation
Uh, great friends now is not affiliation
Divided by the time he was facing, once he told me that
I'm sorry nigga I'm trying to get home
I'm sorry nigga I'm trying to get home
I think the feds are looking at me, can't you hear it in my tone?
So I'm sorry, nigga, I'm trying to go home, hey!
My bitch is hot, like she's out of tune
My hot bitch, like she came up the place (D-D-D-up)
She AP and really eats a nigger's watch (D-ing up the spot)
My bitch is hot, like she's out of tune
Call the bitch Swiffer 'cause all she knows is swipers
Fuck a rap nigga, but she don't need him the wife
(D-D-D-ing above the place)
Travel to the islands in Thailand
She doesn't know if it's Lanvin or Lanvin
All she wants is the monograms and my bands.
(What, what are charcuteries?)
(Man, is, is when you go to your hotel room)
(And they got the cheese and the fucking pepperoni)
(Cut on a wooden board, waiting for you)
New levels of flavor, shit, she'll be teaching me (Nigga)
I have a bitch that will dominate your card
Every page inked, she and the bitches come together
They think they hear the drum and the machine when it syncs
Heads boppin ', boop-bopty-boop-bop
Bustin 'down watches
Whip rental in garages
She doesn't cheat, but she carries
Lotta double C, double G (You know how I do it)
Double exhaust is double V (you know how I do it)
You niggas talk she fuck me
But she only cares about who got the bag first
I tried to say, "Go to real estate school."
She says, "Don't you see these fucking drug dealers badges?
You know the rush of knowing that bitches hate you
I have a bitch that will dominate your card
Nice with visas, passports are art
Every page inked, she and the bitches come together
They think they hear the drum and the machine when it syncs
Heads boppin ', boop-bopty-boop-bop
Who do you think showed you that Chanel made the socks?
Bustin 'down watches
Whip rental in garages
She doesn't cheat but she carries
My bitch is hot, like she's out of tune
My hot bitch, like she came up the place (D-D-D-up-)
She AP and really eats a nigger's watch (D-ing up the spot)
My bitch is hot like I'm climbing the place (D-D)
I see you supplying the strip
These niggas have been demons for this shit
Push!
In a short year, I turned dreams into nightmares (Hah)
Let the game gods know that I am here (Bangladesh)
For you new muthafuckas, Buzz Lightyears
Ahead of you all, so watch out for the tightrope (Yeahh)
I inspire all the rappers you could quote (What?)
Looking at you, niggas like whites (Haha)
You have the right to believe in all your high hopes (Uh huh)
When you can trick someone with the correct trick (Who executes it?)
I let you sing to them, hold on emotionally to them
No pillow, you're just selling them a dream (Wake up, niggas)
I just laugh at them, what the hell is he doing? (Hahaha)
I just want to flip it (Hah)
I just want to sell it (Hah)
I just want to flip it (Hah)
I just wanna sell it (Yeahh)
I just wanna turn it around (Yeahh)
I just want to sell it (Yeahhh)
It's so obvious in my clothes that you can smell it
Dust everywhere, like I drugged the chalk (forty racks in my pocket)
Hit the prize; porthole go through it
Music; I speak it, it's an art (tell your bitch to enter)
Let the critics praise, the graphics do it
80 cents could save a child, but I'm not willing to do it
I only buy through it; cook and chop
We have our own thing; Drop the top (Wooo)
This is block music; Waka Flock to her (Push)
I just want to turn it around
I just wanna sell it (Yeahh)
I just want to flip it (flip it)
I just want to sell it (sell it)
It's so obvious in my clothes that you can smell it
I'm so raw, running from the law
Here to raise the bar; chain, flawless
Let's say it's whiplash when I let my neck thaw
On those two doors, no tires on the car
Look what I saw, the best gets better (Dope man, dope man)
Look, but you cannot touch; I'm a damn leper
K-I-L; I'm just waiting for a letter
Oh there it is; let the triple beam measure
Re-Up is the gang and we bet whatever (Yeahhh)
I just want to flip it (push)
I just want to sell it
I just want to flip it (Hah)
I just want to sell it (Hah)
I just wanna turn it around (Yeahh)
I just want to sell it (what?)
Push, you need a hit, nigga, come see me
Bangladesh
Pusha T
I have to [?]
I get up early in the morning
Greet my neighbors like wassup? wassup?
And ... a little more, hit my truck
Everyone in my city shows me love
Because I have the speakers hammering
Speakers go hammer, speakers go hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer
The Dough Boy version, yeah
Back off this black bitch free to go
Everything was fine just make a key
Price for the 20 everything I need to know
Still moving snow like it's 3 underneath
Detroit is tough, while Cape Cod
Little niggers bees to the guard base
I've been cooking, are you confusing?
Shot city plug has the city trash
Mad max 5 stacks before looking at this weather
Little circle, bad bitches think they're smart
Mix 1 way complete and recycle better
Sit them in a curve when you're done with them
She unaware of a girl wants to come with them
I can't blame other niggas, they can't run with them
Around the crack of dawn
Greet my neighbors like wassup? wassup?
Everyone in my city shows me love
Because I have the speakers hammering
Speakers go hammer, speakers go hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer
The Dough Boy version, yeah
Look, I could tell you that I won't be for long
You're not doing enough homework on your nigga
Do it well
I get up early in the morning around sunrise and
Greet my neighbors like what's going on?
And tattooed, hit my truck
Everyone in my city shows me love
Because I have the speakers hammering
(The Dough Boy version, yes)
Stand back on this bitch niggas free to go
Price for the 20 everything I need to know
You draw hard, while I stay hard
You niggas Lil B's to God Based
I've been cooking, have you been confused?
Givenchy motorcycle leathers
Mad Max, 5 stacks for such a worn look
Little circle, bad bitches think they're smart
The mixed form and recycle better
She oblivious to her girl wants to come with them
I can't blame her; Other niggas can't run with them
Usain Bolt through these bitches then I'm done with them
So Liv
This guy had a Range Rover like you
I said Range Rover, where? This is not a fucking Range Rover
This is a G55; 130 thousand dollars of disposable money in winter
You must be out of your fucking mind
Look, I could tell you that I won't be for long
You're not doing enough homework on your nigga
Do it well
Drummers
Yes, my success is your nightmares.
Awake but the sack man is here
Odds paid, I've won every streak here
I paid you just to get it on your flights, yeah
I'm not the sequel to any of you
We don't even share the same prequel
I'm a drug dealer, you're a pill popper, nigga credit card
I'm shotta
You niggas is opera, I'm more blocks
All I wanna hear is choppa, choppa
Authenticity outweighs an Oscar
Emmy, he really has the semi, really sold Demi
More than these rappers with their ghost stories
It is a war outside, no man is safe from
Where they pray I fall from grace
Push
I came to G.O.O.D. Music with the checkered past
Some said it was over, checkered flag
But like the LVs in this in this checkered bag
However, Sean is young, tell Ye "Stay neutral"
While the president makes the company fruitful
I just want to make my own dark, twisted, beautiful
I have to factor the dust under my cuticles
Still, if you're really looking, we don't stop at performance
Look, because the ball is a sport, look at my real
That's the 'Rari and Porsche, a quarter of a thousand'
Look at my name on the bill, bitch naked on the pill
Grab some L on the flight, let's smoke it with evils
The art of hustle, still a supreme emotion
Blowbama's possession is a license to kill, yeah
Yes ... I just ordered one, my nigga
Yes...
I'm still a snowmobile, it blows louder than the tuba
Designated shooters, turn marijuana into woolers
Atlanta condo, money counters like NASDAQ
In that glass, the motor is the rear
I'm still feeding divas like I'm feeding the meter
Holy father to them, I'm not talking about Jesus either
I'm just a name and a number with the means to contact you
His army, MCM in gym shoes
You know that hymn better, he's been preaching
You motherfuckers are bloodsuckers, they've been leeches
Sido Baller, Sido Jacob, Sido distributor
Every killer, no filler, iller state
Fraudulent niggas, you Zoolander, Ben Stiller
When it comes to shooters, my niggas are trained to go
Thirty five hundred, just point and give them a name
They throw niggas again, they go for the rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck you
Big difference between a tenant and a landlord
Lufthansa I robbed, nigga, or that bitch Winona
Stop comparing me to the rappers because they're in their time
I could have crossed the known mark every blue
But these brand names for a brand owner are not new
She is not the angel you think, she also reincarnated
I build mine from time fed and drug lines
You captured the headlines and the co-signs
Young niggas pranking my rivals
Just like the Bible doesn't burn, like these bullets don't spiral
But the only purpose of a pawn is completely suicidal
I'm just talking to the world like it's me and you
When it comes to shooters, my niggas are trained to go
And they practice with bitches that break codes
Thirty five hundred, just point and give them a name
They throw niggas again, they go for the rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck you
Nothing but cash here, this sweater is cashmere
The ceiling is translucent, it is only glass there.
The car is a concept, what comes next is my last year.
My future is bright, you can never last here
I'm in the top five, listen, who was in fashion last year?
Five beats and I feel like Flash here
Because what I captured is the beast unleashed on the grass
Telfair, handmade custom suits
About Bottega Veneta, high tops unbuttoned
S550 drop top is unimaginable
My hand fell off and then released it
Practice it, niggam brick, break, break dance
When it comes to shooters, my niggas are trained to go
And they practice with bitches that break codes
Thirty five hundred, just point and give them a name
They throw niggas again, they go for the rappers the same
You don't know me, nigga, fuck you
I say hello sun
I say hello sun
Oh how the day can be so long
Beyond the spiritual
I need a more real view
I hold you a mirror
These are not new problems, they are just old ways
I once see the sun turn into Freddie Gray
Just another dead black, just another dead black
Send another to the EDFs, send another to the EDFs
Not guilty, I'm still dirty
In fox eyes, we the dark side
So they tell you lies
Through a television, C-N-B-C
C-N-N, Don Lemon, not Kweli when you know me
To be me
Brenda's baby next to the sweet lady
The same project as Candy Man, where they still do it hand in hand
Sunday to Sunday, the pastor only wants one day
Grandma praying someday
But God can't hear him over the gun game
Court! Still a target, but the badge is the new rope
Yes, we all see it, but cell phones are not proof enough
So we still lose
Oh how the day can be so long
I say hello sun
Oh how the day can be so long
While they test your patience, they only test my reach
Funeral flowers, every 28 hours.
He vowed to protect and serve, but who really got the power?
Reviewing your assignments
Building prisons where the mountains are
Laptops are for county kids
They will never write this again, as they rewrote history
The fact that the Statue of Liberty was black is a damn mystery
And so it goes, every truth is not told
All these cops clear up and steal lives
Every goose doesn't put gold whoa
Just another dead black, just another dead black
Send another to the EDFs, send another to the EDFs
Public enemy, I'm Chuck D
Flavor Flav in Louis V, but I'm Huey P
Court! The new elite, it's you or me
Let the sunlight, because its dark clouds try to ruin me
It's more and more and more than Baltimore
Broken patience, missing patience, oh lord
I say hello sun
I say hello sun
Angry to the devil, so much that I take off the shovel
An icy black while I'm freezing the bezel
Escalator go up to you niggas
White teeth and a face of dust
Single Edge Razor Gym Stars on Dust Plates
The winter coupe hibernates, this is where I dominate
Trapstar Street Niggas Longest Nominee Nominee
In general
Although the clocks are overhauled, the bitches get chased
They say the snake is the closest Remember to cut the grass
Rich black shit!
Yes!
Not ready for this nephew (NAH!)

Everyone knows me, nigga, I'm a star
Pimpin what she does, she explodes like a pill
1800 then my hand spilled it
You smoke in an area, I smoke in a drum
Burned at the club, my hands on her thigh
A nigga from the east side put his hood up in the sky
She likes what I say, I like what she does
Turn that butt and drop it like a fool

Snoop Dogg said so, we're going crazy
Swishers everywhere, burning

I'm gonna start mine like a bitch dig this
One movement, two glances, three little breezes.
All in line, alright, trying to hit my breeze
You are not the dog, they do not believe me
They want me to speak that talk, I'm like fear ladybug
Now you know it's me
We go to the palace where I lay my head
Said the ten-room house with the bed made
You're really shooting with a player
Who found your nails and cares for your hair?
What do you all prefer? Cats or dogs?
Jeans or skirts? Music or movies?
We turn it on first
When we do, it stays. What happens?
Said you can't have enough
The one we don't act like
We turn it on first
When we do, it stays. What happens?
You said you can't have enough
The one we don't act like
After the party, yes, yes
You know I wanted to let you know how I felt, let me flow again
I'm going on a little trip
Because I have plenty of space for your time to consume you
Girl can you feel this
Blacks are fake and Snoop Dogg is the most real.
You with me is like a child
I understand it as I live and I do it as I want it
Someone told me a long time ago
If you have a better flow then I guess I'm going to flow
Just name what you need
We turn it on first
When we do, it stays. What happens?
Said you can't have enough
The one we don't act like
We turn it on first
When we do, it stays. What happens?
You said you can't have enough
The one we don't act like
After the party, yes, yes
Or you just want to navigate LA
Let me kiss you on your belly
And take some movies of your death
I know you like it when I become a monster, avoid
And your mom thinking that I was just your home boy
You know I'm down with the D-low
I hope your baby daddy doesn't try to pull a bow D
I know I'm a dumb girl, you have people
You have to have some joy and laughter
To each chapter of relationships
Now at first you will feel ecstasy
It is easy to capture, let me know what you are looking for
When we do, it stays. What happens?
Said you can't have enough
We turn it on first
When we do, it stays. What happens?
The one we don't act like
After the party, yes, yes

{* laughing *}
Hey, Snoop Dogg, can you pour me another glass of that Coolaid?
Upgrade, just like your phone game
Big Snoop Dogg, I do my thing
My rap style is dynamite
You do it like you do it
Where I come from, if you sound like another nigga
That's called biting, yeah you the other nigga
Let my behavior be the meaning, I got you screaming
Have a big car, rap star
Ten bedroom mansion with a lake in your backyard
So disobedient, taste is the main ingredient
And you are missing, everything is in your jacket
But I'm hot and as cool as a fan
Standing on the corner with a Coolaid stall
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid man
I'm hot (he's cool), but just as cool as a fan
Bitches drink lemonade, but I'm the Coolaid man
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid man
Now baby, Mr. Coolaid Man, Mr. Coolaid Man.
Now baby, yeah, girl, that's the Coolaid Man, they call him the Coolaid Man
Now drink!
The reason why I say I'm the Coolaid
Look at all the flavor I gave the gizzame
Just add water, it doesn't heat up
You got all your slump from Father Doggy Dogg
Research smart and intellectual minds
Bet a dub this shit explodes
Bitches niggas mix love with this hip-hop
Just to be, now what the fuck are we on
Look, don't screw around loc
Cause every now and then niggas need a line of this drug
Cause I'm hot and as cool as a fan
Bitches drinking lemonade, I'm the coolaid man
Standing on the corner with a Coolaid stall
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid man
I'm hot (he's cool), but just as cool as a fan
I'm standing on the corner with a Coolaid stall
Cool as a fan, yeah, bitch, I'm the Coolaid man
Now baby, Mr. Coolaid Man, Mr. Coolaid Man.
Now baby, yeah, girl, that's the Coolaid Man, they call him the Coolaid Man
Now drink!
S-N-double-O-P, Mr. Coolaid Man, that's who he is
Don't let the trap hit you, baby
Now drink!
Mr. Coolaid Man, it's great.
And all the ladies in the hall want to lean on me
So I stand up, I do everything, I never slip
In the microphone talking big shhh
I can't curse, I'm on the radio
Hello to the lady though
With Cosmic Kev, the big Snoop Dogg on top of his head
I need fur on my eardrums
Here he comes, here he, here he comes
Yes, this is freestyle, LBC style, G style
I like to flip and dive
So you can ride and roll and get control
And let me show you how cold I am
I could get, I could get up
I tripped over it and dropped it
I never dropped it
I need to use the phone
Could you give a dogg a bone?
I'm leaning over and everyone looks at me screaming
They want to take a photo of the dubbing D O
All the ladies in the hall love
Even the big boss wants to take a picture
Because he knows it doesn't cost
Big Snoop Dogg, I'm going to start the show
Yes take a picture with me
In the middle, I'm on the side
Wiz on the left so you know how we travel
And when we got there we both got high
And they got mad and told us to turn it off because "fire"
We kept smoking and I took another hit
For Cosmic Kev, I said "great, I have a freestyle
And then I went in and dropped it for him. "
He pushed the record and took it out
Baby start filming it now
She has the camera, I have the rap
And got the dippy-dippy scratch on his back
My music is dumb, I never drown
And if I wasn't rapping, I'd probably be broke
No, I'm lying to everyone
It's just Big Snoop and I'm the Top Dogg
That means i'm going to get money
No matter what I do, it's sunny
It could be raining, it could be hitting
You could be talking, I could be singing
I could be slandering, I could be bringing
You are what you need, but I stop and proceed
It's big Snoop D O double the G
Ease ... and when you're done with the microphone, smell
I'm like the breeze
Horsepower, 99
Everything is so good
I have to say something because these fools bothered me so much
I still haven't won a Grammy
I still haven't called my grandmother
Because when it comes to rap, you're the only one
You don't need a Grammy, you have a Soul Train award
And you keep smoking reefer, and these suckas are broken
But you can't touch me, cause I'm only cold
When it comes to freestyle at the top of my brain
And I'm 40, but it looks like I'm 17
Because when I'm rockin ', I'm so clean
And I'm on the hip-hop scene
Because my rhyme is so clean ...
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Snoop dogg
Here we go
Nigga, understand, West Coast Son of Sam
Because that is not shit for a real Crip, because
You'll swallow every clip before a nigga slip, cuz
LBC, yes we have love
213, rest in peace, Nate
It's real on the field, keep your heels tied
I smoke a pound when I move, yeah
The world is my chair
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Now i'm buying another bag again
Marking the grip, I will never slip, I put the "R" in Crip
C above, G above, B above, aw
He's up, we're up, he's up
Get a real woman, don't trust these girls
And when you're around the police, don't say three much
I stopped drinking because my liver works
But now I bring back the savage like a rental
Gold and black flannel, grip grip on a handle
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, countdown, 1
Snoop dogg
Go crazy on this mothafucka right now
Go crazy on this bitch, damn it now
Go crazy on this bitch right now
C-R-I-P, they'll never see a G like me again
So take a look at a winner
A rich crip, the shit can get
Swizzy countdown
I'm sitting in a crowded tank
Because if it's me, it's on (Sup, friend)
Loc, the One with the black knights has just been robbed
And fell to the ground
Not a cat because of his scratch or his shoes
A point for blacks
They rolled it up, puffed it up and howled
He's still alive to know what's next
Any nigga they catch slipping they'll put it to rest
So I did my best to protect my chest
O'clock all night because if I sleep I could
Don't do it in this world of fools
I could lose if I'm slipping on these county blues
1 - Niggas fuck in the County Blues
You can lose, if you fall asleep you lose
Why? Because this is gangbangology
Look at the first verse that is scared
But wait, you have to take a trip upstairs
Where fools always wonder?
Young black, welcome (welcome)
I'll be "God damn nigga, what are you going to do?"
Stay down because I know that the one who slides licks
And caught, fucked up and all that
Put him in a row of assassins, where assassins kill and ignore
Say you don't gang bang
Well, why is your friend, baby boo, calling you by your gang name? (Sup nigga?)
But damn it, that's deep
And it looks like they tried to crawl, take a look?
Creep like T-L, on the D-L
But fail, try to tell Deputy Bell
Well that shit was disrespectful, nigga
That's what was overhauled and the cover for
Nigga you're a ho (you're a ho)
Uhh, and I'll let you know (I'll let you know)
I mean, niggas are bitches, when they get behind the wall
But I'm not talking about all of you
Cause I know some niggas from the C-P-T
And some great friends from L-B-C and South Central
Repeat 1
{* the singer sings until he vanishes *}
I, uh, yeah
Doggy Dogg back at the muthafuckin house
But this time I will have realistic advice
Take you niggas on a trip to the county jail
You know what I'm saying?
But if you haven't ...
I'm trying to see what nigga these niggas are up to
Note that the one with the black Nikes has just been stolen
And he fell to the ground
The deputies are not around, so he will be beaten
They take their bag of money, now they take their shoes
A quick approach for blacks
Now he's asking for help, you see?
But when you do it like this, each man by himself G
Especially if you're black like me
Watch it back for the niggas, the Mexicans and the crackas, G
There's no love jumping
I have seen that some of the biggest OGs are thrown
Do you think I'm lying?
Well take a trip, Mr. Hardass Muthafuckin 'Gangsta Crip
Get chained for a whole week at 43
But if you don't hit, look at the trick
Directly, you know what I say
It's not like you can't go black
But when you go, it's like you on death row
So if you have orders little nigga busta-ass
You could also pay them muthafuckas before they baffle you
Understand what I say?
I see the first verse that your ass is scared
But wait, you have to take a trip upstairs
Young black man, welcome to 95 hundred
Faced every second about where you're from
With whom slang and with whom you hit
And don't try to lie like you don't hit
Because here comes one of your friends calling you by your street name
Now you sit on a roof just freezing like an icicle
Oh shit, here we go another fight
But this time the es is deep
Niggas are winning, so drag
Direct to the deputy
That was disrespectful
Busta-ass punk, nigga made a bitch, you'll be living in a trunk
Ya catch the county blues
Right
I have hoes, I have cars, I have this, man, I'm the ball.
Man, you ain't got no business since you been in this damn
You know what I'm saying?
Nigga, the county jail is no fucking joke
I'm going to break this shit for all of you
I could really hear what I say
My message was smooth and direct G
You must check it before you destroy yourself
Because Doggy Dogg is a muthafuckin 'pig
As you slip, you get something on your back
By me or one of my BG
And busta-ass niggas don't really wanna see me
Inside or outside the facilities
Don't come as a bitch
You tried to play hard but we found out you're a snitch
Telling niggas to get out fast
I pushed your damn guts
Now you have a fagot that pays you to like nuts
Droppin 'dimes in fools
You fucked in the ass
Wearin 'County Blues
It never fails
county jail
Hang a black to dry, you know what I mean?
But, I'm going to kick some freestyle shit so they can really hear ...
What is it made of
*Gunshots*
Blacks can never have fun!
These streets are ...
Walking down the avenue
Crazy!
From Hollywood to South Central
These streets are ...
Crazy!
Long Beach to Compton
Always up to no good
Cra ... crazy! (Crazy)
Always up to no good
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy
I could take you in and out and where will it be
Now as crazy as he is, you know this house for me.
I'd never quit, you know that's wrong for me
I stay down, you see me in the corners, G
At your local liquor store, get some Optimos
And if I'm off limits then I have to fuck
Keep it low on the shore W-W-W-West
I sign some autographs and then get ghosts
A-humph .. yes, I love my people
But half of all you fools are throats
In the true knowledge that the streets will have you
And when you walk by my side, I think everyone needs to know ...
These streets are ...
Walking down the avenue
From Hollywood to South Central
Crazy!
Always up to no good
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy
Crazy!
In the flow of Highway 110, back to the block
In the Seven Deuce Coupe, hoppin 'hippin' the hop
Drinking a little chicken with my infrared nephew
Young pimp in the routine tries to align his head a little
I had fun, I did, I did, in the West we run
It doesn't matter where you're from, whether you're old or young
Rocker we're raw like ooh-la-la
Yeah nigga we're shaking the police
You niggas out there are just making it hot
But don't stumble if you're pretending too much
Because if you think you're going to slide through California
Without being hit ... brother, you're wrong
(Always up to no good!)
I really love my son, I grew up together and everyone but him
(Always up to no good!)
Hell yeah I love them I knew them all
So I married the general, but she ...
(Always up to no good!)
We can't hang anymore because I'm a dance of all of you and he
(Always up to no good!)
Let me tell you about these streeeets
These streets are ...
Walking down the avenue
(Always up to no good!)
(Always up to no good!)
From Hollywood to South Central
These streets are ...
(Always up to no good!)
Long Beach to Compton
Ave ...
(Always up to no good!)
Crazy! (Crazy)
Van Nuys to Santa Ana, crazy
Crazy!
Fred made a fool of you for that beat, man
Check it out, it's Julio G, Westside radio
Your ears are tuned to Tha Blue Carpet Treatment
I'm going to take all the Latinos to the Playa Larga
And I'm going to let Snoop tell you what happened to him
Over here, we crip or die ... all day, we crip or die ... when you're young, crip or die ... that's the first thing you learn on the east side
Over here, we Crip or die ... moms and dads, they Crip or die ... that's all we know, it's Crip or die ... so watch how you move on the east side
(See how you move when you are on the east side, when you are on the east side, when you are on the east side ... See how you move when you are on the east side, when you are on the east side, when you are on the east side)
Lock and load rock n roll sock em up n watch em fold
20 homies 2 minutes gangbang overhead
I want to be a gangsta, this is the first step
Choose who you want to travel with, that's your birth game
Now get yourself some warmth and learn how to recover
There are no rats and naps where you work, really
My family chose the shield.
But I am a Dub with Pittsburgh Steel
Jargon drugs with them thugs that will divide your grill
LBC and C is as big as possible, for me, we
E-A-S-T-S-I-D-E, C-R-I-a la P, it's him
Gangsta, laugh and get to work
Patch in my eye like Spuds McKenzie
Knock on the wall where your friends and friends are
You can't have the crown without the cross
I'm talking about that somewhere in your life there is a cross
That takes you to the father
Ladies and gentlemen
I know, I know it's coming
A blessing comes my way, yeah
It does not come in houses
Worth more than silver and gold, yeah
Even when the world thinks it's a joke
Churches speaking holy, but without ghosts
People dying, losing hope
Say if God is for us (oh yes, yes)
So no one can be against us
So I will keep running this race, yeah
And no one killing my faith, yeah
Say if God is for us (oh yes, yes)
When I get to heaven, I'm going to say Amen
Say amen yeah
Take my crown and run and dance
Praise be because I did it in
Made in
Yes sir
When I get to heaven, I will say Amen
Say amen
because one day one day
One day one day
I will wear my crown
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
I will wear a crown
So, so many people so cold
because they really don't know you
Oh thank you sir
Standing screaming God we trust
But do they really love you? (they do it, they do it)
Connected by the truth that hurts us now
Pray for the road that keeps closing in on me
Say if God is for us (oh yes, yes)
So no one can be against us
And no one killing my faith, yeah
Say if God is for us (oh yes, yes)
Woah, I can't wait to see your face, yeah
When I get to heaven, I will say Amen
Take my crown and run and dance
Praise be because I did it in
When I get to heaven, I will say Amen
Say amen
because one day one day
One day one day
I will wear my crown
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
Yes
One day, one day, one day
I will wear a crown
Seeing believe is really knowing the unknown
Something we can't see
So far, that has been blind to our eyes
Introduction:
G shit, LBC shit, remember how it used to be?
Mmm, you remember a lot
(Verse 1)
1982 now what should I do?
All I want to do is claim RTC
Because all my ICG friends
So let's do this for LBC
In my eleven gettin slicker
Buying liquor from a non-liquor store
Quick to fuck a ho and get the big homie for a 64
Although you won't miss it
Cause I'm too skilled for him to notice he's gone
Now he's trying to take my dome
Hanging everything in front of my house
Now it's really on
Cause I'm a dome this nigga and I catch him for his shit
Now your bitch is my bitch
Isn't it a trip like I'm a cripple?
But I will not hesitate to try another representative
And by then I'm 17 years old if I'm not in that corral
Ridin, hoo-bangin as Mack 10
Back on the streets again and tied
I'm looking for the niggas with the wrong fakes
Nigga, I don't give a shit, nigga, I don't give a shit
Straight Bang Bang Bang Banggin Banggin
Chorus:
Shoot them, shoot them bang bang
Everything is fair in the gang bang
X2
I want to live it
I mean, I would like to live it, you know
Bang to tha boogie and boogie to tha bang
The sound of my girl when she feels she needs to sing
(Verse 2)
I got a gang of bitches riding on me now
Not to mention that the house boys locked in tha p now
See now that the road becomes unstable but you can't break
Beware of them hoodrats, snakes
Because E told me a little story that left me a little hurt
The little friend made too much dirt and went to work
Now he's running away and dying of thirst
Stayin in your girls place on the 21st
And when they bother you, that's not the worst
Because he might not get to the last verse
But in the meantime, back in tha p now
Hoo-bangin and slangin straight cigarettes
I squeeze you baby Brotha just to get a rep
* Chorus x4
(Verse 3)
This is the pound for life
This is Dogg Pound for life, yeah right
What you join the game for you lil busta
Now you want to cross us out and disrespect us
Musta thought we were busts or sumthin
I leave two niggas, I don't need you niggas
That's what i learned about gang bang
If you go to gang bang
So whether you play with blood or blood
You better come for a young thug
Because you will be hit not by bangas
But by Johnny Law because they love to hang us (I hear you)
I ride with your dog if you can take me to the border
My baby mommy flipped over and dived with my daughter
I should trip over that bitch I should turn over to that bitch
I can't trip because she looks like my daughter and that shit
So I'm loading my clip and I'm going high

We stack it differently, actually specifically
Corleone's song so strong that it puts you in your own zone
Diaper head, dreaded, yes, I said so
Take your comb and grab your bones
Because the Dogg junkyard brought him a salsa train back
Many niggas fell, yeah I let them ring

Those Hollywood nights
They drive me crazy
Huh, is there so
They love it when I let my hair down
From Jessica Alba to Jessica Simpson
Even Jessica Biel wants to know how I feel.
So I let them come to my back table
Roll up and lick the paper if you can
Bottles of everything, models and everything.
Cocaine castles, I'm not sniffing
But baby, that plate in that movie is stumbling
So, I invite her to my party
Blonde hair, long legs, a real live Barbie
No autographs, I'm not signing now
Act like you've been around a boss, bitch calm down
My life is like a great highlight
Welcome to the fucking Hollywood nightlife
Every night I'm in the limo, excursion
With some whites, some Asians and Persians
They flirt, and I'm sure they suck
One night with the Dogg and his curtains.
She says she wants to be an actress
Take one, take two, now cut
Now turn around and let friend Damani fuck
Huh yeah here we go again
I have to go behind the club just to get in
They say I'm too shocked
All the screaming and screaming and pushing, oh yeah, I opened them
I'm in the back of the club getting a massage
Smoking with one of the Marleys, "One Love"
I'm taller than gas, I refuse to pass
Hollywood Night School my nigga join my class, come on
Meet me at the Roosevelt, low cabin room
I'm at Sunset (where are you?) At The House of Blues
I just stepped in for a quick cameo
Me and Leonardo DiCaprio
Oh life, night after night, flight after flight
You'll have a burnt black, some hoes turned out
You know it's silly when you see the missing Dogg
Cameras flicker, police pass
Every little model wants to give me some action
So I let them kick them, then I let them lick
Get a little m_nage, during every visit
I wouldn't leave it even if I got paid
The L.B. raised me and hollywood is crazy
Father, we pray this morning for the spirit of wisdom and revelation, and the knowledge of Jesus Christ.
We thank you and pray for the sick, the locked up
We pray for young people, we pray for babies.
We pray for all who are sick this morning
All who are lost this morning
In the name of Jesus, we thank you
Hallelujah, we thank you for your love, we thank you for your power, thank you
Satan the Lord rebukes you
Satan the Lord rebukes you
Satan the Lord rebukes you
He has been defeated again
I changed my hustle to witness
Gave me a new message
Gave me a new song
So now I can't be threatened
For the drama and the tricks you bring
Because I will not be defeated
(Satan)
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (Oh Satan)
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (Satan the Lord rebuked you)
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (Ooh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (Ooh, Satan the Lord rebukes you)
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (You are defeated)
He has been defeated again. (again - listen)
Open your ears - open your eyes
Everything you try to do
(or we will) we will never win and present you. (Oh my)
The promised enemy (enemy, promised) said he promised
Will steal and destroy
But the Bible says that no weapon was formed against me.
It will prosper or take my joy!
My happiness!
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (Wooh! Satan, the Lord rebukes you.)
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (Ha, oh, Satan)
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (Scold you, yeah)
He has been defeated again. (Wooh defeated - everyone sings)
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (He is)
Satan, the Lord rebukes you. (I Snoop, you explain it to me)
He is defeated (can I get a real witness here)
He is defeated (I need some of the saints to open their mouths and say it with me, oh!)
He is defeated (I don't fear terror at night)
He's defeated (I'm not afraid of the day arrow either, uh huh)
He is defeated (Jesus made me a promise)
He is defeated (he has all the power in his hand)
He has been defeated again!
(O Lord, we rebuked the devourer and the deceiver ...)
You make me say [x3]
Ohh
You make me say [x3]
I'm from the east coast but I'm falling
So hot a nigga made me walk wrong
I'm from the suburbs but it's so good
Make a good girl want to get to the neighborhood
You make me say (you have me speaking different languages [inverted]) [x3]
So good it made me speak different languages
Ride you, try to find you, fill you up, revive
Carry on with your bad me, baby, baby, cause I adore it
Wear it all the time you know my love
We are sure of pure, I will even seduce
Jay has Beyonce, I have Shante
You know what it's about when I take them out
It feels so good i had to sing
Get it, get it now, we fly out of town, checking in a suite
Pedicure on my feet
Miss Bow Wow, Queen of the People
Aiyyo Jaz, tell them how I left it
Is this how you look? Is this how you walk?
Is it the way you cook? Is this how you speak?
No playtime during the day making love
Children go to school, we can act like fools
Skinny dip in the pool, make it really smooth
Miss Bow Wow, Queen of the People
Aiyyo Jaz, tell them how I left it
Ooooooohhhh
You got me saying things I don't understand
Ladies, if your man makes you say
(He made me speak different languages [backwards])
Ladies, if your man makes you say
(He made me speak different languages [backwards])
He is here to stay, he is here to stay
This is my plan, you my girl, I am your man
Take your pain, take my hand, take my name
It's not a game, don't be ashamed
If I'm the boss, the boss lady must be your name
So I have you, I have 212
Put your face on my back, new tattoo
20 years in the game, what love won't do
Many women love me but I love you
You look pretty when you smile, so renew our vows
It can happen to you
What caught me, shit I caught you
And start rapping about things like love and being honest
Now maybe we can make another baby or two
(He made me speak different languages [backwards])
You make me say (you have me speaking different languages [inverted]) [x2]
Ok, here in Cali
Smoking in this green that looks like Luigi
I have my Fiji, I'm going to take your girl to the water
It pretends to be a breeze!
Grassy yard, raking the dough
Still in my shit, who am I doing it for?
House in the hills with the lake in front '
The old ass nigga should take it slow
Nigga get up off my line
I'm back to basics
Tracing shit
PI. real with amazing saliva
So I'll never ever have to chase a bitch
Dig it up, and I came up with it
And your only hoe could get it, admit it
Locked, locked
Talk shit, get caught
Look, these are G's
And this is being a breeze
Yes music please
And my keys
And my trees
Yes
Dis finna be a breeze
Music please
And my trees
Imagine sitting on my throne alone
Solid as a rock, engraved in stone
Retriever, retriever
Catch the bone
Big dog baby
The rest are clones
Bass go boom with the baritone
Clarifying the shit like a claritone
Look me in the eye, I'm really impressed
Peoples is ready for me to rap
Don't sweat on set
Sprinter go to the jet
Dis finna be a breeze
Yes music please
And my keys
And my trees
Dis finna be a breeze
Yes
Dis finna be a breeze
Music please
And my keys
* cough *
You got me on my knees begging God please

Whatever you use

If you come to represent the dog, then you say Yes (Yes)
All you need is your dog collar! (With diamonds on the baby)
Whatever you use

It is not a lamp, it is a necklace.
And it's guaranteed to get you dollars
Make them wanna holla in this hole like an impala
It's Snoop Dogg and you know I'm the best dolla
Groovin 'and Movin', Provin 'once again
On the way, because yes, I have to win
Keep it all in the mud
And leave them confused
Losers like that
Life is hard as a brick or a twist
Through stress and struggle
But you have to be strong
I have muscle, hustle, as hard as you can, it's me
Man, I live my life like Puff-a-little
Go straight through
You better think it's right
But it's strong, and you can see
Even if you are not looking
You are weak, you cannot rap, there is no comparison
East Side's biggest outlaws
No glitches, no slips, pump your breaks, hit the puck
Get the potatoes, yeah
The new hundred look funny
It will still make you smoke
Is the drug
That makes a black man weak and sleep
And I can't cope with life on the streets
And that's real
So bow to Bow wow because he will come back with a new style
And it will make you holla
The top dollar
And all you need is your dog collar
We don't even care

Now i see what you see
But you probably don't believe
What I think, you have a trick up your sleeve
And I'm going to hit you with the hellish master plan
So please don't feel indecisive
Because you know that the dog collar is president, in its resident
And the message is
No money, no drink, no weed, everything you need
That will make your grandma want to holla
Diamonds in the bank, like an impala
And I wouldn't trade mine for a million dollars
Whatever you use
If you come to represent the dog, then you say Yes (Yes)
All you need is your dog collar! (With diamonds on the baby)
Whatever you use
We don't even care
If you come to represent the dog, then you say Yes (Yes)
All you need is your dog collar! (With diamonds on the baby)
It is not a problem that you cannot solve
Because I can do in the mix
It is not a problem that you cannot solve
Because I can do in the mix
Everyone will see
You're down with me
Just wait and see
Everyone will see
We will have a lot of fun together
Just wait and see

Snoop:
When I step on stage in my g-boy stance (what)
And say some rhymes that make your girl wanna dance
You're tripping over your girl because she showed me love
Nigga don't hit her, cause if you hit them, you don't need them
See how fast they take your freedom (what, uh-huh)
I believe them, and I don't mistreat them, I stay with them (what)
Because hey, you could rock to the beat you see (what)
But could you rock to the rhythm of me ... (uh-huh) I ... (uh-huh) I ...
But when you do your thang make sure to do it
By hanging, and everything is everything
Man I'm on this paper chase
Like them, Whiteboy D.A.'s was on the case (uh-huh)
But you know I'm not trying to floss but
The murder was murder, the case they lost
(Murda Murda Murda Murda)
Chorus
Now someone in the house remembers
When there was no Snoop Dogg? (Yes)
Am I bumping into all of you? (No way)
How we do it from the beginning (uh-huh)
Inside and outside the Hotel Boz, they say your family doesn't know me
Wait, buddy, that's fake, informal
Say, tell me, L is in jail, vest before the test
No one on my click fell (what)
Because we think of peeps, what they need
And it's not a party like this (say what)
Because you feel where we do hizzot
But I'm going back to the grizzats
Snoop D O double G returns for a remizzax
Chorus
If you know what I say?
(dogg, da-dogg dogg dogg dogg dogg) (fatha, fatha, fatha, fatha)
It's about gangstas, son

From V-A to L-A
Than
Da-dogg da-dogg fatha fatha
Uh huh
Uh huh
What what
Ain't shit like goin 'with my niggas, looking at the world time
It is nothing more than a thang for a young man
It would not be the same if the newspaper were not among us
I used to wonder what funk was
Bigg Homie said: 'Give them what they want because'
I don't remember getting high like a damn
Walking around without greeting the motherfuckers
Little mom told me, make no mistake, it's the truth, but I
I'd rather have a nigga like Soopafly
Believe me, I'm leaving everything
And niggas travel when they see me at Dogg House
And every time the Bigg Homie arrives they rush
Dogg House America {ooohhh}
Dogg House America {Dogg House America}
My home {my home}, sweet home {hoooommme}
Uh, get ready for the park and get moving
Mom said super-tech the funk, back shoes
The white groove, S dot A dot SHOES
A nigga like moos better not make that move
Unless you're rockin 'with Dogg's best house
Many hate it but at least they tied with heat
They make it fake tabloid, you froze
Thinking they can fuck with the cost of the city
They love to dance, uh
A tough chocolate chip cookie sauce
Wit the rockin this perch hit top wit with this hip-hop
And it doesn't stop (it doesn't stop)
I make a woman go crazy, I want to treat you lazy
And when I'm done with your bitch, I get like baby
And look it's not maybes, about the game that I pack
Name on tracks, supa dupa returned
Oh danger, niggas give me five minutes of fame
To show you why you should use all kane, take a look
Oh I, Oh I (oohh I), (oohh I)
Oh me, oh me (ooohhh wwoaahhhh)
You want funk
I can see it moving over your soul
On your soul (on your soul, yes)
We have that funk
We see g'up bumping wherever we go
It's the music that makes you feel in the rhythm (ooohhh claps)
Clap your hands and make your body move (woooaaahhhoo)
Uh, uh, we're here to listen, ride and slide
And we do it on the hip
Come and ride with this mothership from the Dogg House
The bone in my leg is connected to the bone in my knee.
And my hip bone is connected to my big bone, your house
That gang gang from Dogg House
Really makes you go
Really really really brains me to the brain
He really fights me to the brain (wooaah, wooaah, wooaah)
This goes to you and you
In each of the bells
Menacing, noooo
Don't plant your seeds in hollow soil
Is an elephant heavy?
Is the pig a pig?
And how did Snoop manage to keep the meat off his fork?
Talk to the people and the boss to the crazy
Steal from the wealthy so you can bankrupt
Open your years and pass me a beer and hit this here
Drink in the corner, we got a did in the game
Dogg House, motherfucker, we do the damn thing
And i am so cool
My sweet brand freedom
G for G
I'm the one who boogie woogie oogie
Dogg House you
Can you believe it
Uh, 2000 plus 2
Psychedelic
Oohwee
Something to dance
It's that new hypadelic
Padelic that ass, can you dig it?
Every time I'm depressed, I come back to myself
I roll a bloody fat bat for me
Leave him as a beaver, the United States will be legalized but I don't believe him
Until he finally did
All things under the letter G, Snoop Dogg did it
Gazing gracefully at the sky
Many people smoke just to survive
But I see things very differently.
Medically, physically, mentally, theoretically.
Put it in a letter for you to let it be
Someday we will all agree and have peace under a large chronic tree
And not having to answer to anyone
So we go because
So go ahead and shine
Today is the day to burn (Yes, yes, ooh)
So go ahead and put your J on top (and smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (getting high)
I burn soon when I wake up from my sleep
I hope they legalize it here, I'm tired of the police.
I'll still burn with you, shoot that ho
I even put it in my food, got a brownie recipe
You eat man in one piece, your ass will be fucked for six or seven hours or so
Don't you like groceries? So I have a lot of flowers to blow
Smoke it on paper, cigar, a bong
Don't worry about the haters, just vibrate with the song
And do it as you please, please
Today is the day to smoke weed
So go ahead and shine
Today is the day to burn (Yes, yes, ooh)
So go ahead and put your J on top (and smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (getting high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Damn, a pound is really nothing now
Remember to smoke with my cousin
Now we are all filled with raw cone
And you don't have to ask why we are important
I smoke like them old players
I recently started letting niggas smoke bluntly
Get a bad bitch, sit her down, let her smoke, now she opens up
The best trees I'm smoking
Smell through the bag to make it powerful
He ran on the stove, taught a young black man how to grow it
A pothead but I'm focused
And it's not in my session if it sucks
Only the best that you're dealing with
So go ahead and shine
Today is the day to burn (Yes, yes, ooh)
So go ahead and put your J on top (and smoke)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana (getting high)
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Go ahead and shine
Today is the day to burn
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana
Na-na-na-na-na-nanana na
Come and smoke with me tonight, tonight
Dog's house
Give me some of that G Goldie Loc shit
Yes that's what i'm talking about
Yeah look at this uh huh huh
We have Snoop Dogg in the house tonight, with the boy from the Tray-Deee household.
What do you say huh (We do this every day)
Did you get the humidity? Did you get the humidity?
VIP. status, you don't need a gadget
Cause niggas lame wit, all over cabbage
Toastin Remys, filling jimmies, we're all leaving
Got some bad bitches, I headed for the player's ball
Tray-Deee, Goldie half dead, twins light sacks
Bigger than big every day in L.A
4 Tay representing all the damn yes, Beeyotch
2nd HOOK: Snoop Dogg
DoggHouse, quit, and if you're not high, you have to get
Damn, that's in the O G D P, (say what)
No matter how you come, use all the angles
Ties tangle when the killer strangles
Better float like a national pager
We can actually deal with you who hate the beach
We hit the place, every city has a block
What you do when you take it to a different type of level that appears
Meet the dog, keep the rocks on your hip, steady beat
Firm Sangu Hoes From The Gang We Claim
Me, I'm Waniac, the maniac, Trip Loc, wouldn't you spit that rap out?
Park my shit and jump, I'm in the friends place
To see if it floated with me to the Dog House
Hello my people that I know in the complex
Now we are ready to roll, go to the store, then to the lane to share the ride.
Once again it's on, great chiefin
Ladies everywhere, and super tied niggas
How we like it, sink into my 5 0 1
Killing my lungs, keeping these friends and bitches in one
2X HOOK
Man, I have arrest warrants, bad taxes, I still say screw it up
Aimed at DoggHouse Swervin in a bucket
And I got my bitch to contact too
Swoopin 'on a little Soopafly, setting my smoke on fire
4 Tay's on the way plus twins are posted
Straight thieves pulling money out of books
Makin nothing but that gangsta shit that niggas love
Thuggin at the house party, fuck goin clubbin
2nd HOOK
Ice skating
I am faithful to the game, also, I go out looking for riches
I'm going to be up the road trying to pack my bags
I'm so down I'm ripping the back of my khaki pants
I'm trying to reach my dirty red dog
But this hoe won't let me know which way to go
I move slowly
My remotes only come with hundreds of miles walking
Hundreds of miles of runnin smell funny and I'm gunnin nigga
And we're going to party on this motherfucker all damn night
2X HOOK

10-20-71, the day I go out
Two days later, I'm running my mouth
Mom put a bottle on my grill
I look at her face and say calm
So she lays her back on a pillow, uh huh
Two minutes later, I'm rescuing the hoe
On the way to the liquor store
O-E fell because it's too cold
I get some gin and then I ride
But before I walk out the door
The man behind the counter says hello, me, me
He lifts me up and sits me on the seat.
And then he picked up the phone and called the police
I want to run but I still can't walk
I can't deal with anything, because I still can't speak
Cameras around me like I'm a star
Mom grabbed me, hugged me and kissed me
This fool tried to twist me, mom says he missed me (I missed you)
Regroup it, swoopin 'in the coupe and
That's what I'm going to call, because boy, you're snooping
Soon I'll be hoopin 'hoes, I'll be pulling
First piece of ass before I got my first whoopin '
Cook, reserve, connect with G's
Twenty days later I'm from R-T-C
Selling candy for a white boy from a light blue truck
And I'm coming, that's right, niggas running
Have fun and stuff
You niggas don't want any of us
What's up dude? (What's up cuz, where are you from)
My name is Snoop Dogg (Where are you from?)
East side, rolling twenty cryp (what)
(Oh) yes (OK, everything is fine because) That's what I'm talking about
(Yes) Ah, you're going to feel black sooner or later
(Called Snoop) bow wow (SNOOP!) Bow wow
Yes (SNOOP!) What's up (SNOOP!) What's going on?
Dogg shit (called Snoop), roll with me
Roll with me, S-N-double O-P
Mel-man where have you been O.G
Tell me, the game will never fail me
Ask J or my little friend Shelby
Uh, I cut them off like Marcus Welby
This is the best G, you will never see
There will never be another me
By the grace of God, you love me
Pause, do it to em 'dogg
Now drop a stone on them
Now put a lock on em 'dogg
Rolling down the river spinning on a log
Go to the liquor store, grab a thicker ho
Get me a Michelob, although now I want Snicker
Remind me of the old days
Family reunion ha ha ha 8 track style
Mel-Man you're a fool for this because
But I could kick a fat fat guy from known rap
Look, when you talk about all that, you know I like to appear
Look where I come from, so you know it's on
Because I brought these nuts, because I'm above the law
The Pound, Dr. Dre, we are equal to death row
Now you know about me
D to A to Z
S-N-double O-P, D-R-E
That nigga, Dr. Dre
So we say like every day
Kurupt is the name they call me
As a nigger makes bigger waves, I start flexing
When the niggas start to walk
Grab it with my Tec and Snoop, kick it
If you're wicked, wicked, I kick it
Slick and not with them condo hoes coochie, you won't lick it
It's like this
I don't eat them hoes because I'm so soft ...
Break the beat for me ..
Motherfucker Dr. Dre is on the piano
Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the voice and I swing like a soprano, anus
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg, it's on the microphone, you get it, I
When I'm growing up I'm flowing with the gangsta shit
I'm not flowing with that punk punk shit
And when I walk into the house, I'll hit you with the gangsta ... fat punch
Just don't give up like I told you
Let me have the microphone so I can slowly bend you
I told you, mold yourself, scold you like a little hot water
Heat it up, hit it, Snoop Dogg, you can't defeat it, erase it
I'm so smooth that I don't have to show you on the camera or on the TV screen
I'm funky like some kale
I told the peoples, my aftermath, they don't crash
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg, I'm with D-R-E, I see it's from Compton
And I'm from L la O la N la G
The B the E the A the C the H an '
And Cali is the state and
Because i'm not hating
yes man
Which of these cars will you use?
I could use the Celica, Mazda, Nissan or Toyota (what about that MR2?)
I heard they got that new PT Cruiser too
Tea that also has that [?] (Oh, what a surprise!)
Yes, what course are we going to use (I don't know)
Let's try the deep forest
I heard it was flying (yes it is)
3! two! one! Let's go!
Foot to pedal and pedal to floor
Hurry up and take off, adjust my seat
All right because I'm falling at this rate
Slipping, sliding, shattering
I'm taking the initiative while others crash the wall
Doggy D-O-double G in the (damn) Gran Turismo 3
The coldest game, doing thangs
I'm speeding up while changing lanes
Making an attempt of 100 to reach two
My friend in baby ('Bu), navy blue
Yes, that's it! sitting in firestone
I'm trying to bring another checkered flag home
It feels bad in the worst way when you're in last place But, sorry, I'm in first place
So how am I going to trip over that?
Because if I lose, I turn it off and come back
A completely new course, with tunnels and trees.
Thanks for your support
I couldn't have done it without you
I doubt you have ever seen such an amazing racing game
Pick it up when it's down and
I drive well when the beat beats
Hitting your whole face
In a completely different place, a completely different state
Sitting on Chrome, acting this bad
In the real deal
Live from the apricot hill
I'm in pursuit
Being chased by (hoes) that's too cute
Pulling out of my lane, drifting through the grass
Man, these cars are in my ...
Bumpers jump up to three hundred, very cold
I'm doing too much, I lost control
Should I stop or roll?
My mission is to position my post (position)
It's about winning! you know what happens
Playstation 2 takes you to a whole new dimension
Where the cars seem to fly and have good suspension
Did I mention it was tight though for real?
You're listening to the sounds of baby D-O-G
Riding sliding, sliding
(Damn) are you in second gear? put it third
And make sure you don't hit those white lines down the sidewalk
Your wit does in the Subaru
Oh lord, I jumped in a dark blue Ford
Any claim that he is in it to win it
Don't stumble, just make sure you'll finish first, second, third
That's all that matters and I doubt there is a fragile racing game
Although really Gran Turismo by sho although
Deep down, the game that is for you
Put your pedal on the metal
And ax all the kids in the ghetto
"Is the game hot, like the kettle?"
And I guarantee you all say, "Hello!?!"
Ride, ride, ride
Making two hundred
In the fast lane
Yes, what is the game called?
Gran Turismo for sho 'yo at the bottom
Better ask someone
Real me Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo
Can we have a damn moment of silence?
For the little chronic rest?
A-hah, niggas tease these hoes and this shit
Get the bitches out to eat and spend money on these hoes
You know what I'm saying?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have, I never will
I say to a bitch like this:
You will never go platinum! "
Hi Daz, give me a light black
I own this motherfucker and my name is Taa-Dow
You all niggas know who I am, all you niggas breaking shit
But we have something old and something new for you tonight
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
Dogg's Pound and the Fabulous Dramas
It's like everywhere lizzook
And wherever I go
I'm listening to motherfuckers trying to steal my flow
But it's nothing, because, look, my friend Coolio
Some of these niggas are so misleading.
Using my styles as a contraceptive
It seems that you have not learned
Hit them, pick them up, spit them out
Now tell me, what's going on?
It makes me want to scream, because my dollars come in zones OR
Known for breaking up so take off your clothes
And stop trying to spit on my damn hoes!
Speaking of hoes, I'll get to the point
Do you think you have the bomb because I made you roll a joint?
You are a flea, and I am the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my damn paws
And look where I come from: it's still Eastside
Until I die. Why ask why?
As the world keeps turning towards the D-O-double G, Y
It's a crazy and confusing world
It's a Doggy Dogg world
Well if you give me 10 bitches, I will fuck at 10
Spotted friend Snoop Doggy drinking juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm for the trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packaging flavor like life preservers
Isn't that something?
Talk shit and I'm pulling
I had your whole fucking block of punches
Don't sweat, but check the technique. I'm unique like china
You'll never find a bomber rim that's black behind you
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming
1, 2, 3: you can't see me
A fucking threat, using hoes as tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and exploding
All I see is green, so there's no stopping
I want to see some panties falling
(All I did was use that ho
Show him my dicks, keep on with these and kick flows)
Cut persimmons, French braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name is often marked to catch slugs
But it is mandatory that I kick it
Check it out, I'm running hoes at 94, now I gotta prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I stay and move
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm hunting heads
Peep, the slaughter of a verbal murderer
Murder with rhymes packing 'Tec-9' for some action
It's a crazy and confusing world
It's a Doggy Dogg world
Tha Dogg Pound shakes the party (all night)
Even when? (Until sunrise ')
And it doesn't stop, and it doesn't give up
For the Dogg Pound clique to drop the cavi dough
So take a seat and take your gin and juice and watch the flow
I turn around and serve hoes with a fat cock
Now I'm Daddy Mack, if I hadn't known
The city where I'm from: Dum diddy dum
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D
The gangster clique
Now that the Pound breaks down with gangster funk
It's a crazy and confusing world
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaa !!
(Here ye, here ye, come one comes all)
Somewhere it is, call it LBC
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaa !!
Somewhere it is, call it LBC
Now if you're tired of hard work
Tears and sweat
And you break your neck
Walking through the city, all tied up
Two hits no one left, breathless
Living in the city is a jungle
All this deception plus stress
You can't seem to go up, with your money to rent
And now your baby, mom, stumbling, wants fifty percent
It is a thin line, between yours and mine.
The difference is that you have to scratch to get nickel and ten cents
Now I know a place where
Maybe you want to be and I can take you there
Pop goes nine, we'll go right behind
You can take off your shoes, sit and lie down
(Here ye, here ye, come one comes all)
Somewhere it is, call it LBC
(I'm leaving with a baby)
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaa !!
Somewhere it is, call it LBC
Oh your friends think you're funny
Doing stick ups for money
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)
I've got your rocks so you keep 'em in the sack
You have two hits, but you hit again
You are all about your money and you have something to sell
But if you rescue a thief, you will return to the cell
Someone hated but baby without friends and
It was then that they beat you
Because you can't be out there doing it low
There are no rules when you're outside making dirt
There is always someone lying on the court to hurt you
But look, I know a place where
Maybe you want to be
And i can take you there
Pop goes nine, we'll go right behind
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaa !!
(Here ye, here ye, come one comes all)
Somewhere it is, call it LBC
(I'm leaving with a baby)
Somewhere it is, call it LBC
Somewhere it is, call it LBC
(I'm leaving with your baby)
Let me down on a little boy at home real quick
You know what I'm saying?
Stop life, it seems that we are in
It's time to stop your roll
Let Doggyland be your new home
Stopping the life you save may be yours
It's time to stop your roll
Let Doggyland be your new home
Doggyland is the city diz-owne goes to
(Is coming down)
Everything is free
And there is no HIV. (Than?)
And blacks don't kill each other
(Oh seriously, why is that?)
Because a brother is a brother
(And what about mothers?)
Heaven must be like this
Scent green like grass in summer
I'm smarter than the senator
Bigger than the mayor
It's like a prayer
And you can't enter without the gold card you have
Now you know a place where
You have to be and I took you there
Pop goes nine, we'll go right behind
(Here ye, here ye, come one comes all)
Come and go with me to Doggylaaaaaaaaaaaa !!
Somewhere it is, call it LBC
Yes, this is a story about a famous dog.
Doggy Dogg who is
That soft macadamia, also known as Silky Slim
Back in the damn house for nine days
Why should it be so?
Why would another dog hit him in the back?
It's in his nature, it's Doggystyle baby
Doggystyle, it's Doggystyle
(Oh, oh, me) Yeah, it's Doggystyle (oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh)
It is my first ass and it is very tight
But I can still run my business like a dog
So lay back, baby, and ride with me
I've got the drink on the deck so take a sip with me
Drip with me as I swing my thang
Remembering the first time Doggy Dogg arrived
Time to take you motherfuckers down memory lane
(Memory lane, memory lane, doggystyle)
(Down the memory lane, Doggystyle)
Oh, oh, oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh (yeah) me (yeah, doggy style)
It was a hot and sunny day in May.
I am next to the house with my friend J
Instead of being in school, I prefer to drop out and shit
Because at one forty-five I have a bitch
Working my thang for a bitch to be born
She glimpsing in the mirror and shit
Because once I'm in the back all I hear and shit is
(I can see)
I'll do things to take your socks off
(I can feel it)
Once you get closer the pussy clears up
Something for the bitches that's with me
Keep it low as you crawl and move with me
Don't be afraid like Aaron Hall
You know you want to fuck your black Doggy Dogg
Have you ever been licked and screwed up your pearl tongue?
While your nigga is in the county and you eat a dick
The position that I am fishing and wishing
Doggystyle is doing it, bitches blow
Oh me, oh me (oh yeah), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(Doggystyle, doing it Doggystyle) I (do it Doggystyle)
Oh me, oh me (oh let me feel it), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(I can see it, I can see it) I
Oh me, oh me, oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh
(Doggystyle) I (Doing it Doggystyle)
Oh, oh, oh-o-o-o-oh (doing it doggy style), uh oh oh-o-oh
Oh I, oh I (oh I want to feel it), oh-o-o-o-oh, uh oh oh-o-oh I
(Do it Doggystyle, I want to do it)
(doing it Doggystyle, I want to try it)
Snoop Doggy Dogg, won't you hit him from behind?
Doggystyle, Doggystyle
No, one-two, right?
Give me love, that pussy is coming
Snoop Doggy Dogg
I heard you do it, do it all the time
I heard you doing it, doing it Doggystyle
And with the dog
Yes
Giving them bitches what they want
Serving them hoes, but you don't love them
I will tell you a little more
That you're doing it, doing it, Doggystyle
Oh yeah
Baby
It's not, it's not, it's nothing more than a G-thang
Baby
Do it doggy style for the nine years old
Yes, doing it doggy style
Doing it, doing it, Doggystyle
Yes
Live studio noise
Yuh, ayo big Percy
Pour me a glass of that moet with a little orange juice.
Ayo, lil P
Tell the bitches to come sit next to me
Yes i have a story to tell
And after that mac, mac I bought my first Cadillac
7-duece, 6 seats with thangs pendants
You can hang up if you want but I don't think you can last
Last week on the beach, the great friend crashed
I didn't say too much, all I heard was explosions
Don't ask questions in this profession.
You have to watch the game at your discretion.
It's a cold game, my niggas stop guessing
Do the right thing because I'm not giving lessons
Smoking that stress has you stressed
Take that frown off your face and tuck your chest in
Unless you plan to stay
Cause I'm the wrong nigga to push or test
I'm a nigga on the east side and I just don't care
I could change the game, go and cut my hair
You niggas say that I'm back but I haven't gone anywhere (he's back)
Hell yeah I'm there
In a clandestine meeting of the clux clan, family affair
Standing on stage, about to do that there
I need to be the governor (yes you can)
I keep one dark, one light, one fat, one tight
I'm always looking for the right one
Chinese, Japanese, Lebanese on her knees
Shit, you know me, I'm going with any of these
Vietnamese, Philippines, choose a niece, your niece
And we will remain friends
Nah I'm still committed, forget it
Because I know that in the end you will fight again
Green eyes, blue eyes, me eyes
His eyes bring me the money, I'll just divide the pita
Throw it in the oven, take my time and bake it
It's amazing how they act when you get naked
I can not stand it
I just can't take it
I just can't pretend
I need paper and that's not a lie
Burn my mass of dough until I die
I say I can't bear it
I just can't pretend
I can not take it anymore
I need (mass) and that's not a lie
I burn that mass until I die
How sweet it sounds
From Meech-a-rooni
Inside the dog house
For 2000 plus 2
I mean, could you put a chocolate wrapper around that
And put a lighter at the end
Because that's all misty
I smell you Meech-a-rooni
Ugh
Alright give me my forests here we go
Not bad meaning bad but bad meaning good
Time flies by with the boomin 'system
I shoot my head, I jumped again but I missed them
So I kept shooting until I ran out of shots
Then I threw my gun at him and ran down the block
For a disguise, niggas on the east side are back
I didn't hear your new shit cause your niggas are crazy
I came to this party alone
But I won't go alone
Everyone comes, it's like a date
I'm so faithful to this shit, never new to this shit
Niggas don't make or break me
Because all I do is shine
Toast to the bang bang boogie
Today we are going to get very small
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Well well
Well i take care
You better get them starchild
That's the XO bottle
And this gangsta shit on your [Cerato], huh
1 small 2, small 3, small Gs
4 small, 5 small, 6 TC
Look at a nigga when I dive into the Es
7 little, 8 little, 9 little hoes
I want to kick it, I guess, get tickets to my shows
10-11 but a dozen in the rose
I gave that bitch to my cousin because he's hard on the nose
Hey, you know how the shit goes, make that bitch strike a pose
She belongs to the gang, so you know that bitch chose
So cold, make a nigga freeze, hoe, nigga, G's
Niggas don't make or break me
Because all I do is shine
Toast to the bang bang boogie
Crush grapes to drink fine wine
S to N, double O, P
Today we are going to get very small
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I did a lot of shit
But looking at it, young loc, cause I'm in some other shit
Intellectual, misdirectional
Correct yourself to avoid corrections.
Mental stability, validity
All you look at is not what it seems to be
Forcing you, selling you, I tell you this
Watching this shit explode is like hitting a bitch
I'm cold with it, rock roll with it, trick hoes with it
Nick Foles with that, get it, I'll be the backup, second in line
Look when I come in, you won't have more time
I'm free as a bird, C is the word, nigga, I did that, nigga
Never change my nigga let's get this shit back
True to this shit, never new to this shit
Because all I do is shine
Toast to the bang bang boogie
Crush grapes to drink fine wine
S to N, double O, P
Today we are going to get very small
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Bitches will be bitches when the Chevy breaks
Bitches will be bitches when the Chevy breaks
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting heavy
Bitches will be bitches when the Chevy breaks
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting heavy
It all goes back to '85
I remember one night after the Sugar Ray fight
She had a best friend with titties named Vanessa
She told me to undress her, yes sir
She was so vicious, her lips so delicious
Suck a nigga's dick and make it shine like some dishes
Patricia Patricia she loves the way I stick her
I take her to the movies and now she eats his cock
Large amounts of money, no whammies
She lived in the valley, she couldn't understand me
But she let me dig up, her friend named Brandi
Now Brandi was a nice thick bitch
She moved to the hood of 2-0-6
And the pearls and the girls in the neighborhood.
Hmm, and I saw that, so I watch the game
So I put her on, you little bitch on my team
And we start to makin, breaking takin bitches
Whatever we want, see what she wants with the fake
And break the bitch, yeah she's Jamaican
And let me hit it, listening to "One Love"
Of a little idiot chicken, I have more bitches
Now I'm fucking your sister, she's getting really suspicious
But the dick is good, so they won't say
And now, next door neighbor Clarissa Bell
She has been looking at me, I think she wants to hit
But I'm coming back, cause I'm in another bitch
He said, "Snoop Dogg, how could I fuck a bitch?
And make her suck a dick and not get caught in the shit?
I called and look here, this is what you do
Make the first lady sell a little pussy for you
I think he got it, because he went fast
Well what do you know, D-O-double-G
And I'm a young pimp, I have a lot of crops left
And you're a young ho with a lot of hoein left
Always keep a ho under control, explore a train wreck
Yes i might have to dig deeper
Look at every little ho I met
I shot him in the face and he said "Ahhh"
My homeboy charles
He got on his sister, behind the garage.
It was a threat, it was strange, it was sick
When they tried to hump, he was teaching them to suck cock
Always trying to get on a ho
They caught me trying to fuck at school, they asked me why I did it.
Do you know exactly what I said to him?
I love her pussy, and this cock is what I showed her
And now they kicked me out, now I'm on the platform
I'm in a new school, great
New hoes, new script, fresh fish
Come into the room and I'm looking for a new bitch
I'm in a new queue, I want to holla back
But for now let me holla back black impala
She is a 12th grade student in my science class.
And I've already seen the pussy, yeah boy, I'm moving fast
Could claim a lady or play with her brain
Or tame a man, not with the same old game
It's what I say and do to make the bitch give up
Now what are you going to do, when they ask you
Are you going to tell a lie, or are you going to keep it?
Or are you going to keep everything inside or are you going to tell me?
It's just another day in the Doggy Dogg neighborhood
You better watch your girl, cause if she's on the loose
Now what do you do?
Bitches will be bitches when the Chevy breaks
It's getting, it's getting heavy
Bitches will be bitches when the Chevy breaks
It's getting, it's getting heavy
{* fades *}
I am in high school with a grade of C +
At the end of the day I don't make it to the game room
I gotta tell these niggas every day not to shit
Because where I am, if you are soft, you lost
And to stay the course, you must roll hard
In front of his building with the rest of his friends.
I give her a pound, no I mean I shake her hand
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man.
I'm going upstairs, I hug my mother
I kiss my sister and I hit my brother
I sit in bed to watch television.
No that's the fourth time this week
Four young brothers were shot on the street
The next day while I go to class
My mom goes to work cold bustin 'her ass
I have three pants and I share with my brother
So there at school I played dumb
With a pair of pants and a half, you're not great
Because there are no dollars for anything else
Now every day I see my mom fighting
So now it's time to do something
I am looking for a job
I do odd jobs
And come home like a bum
So here comes Dogg, his gold is shaking
It gives me two hundred for quick delivery.
My mothers are nervous but she knows the deal
My sister's outfit now has sex appeal
My brothers, my partner and they were receiving paper
And three months later, the entire hood collected the vapors.
My family is happy and everything is new.
Now tell me what the hell am I supposed to do
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Oh me, check this out Snoop
All these niggas always talk
"They love this" And the niggas love you
O black, I love this ride or this chin around my neck, black
You niggas don't know what shitty love really means
Nigga, you can't buy love at any nigga corner store
Love is priceless
Snoop, I want you to pay this shit to those niggas
Hmm, the money flows, everything is fine
I bought my car and Uzi and my brother a nine
Business is booming everything is fine
A year passed and I started to grow
Not in height but juice and cash flow
I put my feet up to watch some television.
Because now I have other people working for me
I have a 55 "TV you know
And occasionally I hear "Just say no"
Or the other commercial that I love
That's when they say this is your brain on drugs
I lift the remote and just turn
Because with this shit I'm not worried
We drive again through our territory
I stop in the light like a superstar
I hit the gas pedal scared like shit
I drove a block to find my brother was beaten
I wasn't dead but the blood was shedding
And all I could think about was Warren
Later I found out it was Dogg and his crew.
Now tell me what the hell am I supposed to do
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Yeah so now you see what I'm talking about nigga
You see what that shit of love does to you
This nigga said he had love nigga and this nigga shot him brother
So what the fuck are you going to do now?
My brother is outside but I'm still inside
I can't believe Dogg put me off
That fagot that punk is soft or ladybug
I drive with three of my boys
The war is on and I'm on the rise
We arrived at Dogg's favorite place
What is breaking Dogg and letting the bullets hang
Someone shot, so we covered
Bustin shoots in hopes of hitting someone
So I stopped and fired three shots
Two hit that nigga and one hit a cop
I threw down the gun and started screaming
"Oh, we are all going out, I sank them down
Aim, shoot my four-man crew
Now tell me what the hell am I supposed to do
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Doggz will catch you
Love is a motherfucker
And Doggs is a motherfucker
Love will catch you
Naw nigga Doggz will catch you ever try to play with me and that's real
This is real
What's up baby can I take you?
I don't give a damn what your friends say
You don't stay with me, you're always out to play
You're so hard to find, it seems like you're shaking me
D.O.G., we feel alone
Look baby D.O.G. we feel alone
And calling on the phone is what you say
But sometimes you have to find time to get up
To get out and escape you feel me
Now all I want to do is stay real and be faithful
I'm trying to have something and keep you satisfied, but
Look, I'm a gangsta, I'm always a gangsta, you can't change me
Even though at night I could feel lonely, you heard me come to serve me
I would love to take you to the mall
That's what we are going to do
Now I put you in the background
But baby mom full of drama isn't it
D.A.Z. the dog also feels lonely
Now you knew that the dog was dangerous and you took it
You have good love
You hook me a good meal
But you still couldn't hook me
Let me stop lying, I'm trying to be too cool, shaking up the real
All my friends know that D.O.G. You can also feel lonely, that's real
I don't give a damn what your friends say
You're so hard to find, it seems like you're shaking me
D.O.G., we feel alone
I don't give a damn what your friends say
You don't stay with me, you're always out to play
You're so hard to find, it seems like you're shaking me
D.O.G., we feel alone
Hey look at this baby
I'm not even going to rap on this
I'm not, I'm not a very rapper
But look at this, I'm going to put this P.I. to you very small
I mean I have to get this money, I'm hanging here with my friends
We do what we do, we've been doing this
Before I know you, you know what I'm saying.
Times are tough, my friends are gone, I know I know you there for me
I know you want to do those things that
What a woman should do for a black man like me
I mean when I feel lonely I scream at you
You're going to be there for me
This is real
I don't give a damn what your friends say
You don't stay with me, you're always out to play
You're so hard to find, it seems like you're shaking me
D.O.G., we feel alone
I don't give a damn what your friends say
You don't stay with me, you're always out to play
You're so hard to find, it seems like you're shaking me
D.O.G., we feel alone
(Chorus)
Doh 'Doh' (Doh ')
My niggas and I smoke Doh 'Doh' (Doh 'Doh')
Smoke that Doh 'Doh'
Smoking in that Doh 'Doh' (Doh ')
We smoke that Doh 'Doh' (Doh ')
My niggas and I smoke Doh 'Doh' (Doh 'Doh')
Smoking in that Doh 'Doh' (Doggy Doh 'Doh')
(Snoop Dogg)
Yeah i'm about to flow again
And don't be afraid, he brought a couple of friends with me
Man forget it
From dawn to dusk to run with us
You must burst, curse and rampage, now
Wow, how now you
(Soopafly)
You niggas better be careful
Because Soopafly is the most anticipated black that is not talked about
Fucking all your representative
As the coast passed, the bitches shook
They only come from right to left
To that, if you call that shit, Soopa don't fuck
I am something else
With my bad self
The game is hot, but the breath is cold
(E. White)
You wear, you wear on the set and you don't walk around, shit
We roll dice, skip school every day
My niggas Sherm'd and tall as shit
Well, are you willing to ride or what? Fuck it!
I need some black heat, run and tell him
(Snoop Dogg)
Bang in any gang
This is how Chitty-bang
Get it man, rich gang from the 20s
Yeah we're getting gritty
If I am going to choose: you will lose
We are fucking your show, giving you the blues, I surf!
I tried to keep up and burned a fuse
Bitches know the deal because they know the rules, they get hurt
I keep them paired in two
If they don't have my money: bare ass without shoes, fees
Give me nothing but good news baby, right now
Don't bring me down
(Snoop Dogg)
Goldie Loc 'you got me stoned like a motherfucker
Big-Snoop, happy as a motherfucker
I do what I do, because I'm about to get that peanut butter
Help help
A no notta, for 'shotta' Harlem Globetrotter
I like to hide inside it, then I light
(E. White)
Check it out:
Shit, I've really been to jail (really?)
And I really sold drugs (really?)
And I really got a strike (really?)
But I mess with all of you niggas
Why the hell should I be patriotic?
Stop the war on the police so we can talk about it?
I probably can't stay the night
But that's fine with E. White
Cause I'm smoking in that Doh 'Doh'
(Chorus)
(Mr. Kane)
We smoke this pump for you ca-rum-pum-pum-pum
We roll this wet for you ca-rum-pum-pum-pum
No sticks, no stems, no seeds ca-rum-pum-pum-pum
We don't smoke anything but cron 'like rum-pum-pum-pum
(mumbling)
Doh 'rae me fah, so get the smoking shirt on that Doh'!
It's the way I can't help it when it comes to Mary-Jane.
It's the way it makes me feel when it comes in!
It comes in! In my mind!
(Inhales followed by cough)
* inhales *
You know that motherfuckers are behaving too much.
You know? This is real
Just like the baby here, she's doing too much
And he acts like his, but you know it's not
Say he's doing too much, yeah nigga, you're doing too much
And if that bitch hooked has the bar posted
Say she's doing too much, yeah baby you're doing too much
I gave my relatives the keys to my suburb
I said to them "Hit the side, slide and take the grass"
However, forget about that nigga (fuck that nigga)
Fuck that black me
But I can't forget him because he taught me everything I know
Oh no Joe, walking the wrong way
Niggas like that (what), they get things like they want (damn)
So pretend funk, doggonnit
Now loc, look at this situation
You smoked and can't be trusted, I can't kick it with wit
Niggas like you, they used to be in my crew
Damn, they don't do niggas like they used to
Now if you are doing for your family and you cannot bear it
Because you know these motherfuckers try to take advantage
And if your family broke up and he smoked drugs
And you need to catch a different hit
Say you're doing too much, yeah Joey, you're doing too much
Parlay, everyday DPG style parlay
We could throw a pool party once in a while
Now in fact, we're going to do one this weekend
Let's see how many hoes me and my black Rose can weed
I believe in sharin 'the cock
Also, I believe in comparing cock
Cause she loves the way I just hit the pussy
Not only knee-deep, it was totally deep
A black sock was blown off, a black took off
Ooh baby you're a weirdo
Put my friend in the game like a gangsta
Isn't that a trip? Now we're on a turn
And he gets his third hit without coming back
Let's say you're doing too much, yeah, homey, you're doing too much
I'm living in the hills, drinking wine with mills
I have an important paper type, I am not tripping over invoices (yet)
Show me some respect and accept my coldness
And don't mistake my kindness to say I'm dumb
Use this as a warning, cause I'm starting
To realize some niggas think I'm soft like Charmin
Excuse me, because I'm not mad when you double
But do I hate when fools mistake me for the spray?
Friends and family, chasing me like a repo
Eat, smoke, drown and then want me to drop a note
Calling stray nigga leading past months
And you can only take a cold shower
You pretended like you were making more moves than Simpson
But forehead, pressing buttons, making a nut but sinning
And when a nigga on your phone, running your bill
Trying to tell some hoodrat bitch how she feels
You know you're doing too much, yeah nigga you're doing too much
And when your baby mom cries because she needs some milk
And you heard that another nigga was on his tilt
This is real

Geah, uhh
It's nothing more than doing it, my nigga
Everything in the club, you know?
See you there, baby, working on that pole, making money
Because I have this new step that I want you to do
And let's see if you can achieve this
Yeah uhh uhh
Put your right foot in and your left foot out
Put your butt on my cock, that's what I'm talking about
Now shaaake, that's what I'm talking about
Do it do it do it do it (How you want to do it?)
Do it do it do it do it !! (How you want to do it?)
Don't play with it, let me go get it
Because I've been watching, picking up, waiting
I try to put my hands on it, I want to make you submerge
I want to make you drink; I want to make you flip so open it
Tip on tiptoe from the back, now see you there
You can bring a friend with a bitch, I really don't care
Just do it fast, I know you're happy
You should have seen all the hooks I had on my face
Speaking of "I can rap, you need to sign me up because"
Don't you know I'm at the club trying to find some girls?
I don't give a shit if you can rap nigga they'll shoot you
I'm not fucking with wack wack niggas, so kick rocks
Ay baby boo, come and holla to my crew
And bring your friend too, now make her do what she does
Pick up your money, now strike a pose for me
Freeze (throw!) Mm, take your clothes off for me
Mm ... you stand there looking good
.. I see you trapped in the neighborhood
.. And I can say that the taste is good
You are a hustler, a real flame spitter
Twenty two hoes and they all came with her
She needs a dog in her life and D-O-dub bit her
She is so anxious that the baby had to stay
Don't even stumble because now you're shooting with a player
And let's do it, until you have enough
I'll get you drunk, I'll take you home and then I'll hit him
I'll leave you, pick it up, I need your hair fixed
So I can take it, fuck you, you know what happens

Balls licked up and down

Bust ass, HIV pussy ass motherfuckers
I me I Daz, easy, easy * Shooting *
We would like to welcome you to fabulous Carolina West
But we have something old and something new for all of you
Put your hands together for Snoop Doggy Dogg
It's like wherever I look, and wherever I go
But it's nothing because I see my black Coolio
Put me in the game when I go through the doing '
You know, some of these niggas are so tricky.
I hope you burn, it seems you have not learned
It's the Nick Nack Patty Wack, I still have the biggest sack
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back (why?)
Hit 'em, pick' em up, spit them out, now
Tell me what's going on
Solitaire for breakup, so take off your clothes
And stop trying to spit my mother out with hoes
Seakin of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb because I made you roll a joint
I'll rip your balls off with my mother's paws
You niggas better recognize
Why ask why? As the world continues to spin towards the D-O-Double-G-Y
It's a crazy mixed world, it's a Doggy Dogg world
It's a Doggy Dogg world, it's a Doggy Dogg world
The world of the dogg
Well if you give me ten bitches then I'll fuck all ten
Look at my homey Snoop Doggy drinking juice and gin
Don't slip, I'm here to take a trip, to get papers
Styles vary, packing flavor like Life Savors
Ain't that something, talk shit and I'm overturned
I had all your damn bumpin block
You'll never find the bomb-to-branch, so this nigga behind you
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm coming
One-two, three, you can't see me
I'm a G like that tied up with tough tactics
A damn threat, they use hoes as tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin
All I see is green, so there's no stopping
(All I did was use that hoe
Show him my dicks, keep on with these and kick flows)
I'm handing out blues, I'm pissed off like bad news
Cut persimmons, French braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name is often marked to catch slugs
And I smoke weed for her shit
Ruff and tough shit, it's not explanatory how I get mean
But it is mandatory that I kick it
Check it out, I'm running hoes at 94, now I gotta prove it
Prepare for a war, it's on, I'm hunting heads
Press the button and the light turns on like Red Dawn
Peep, the masicre of a verbal murderer
Murder with rhymes packing Tec-9 for some action
You can't make me, I'm going to go crazy like O-Dog
Tha Dogg Pound shakes the party (all night)
Say when (until dawn)
Diggity Daz out of the motherf ** kin cut once more
I turn around and serve hoes with a fat cock
Until I die, I keep screaming that (bitches ain't shit)
Now I'm Mack's dad, if he hadn't known
The city where I'm from, dum diddy dum
As you move through the gangster shit
The D-O-Double-G the P-O-U-N-D, the gangsta clique
I can see and I can say that's what you want
So I turn on the chronic, so I can get high
Yo dogg, niggas always ask me
Niggas gon ask me
We're not going anywhere nigga
And in fact, you're acting like a fool right now with all that shit you kick
Nigga wherever I go, niggas be dumb
I'm a pilot, the first local stock pilot
I move to block D, me and my friends
Pound Dogg would move abroad, immense degrees
Ain't no bitches niggas in the circle
I said to myself, be careful with my family and my health
Knowing that the rules have chosen to hang out with fools and fools
Pruning Dada from the old school I knew from back to school
Shitty attitude, kept it raw and gritty
Uncut, my kids and I fucked it up
What happens
Fucked up, fucked up for life nigga, Dogg Pound, you already heard
If I hear another nigga talk about what he'll do, who
Now how the hell do you think we weren't coming back?
D, P, G to C
Westcoast is the best and I'm a jerk
You see niggas rap, but they say nothing
Nigga, shut your mouth, put your dick down
Chorus
Don't be silly x2
Hook
You see you don't want to fuck with us
Knowing how we throw it out, sucka niggas wanna imitate us
Yes, worry about your crew of punk ass muthafuckin
And we keep it gangsta dumb, that's gangsta, keep it gangsta dumb
Travel, we got more mass than rock, more niggas to lock up
Look why this world we live in is crazy, and the people who are so sick
And when it comes to playing with guns, hell yeah we're the fastest biach
And oh my mom and dad, grandpa and grandma
Homeboy, you can't fuck with this
Smooth when we arrive
The DP when we go through the gangstas is in the house
And all of you muthafuckin niggas and you muthafuckin bitches
Get a fucking dick in your mouth
I'm a gangsta I thought you knew, G'd, gray and blue
Dive into the chicken coop, it made you blue
We are gangstas nigga, relaxed thinking I tell you how it is in the neighborhood
Where all my friends, you strap on Cadillacs
Hittin changes like every day, living like G style like every day, DPG-C
Hook
Choir x4
Only fucking man this guy did told me Dogg's pound broke
Wait till you catch that nigga, I'm a hit to him
Dogg Pound is never going to break up because that's the favorite group
They'll keep coming out with albums
Wait till I catch this nigga he lied to me
Wait till I catch that motherfucker
Shit man, don't be silly
Don't be silly, nigga
Don't be silly black, don't be silly black
I don't want anyone to screw me on these streets, kids.
I don't want anyone to screw me on these streets, because
Nobody has time for that
No one got it, no one got it
Nobody has time for that
Real shitty mane, no matter where you're from
I don't hang on my hood but I hit my hood, I'm affiliated
I grew up from the territory, I love working, I am affiliated
See I don't hang on my hood but I hit my hood
All I hit is that shit, stumble on this
Put the hammer on your bisquick in your biscuit
Jam with gelatin selling grams on TV
If you really want it, come find it on Dinnub
20 gangs for life, all my niggas locked up
It's a new game, it's a new day
We even have friends in Akron and OK-C
And I can't stop and I won't stop
I don't hang on my hood but I hit my hood, I'm affiliated
See I'm real to my niggas, I kill for my niggas, I'm affiliated
I grew up from the territory, I love working, I am affiliated
See I don't hang on my hood but I hit my hood I'm affiliated
Shit
Get up, get out, put the hood on, sit down
It's me, him, King, NFZ, so my throne, a no-fly zone
To make sure the check is mailed, fly down LAX
To see my great cousin, fuck everyone thought this shit was
Turn a couple corners, great friends will stop you
Because the money says where the stand is
Go show the motherfuckers where the truth is
Wait cause I do this, been to face to face
Straight shit G, 7 mile nigga with the clique 21 east
I love my neighbors, seasonal floor seats Pistons and Lakers
I don't hang on my hood but I hit my hood, I'm affiliated
See I'm real to my niggas, I kill for my niggas, I'm affiliated
I grew up from the territory, I love working, I am affiliated
See I don't hang on my hood but I hit my hood I'm affiliated
State to state, oh

See I don't hang on my hood but I hit my hood I'm affiliated
Yes
Do not do it
Fell at a party in the cpt
Niggas looking at me strange
But i'm in the game
Shit, I feel the same as all of you
Nigga, sentenced to death (ha ha)
I cut them loose, I send them juice
With visin in your glass
Catch them, all my friends get stuck
It is the story of a whale locked in a cell.
In the streets he was hot because he had important mail
Hanging out in the studio, splurging and thangs
Nigga f ** king of money, saving them hoes
And I bought some white muffins
Living in wilshire in a penthouse suite
F ** king bad bitches seven days a week
Colder than a motherfucker but now I'm hot
I guess now I'm playing
Falling money
I can hear them movie star bitches calling me now
Doggy dogg come and get with pg
Mr. Calvin Broadus, could you come see me?
But I'm not stumbling, I'm just a pound doggy
Talking big shit and on a bulletproof dive
Make my own beats, so f ** k you guys too
And I'm down with the niggas you know who
We got to the point
Blaze the joint
Come into the party and holla everyone
While the gin is mixed with the juice
And all five in the fucking game are gonna hit Deuce
Shit niggas gonna be niggas so nigga, nigga what
Just because I have paper doesn't mean f ** k
I was in the same situation as you once
Thinking to myself "damn, should I kill why?"
Two mistakes are not right
And it started from a fist fight
I only have one life to live
I am trying to see a grandfather with some grandchildren.
Do you dig
I'm trying to live a lot like my hair
Leave the shit, like Fred Estaire
I want to share my world
But how the hell can I share it?
You look at mine and you compare it
Man it's a shame
Is trying to come up with something new
Beating for you
So whatever you do, like it or not
Because when your shit plays
My grandfather once sat me on his lap and said
"son get your money like this" (get your money, man)
I feel alone in the area
Stone face
Live the life of al capone
A don corleone
Casually casualties, deaths
And all kinds of funny looking niggas coming after me
Fun, got me dodging, dipping, slipping and sliding
Eastside up, eastsiders because we ride (eastside up)
I fuck it up, like I always do
And that's a trick
I'm saying some shit
See, it's an everyday thang
Communicating with the slang of the pound dogg
We go back in the house and we just don't stop
Call your mom, f ** k her fat, call the mother ** real police
Uh uh
Don't fight the feeling
Hey, let me see a little more.
Shake (Shake, shake, shake, shake), shake your loot
You know we move, we move
We smoke, we drink
We dive, we turn
We bow, we talk
We walk, we bounce
Bustin ', we argue
Great thanks i got the good game

Homies, snitches
Pimps, killas, big bitches

Mackin ', smoking and slapping
Talkin ', rappin', get up in this action
Hoes slap each other, Betta bitch
I'm that nigger so as not to screw the wit, I won't make an investment of money
Give it to Poppy, go back and work that body
Do all the classes and don't be careless
Traveling, driving
Niggas try to fuck, we put them in stiches (Bitch)
It doesn't get any better than this, I didn't get wet, no Kris
When I'm in a whip, man, I burn the rubber
A girl tried to burst my rubber (what?)
But once I shot my lover, I exploited my lover
I promised madness, I said I forgot that I love her
So come see me if you buy brotha
I have weight now, I had too many blocks to cover
Other than that, don't ask me anything about the Cordillera Blanca (Why?)
Because it's not in your price range (Oh)
Chains of ice, nice thangs, so I rhyme (Rhyme)
I have money, if I'm late girl, save time
Coca-Cola, crack, drug, slap, all of the above
Without athletes, professional blacks, we all have our thugs
Roll up, wait, all you get is slugs
You know we move, we move
We dive, we turn
We bow, we talk
We walk, we bounce
Great thanks i got the good game
Homies, snitches
Pimps, killas, big bitches
Fakas, cake bakas, L.A. Lakas
I only fuck with real niggas, money makas, and you dig
Well what would this be without a lady?
That looks good and it goes crazy (crazy) (crazy)
Come on Lady May, say, say what sizzay (Yes)
Have bitches, say I'm rich, crazy, rich (Whoa)
Black Sixes sails with sack figures
I write traveler's checks and Amex cards
Fuck it, spend mass like a hip hop star
Big houses, French poodle, fish tanks with my baracudas (Baracudas)
Canopy bed, well I'm a mova
Goose pillow, double deuce, spotless
Strike a pose, woah (Woah)
I want ten, nigga, I'm a dozen
Move, move on the floor
We can give you
Oh all the funk you want
Hey (Oh, ew-ew-ew-ew), let me see you
Shake (Shake, shake, shake, shake), shake your loot
Do make me lose control
All the stars
Gotta shout out to my main man Cam'Ron falling down here
Lady may
And I'm the Bigg Snoopy D-O-double sizzle
Fo 'shizzle
Uh uh uh uh
I'm the coldest of the coldest, the coldest of all
The softest of the softest and the softest of the softest
The whole world is ready for this new joint that I just put together
Playing around with a bunch of thug niggas, drug dealers
Fools project, C-Murder passes them tools
Shit, I'm about to make these motherfuckers get up
I draw the line between yours and the mines and make sure they don't light you up
Hit the fucking set when I dive
(Where are you from?)
Dogg Pound motherfucker Gangsta Crip
Split wigs to live, everyday Thanksgiving
The tank is driven by Colonel Mr. Master P
Lil 'Silkky, Mystikal, C, and me and Fiend
Nigga, don't trip, cause we got my little friend in the cut
That's the black Soulja Slim, known for diving, what's up?
(Do not let him go)
We love to hit
And the rap game is like the drug game
The moment you forget it, forget it, bite it
But those niggas know when you're not with it
That's when they become ignant
(Do not let him go)
Life will twist you like a twist, you will twist with this
It looks like it's on, but it's off, I keep losing and shit
Staring dead at the chips, I blink, they dive
Life will twist you like a twist, you will twist with this
It looks like it's on, but it's off, I keep losing and shit
I'm stoned but I try to stay focused with my eyes wide open
(Do not let him go) ...
Look at this man -
I'm the hardest of the hardest, the truest of the truest
Look, but I'm not fucking with anything but G's, ballers and killers
So forgive my expression G
And you can't blame one of my niggas for that
Shit, we're just a bunch of thug niggas, ex-drug dealers
The kind of gangsta niggas your bitch loves niggas
But don't do that to yourself because I tell you
I love to connect niggas with niggas niggas
Now if your bitch is offline
And if you think about moving to Doggy Dogg, you better take your time
And you don't even know it, because nobody told him that
I just need to show you that
I don't know why all these bitches are fucking with me
Fuck all my enemies, I'm chasing cheese with G
Serving tapes and compact discs for all three and Ki
Nigga Biggie was big and 2Pac was too real
Now how the hell did that happen? I thought those niggas were rapping
But in this real world, shit, murder keeps breaking
Never leave home without her, shit, why dogg?
Real violence aside, just don't forget
Life will twist you like a twist, you will twist with this
Staring dead at the chips, I blink, they dive
Life will twist you like a twist, you will twist with this
It looks like it's on, but it's off, I keep losing and shit
I'm stoned but I try to stay focused with my eyes wide open
It looks dead on the chips, I blink, they dive, it's hard to hold on
(Do not let him go) ...
(Do not let him go) ...
(Do not let him go) ...
Ha ha, yes, uhh .. THX, uh, uh
I want to go universal once man
I wanna talk to everyone man
Cause I know niggas
I know niggas feel this shit man, anywhere man
No matter where you are, you have to feel this because
If you see the police, don't stop!
You're hot in the seat, don't stop!
My black ball until you fall, don't stop!
And break a bitch like a law, don't stop!
My nigga get cash, don't stop!
Oh, do you keep the stash on the board? Do not stop!
Oh you like to scrape and crawl? Do not stop!
Well, we do it without interruption, don't stop!
Yeah it's alright yeah don't stop don't give up
Don't you want to be dropped? Don't explode a shit
I'm saying niggas now, over the top, really spit
Whether we like it or not, we have to deal with
Geah - we are at your service
You're in the War Zone now, so don't be nervous
Everybody fall shit from the bottom up
Uhh, they want me to stop because lately I've been hard on them
And I feel my right hand raise saying, "Son of a bitch, don't make me
Slap you for not bringing the cash back
One of you niggas gonna feel these bullets
Six guns, loaded, hammer and pull
West gang nigga, I don't have to explain
Come on hit
If you have to throw a few rounds (don't stop!)
If some punk clown makes you fall (don't stop!)
If you don't come from the city (don't stop!)
If the neighborhood is where you hang (don't stop!)
If bustin shots is what you're doing (don't stop!)
Geah
Look, what do you want to do with my nigga?
Are you talking about I've been through my nigga?
I am original, busta, I am a D.P.G
War Zone motherfucker in the middle of the streets (nigga)
Geah, you get it and you go
Compton, don't stop for fools
I will not stop learning it, I have to eat boss
Now get in my way, I'm snatching you with your little underpants
Now rock twice and hold your hand like this
If not then stop representing this gangsta shit
So we hit the clip, the main point West G
Compton, Long Beach, S.E. Watts
Where the niggas are sicker, dumber, more missing
Trick, you know where I'm from, the War Zone
Don't stop, don't stop!
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop!
Damn I still hear my mom's voice
"Snoopy, get your butt up and go outside to play!"
Ha, if she knew what was about to start
Explosion!
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop at all
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop being you, don't stop being G
Egotistical, mystical, officially
Mix my feet to the beat with my warmth in the hideout
G in the bag with the C on the flag
We are real baby OGs
I received money daily in the 80s
Niggas like me never give up
And I'm still hard on a bitch, bitch
You have to tell them what it is, don't play the game
I love it when you call a bitch by name
Don't you dare try to save that ho
I know you like it but you can't be his wife
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop at all
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop being real, don't stop that rap
Be sure to show friends how to shake that trap
I mean I've seen a lot but I'm still in touch with it
I don't stop because I know they're going to fuck it up
We keep moving forward with this
Niggas didn't do the shit
We go in and peel your bitch so fast
80's with a bag of drugs in hand
For the 90s with a DJ and a microphone stand
I can't stop now, I'm too steep
Tech savvy with this cavy, come too deep
Dawg short, Snoop Dogg, this for all my dogs
Those who are real in the streets, those who are locked in the corridors.
Hall of fame with this game, legendary for all of you
Another 100 point game, now you can bury the ball
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop at all
Don't stop turning on the shit I spit
Don't stop, don't stop, this is all I know
From the rock to the rock in the bowl
Don't stop, fuck a policeman for all the times I was kidnapped
I move with real weight, I mean hundreds of thousands
Hundreds of pounds, green leaves.
I managed to get out of the damn streets
And I still go back and touch the youth
I teach them how to play ball and I teach them how to shoot
In pursuit of my dreams, while recruiting my team
Show them how to get to the top like cream
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop at all
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop at all
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop don't stop
Don't stop at all
What are you doing?
Oh seriously look at this
Nigga fittin to drop by
Yes
Girl, boy, that's the way of the world
You say he won't come back, shit, I hope he won't come back
And find me on the hot spot and work that skirt
You know the blue, the new girl, you know the truth hurts
The heart beats while I'm cheating, trying to catch a nut
Bad bitch got a nigga trapped
I have a black out of bounds in West L.A
I'm trying to find your grandmother's house, it's your aunt's house
Well you know we're a little burned
You know I turn it off when I'm in the mix
If I hit this pussy, you will tell me
(Do not tell)
When I get this pussy you will tell me
(I will not say)
If I hit this pussy you can't tell me
(Don't say, don't say, don't say)
When I get this pussy you will tell me
(Do not tell)
(I will not say)
When I get this pussy you will tell me
(Don't say, don't say, won't say)
I met this thang named Juanika
He stayed in Ingelwood and knew Tamika.
Tamika and Juanika were tight as gloves
I saw them tuesday night hanging in the club
I say what's up Tamika boo, what's up with you
Said Mauseburg skandelous, nigga, so fuck you
Some bitches will be liars (the lie), most bitches will be tryin (tryin)
G'd, boot, to hit and show
Windows tinted because everyone knows me
You said to Mause, you said to Snoop
Put me on the line, your friend
It was so much fun, hm, remember what you told me
If I hit this pussy, you will tell me
(Do not tell)
(I will not say)
If I hit this pussy you can't tell me
When I get this pussy you will tell me
If I hit this pussy you can't tell me
When I get this pussy you will tell me
(Don't say, don't say, won't say)
No baby, I'm not with the shit
I've been fucking around with you for two weeks and haven't seen an increase in cash flow
You've been running through your mouth, telling your girls how I'm fucking you
What I have in my house, the things I don't do for you
You better be careful because your girls want to come too
I got the beat back on Keisha, now I'm on you
And did you tell Tamika?
You are a cold thang, I told you to keep it on the DL
And if I decide to hit him again, he's at the motel
Work at my table and how to support my clientele
Damn it hit the spot
As pretty as you there are no more blessings for your jogging
But it could for the sake of my blow
If I hit this pussy, you will tell me
(Do not tell)
When I get this pussy you will tell me
(I will not say)
If I hit this pussy you can't tell me
(It won't say, don't say, don't say)
(Do not tell)
If I hit this pussy you can't tell me
(I will not say)
When I get this pussy you will tell me
(Don't say, don't say, won't say)
Not a big deal until it squeals
Now I gotta keep my damn woman close to that ho
Take a fucking rubber wherever I go
Keep her away from her family because her cousin knows it
She says she's fucking Nate but can't prove it
Next time you can't come if you have a strong tongue
This time you act like a nigga who just committed a crime
They broke your ass now that you face time
The money is in the package, it's on the driver's side
But nigga you were with it so when you shut up
Although this story is a fairy tail
Act like you that bitch nigga and please don't say
If I hit this pussy, you will tell me
(Do not tell)
(I will not say)
If I hit this pussy you can't tell me
(Don't say, don't say, don't say)
When I get this pussy you will tell me
(Do not tell)
If I hit this pussy you can't tell me
(I will not say)
When I get this pussy you will tell me
(Don't say, don't say, won't say)
If I hit this pussy, you will tell me
(Do not tell)
When I get this pussy you will tell me
(I will not say)
If I hit this pussy you can't tell me
I want to thank me for never quitting
I want to thank me for always believing
I want to thank me, oh yes I do
Oh i want to thank me for believing in me
And I want to thank me for never quitting
I want to thank me for doing more good than harm
I want to thank, I want to thank me
Oh I want to thank me for not having days off
I want to thank me for never quitting
I want to thank me, I just want to thank me
Tryna double tap that
Yes shawty
Tryna double tap that
Yes shawty
I'm trying to double tap that
Slide on your DM, slide on your DM
If she's not a rider, I don't want her
I need a real one in my corner
She got a job, she is independent
She doesn't need anything from a man
Shawty is making his own money
All your real paychecks, no stunts
She says she's single on the 'gram
Hello ladies
Tryna double tap that
Yes shawty
I'm trying to double tap that
Slide on your DM, slide on your DM
Oh shawty
Tryna double tap that
I'm trying to double tap that
Slide on your DM, slide on your DM
Which one of you will want to dive with a Crip?
Take a trip to a place where the weather wins
Going up a seven and
Hen and gin with a little medicine
This shit so heavy
Play twice with the rap, baby, so smart
Backyard, big house
Three or four cars, but she needs a little D in her life
Y G in your life
So I hit her with the business
Finzel, can a black man get a witness?
I'll put the jet in bed to get you wet
Fuck me on the bass and I'll lift you up
The best crip niggas, baby, us
Yes shawty
I'm trying to double tap that
Slide on your DM, slide on your DM
Oh shawty
Tryna double tap that
Yes shawty
Slide on your DM, slide on your DM
Rappers want to be athletes, and athletes want to be rappers
We all have our reverses, we are all factors
Executive, starvation or party suites boil gumbo pots
She wants to be handcuffed and pampered, pacified
Hey ... what is she? She ready
I'm trying to get some blowjob Betty
Man, I have Coochie on deck all day
Where the girl thicker than the Milky Way
I gave her my phone, she blocked her IG on my Samsung
However, bi-coastal, not local, we are popular for 'sho' sho '
We move like a circle, or should I probably say oval?
She drives a Volvo, a four-door, Snapchat wants a picture
She wants to give me fellatio, bruh, a.k.a. oral
Let me touch that, BIATCH!
Tryna double tap that
Yes shawty
I'm trying to double tap that
Slide on your DM, slide on your DM
Oh shawty
Tryna double tap that
Yes shawty
Slide on your DM, slide on your DM

Bitch fucking with an adult man
How did I finish I waxed you in your house
And then he buried you in your own land
Look, the police are afraid to come looking for me
But I don't blame them because they know
Got a bunch of thug niggas with me
Looking for trouble, starting shit
I'm riding alone and I'm busting and getting rid of your cock
Look, your children are not fighting
When you fuck with niggas it will definitely give you inner sleep

Well where I'm from we like to ride on enemies
Do it from the shoulders or from the tools
I do my dirt for my loneliness (for my loneliness)
C-Murder and Magic, hell yeah, my damn friends
And niggas wanna act the way they wanna get with Snoop Doggy
Shit, fuck what you're going through and fuck what you stand for
I have great thangs, you know what I mean?
Great riches is a blessing
You know I'm from a gang, aren't you a man?
I'm not afraid to let my nuts hang, isn't it man?
And smoke a lot Mary Jane, isn't he a man?
And he had never been in love before, was he a man?
You know I'm doing great things, don't you man?
Turn a swisha darling and foul that bitch
Let's get wild
Let's get high
Come on let's take some hits
Have a drink, count your bank or do what you feel
Pop the top on your lacker, is it a Snoopy deal?
It has to be a monopoly, this is how I play in this field
A quarterback with the sack, I have a team to build
A dream to fill, scheme for mills, wheels and offers
Do what I feel, I don't give a shit what I feel
And that's real
Pimpin 'ain't easy, for sheezy, my neezy, slap your breeze
And remember this nigga when you see me
You know I'm doing great things, don't you man?
You know I'm from a gang, aren't you a man?
I'm not afraid to let my nuts hang, isn't it man?
And I smoke a lot Mary Jane, isn't he a man?
I'm not thinking about a pay cut, this rhythm is a paper pursuer
You work from 9 to 5, but I will maintain a constant hustle
Yeah we're doing great things, a nigga has to have some muscle
Always keep it low, keepa is not afraid to snuggle
I'm only here to kick the game, get on the mic, spit flames
Big Snoop Dog with Kokane, not a man
Catch me looking fragile, I ended up connected to the boss and
Where you got your push part from is not my fault
I'm handsome enough without the clothes and the [?]
But I'm rude, I'm in command of all those hoes, I think I'm a star
I hurry up and call it what I see, I can't sleep
I need some money, stressed out, I'm about to fight
Bite that grass or something
Making it happen is the mission they send me to get wit
Not everyone falls dawg house, I represent this
Vision 88 kilos of cocaine hit in the face
Street value that's what you dream of doing
Running an illegal business, scammer
Smuggling, doing things with a gun, is what they fear
Bodyguards and hitmen like shit from Al Capone
Heavy artillery got the police on my cock
The rapists and the prawns run to the top
Murder is an everyday thing in the city
Where you have to trace tiles, assault rounds and make your
Tanadian Nay, the weapon manager
Hit from the verandas and do something unexpected
So we planned a plot with a Uzi and 10 shots
Pick 'em up until they all fall, spin around the block
Let them have it as soon as they come out
Along the streets of Long Beach
The streets were infected with drugs, drug addicts and addicts.
Juvenile behavior is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse, as law enforcement officials
They have tried to stop drug trafficking.
To come to our country, but they cannot
Murders have increased more than 95% and the amount of drugs.
I had no choice or remorse for time to leave
Niggas know the scoop is stupid if they come from my town
Young thief holding the hook, black, shaking the place
Seek help, you help yourself because there is no brochure
Since the city of Long Beach is just G's and hoes
Trust, bust, be aware and I'm not a curse
'Cause the niggas I dared to (? Agank?) The first
I think I could have passed away before reaching my vocation
As long as I'm carrying my heat, I'm stagnant
I bring you hard from the streets of life
Where niggas are rewarded for the pain of strikes
And the history of war is not worth risking
Real niggas still get a mob for respect
If you represent your set, until you bite down on the deck
Who I am? I'm the Dee, nigga check the file
Under G you will see not sweat my style
I come through the blast, I eat a downtown killer
Mashin, may they rest in peace in their coffins
Shoot them in front of Hassans
I should have known from the door, who's the baddest?
For the murder of forty men
From U-S-C, I change Ki, a plane of 120 trips
Multiplied by G, 87.3 million in a matter of months
Big business and big dollars is all I want
I'm on fire to celebrate, new empire to make
Toast until we all die, until we explode and break
From knives to pistols, from the wealthy to the slums
We ran out of drugs, I don't think so son
From daylight to darkness and all clucks to'spark
Since when do I pick them up like darts
Stab them in their hearts
Make an example, what I said, you end up dead
Spayed the wall with graffiti like pigs for all my lost Doggs
Never reach until I see the blue sky until I die
All I always want is to be alone
Myself, my drug, me and my chrome
I got paid by police and judges, I moved when it buzzed
Nerd
Nerd
You like i do
You like i do
You stay on my phone, talking about "What's wrong?"
I said, "Bitch, I'm home, there's nothing to break"
I just wanna fuck with you when a nigga needs some head
I'm not in love with you, bitch, I'm not lying in your bed
You're so annoying, bitch, you make me nervous
Ask where I'm going, bitch, that's not your concern
I let a bitch slide for a minute, but I'm back in this pimping
That's why I love you the way I do (all the time)
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
All they want to do is suck cock
That's why I love you like I do (Ooh yeah)
I just want hoes that can grab
See you at the club (VIP), I had a bad meeting of bitches
I said girl let's go (girl let's go) bitch let's do a little three
But you just started bumping into a player
(Bitch doesn't want to have fun)
Now you go back to where you started
(Bitch, stop looking so dumb)
You're so annoying, bitch, you make me nervous
Ask where I'm going, bitch, that's not your concern
I called your boyfriend, he said this bih always tripped
Nerd
Nerd
Nerd
I make
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
All they want to do is suck cock
That's why I love you like I do (Ooh yeah)
I just want hoes that can grab
Bitch doesn't get daylight, do you like me to?
You only see me late at night when a nigga wants to fuck
Bitch doesn't get daylight, do you like me to?
Dum-dum-diddy, a-dum-dum-diddy, oh, oh
I love you like I do
Dum-dum-diddy, a-dum-dum-diddy, oh
A-dum-dum-diddy, a-dum-dum-diddy, oh
A-dum-dum-diddy
Why i keep
You like? (And that's all the time)
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
All they want to do is suck cock
That's why I love you the way I do (You better know, girl)
I just want hoes that can grab
(I want the money, the money, the money, say what now)
Do you like what I do?
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
All they want to do is suck cock
That is why I do to you as I do (Here we go, I do to you as I do)
I just want hoes that can grab
Do you remember?
(Do you remember?)
It wasn't a stumble, we're all family
For once in life, this is your chance to be
Now dance for me
Like you did when you were a kid
It wasn't where you were from, it was where you lived
I give the girls when they got up from the church
I have to work, I'm trying to get some G
What are you up too?
As the stars go
Now that the police are getting difficult
They sent them, we went out
Undercover, to catch me
Somehow somehow the muthafuckas missed me
While they sleep I'm rapping, stacking
And looking for them niggas on the move, that's jacking
Its hot deposits, but no longer
Prepare to shoot or get shot
As long as it's from me to you or from you to me
Cause I'm an old school g
I pinch myself from the shoulders, whole on
Thinking of a young black makes a black grow old
Ooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
I keep a kitty in my pants, just in case you check
Yeah it's not love just because he's black
I'll put you on the map like this
Now, I'll give you dap, if you're real
That kills for the right
Not for the wrong thang!
Grab [?]
And get gangbang in your hair
And do it like they used to do on Soul Train
When I was a little black town
There was no murder, business, just happy feelings
I'm going to take it back to how it was
If you're down with me, I can get a right because
(touch the exact subject)
I keep a kitty in my pants just in case you're checking in
(6x)
Not only knee-deep, but he was going very deep when he fell on me
(3x)
Now I know I have to get it because I want it now, I have to have it
Check out this west coast anthem
Now is that tragic?
If you and my outfit, your hood and my hood
Nigga, it's all for the best
This is how we do it at 9-8
Not beach i hate
Just take a few shades and regulate
And it represents the golden state
And make muthafuckas move in the face
I need a bank, like Dre used to
When NWA was in the damn place
The case was abandoned, Cristal appeared
Then the great Dogg was snatched by the police
Dogg will no longer be given muthafuckin 'accessories
Now I'm older, only now
For trying to play me in the paint like Shaq Diesel
See I'm a little man with a big thang
But I prefer to make a big change in the game
So for me and for you or for you and for me
It doesn't really matter what you say you're going to do to me
Cause I'm an old school G
I fight from the shoulders until everything falls apart
Don't call me snoopy
Think of a silly black because a black grows old
I keep a kitty in my pants just in case you're checking in
(2x)
Not only knee-deep, but he was going very deep when he fell on me
Now, sure, sure, you're bankrupt, sure, sure, you're having trouble
Food stamps did not arrive on time and lights went out
But look here
Here's something about a nigga like me
He should never have let me out of the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker when I'm playing with my AK
Since I was young I smoked weed
Now I'm that motherfucker they read about
This is my gang nigga No limit
With the Pow Pow Bang Bang and your dead
And then we stamp that tank on your forehead
Wherever we go they say "DAMN"
They gangstas are fucking the show
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we're busy saying yes
To a child who admires me
Shit, life is nothing but grass and money
Shit, I'm that kind of nigga that's quick to explode
Fuck me or C and I'll put your foot in your ass
I don't give a shit because I keep selling
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they scream
Niggas living loud and stay 'over it' over it
Bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that shit G
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they scream
Niggas living loud and stay 'over it' over it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what sells
Bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that shit G
Any drugs trafficking gangs
We decided to shoot a week deep
Seen a nigga in Dayton, so we crawled
Very slow on you before you know it
I had my double pointing to your window
At that moment I knew I had to smoke his ass
It kept rolling, I jumped into the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck him
Then we head back to [?]
Sweating all the bitches in the dazzling dukes
We couldn't play checkers
With seven niggas on a Nav, are you crazy?
I was scared and it showed
So we all said "FUCK YOU BITCH" and we kept rolling
For the hood now we were 'fen for
Find something else to enter
Like a pussy or indeed
I get loud, shit, but we catch the rat pack
In a cold nigga that twists it
Snoop Dogg becomes ignorant when I'm fucking my tank dogs
I could stumble and still won't lose
Now I'm wrapped up in my gangsta blue
Cause I'm the type of nigga who's rushing to explode
Fuck me or C and I'll blow your ass off
Look I don't give a shit because I keep rescuing
What the hell are they screaming?
Niggas living loud and stay 'over it' over it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what sells
Bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that shit G
Hol wait on Craig B cut that shit man
Man, fuck, we need gangsta on this motherfucker, another one
Southern shit, I know what I'm saying
Some of that thiz-ird shit you already heard me
Here's another gangsta to ride
A T-shirt and Levi's is his only costume
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit
Well I'm C-Murder, who's he talking about
Nigga tried to touch me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed tried to catch me, you know some enemies
With $ 50 on the back in a navy blue top
Cause I'm the dumb C, slang and Snoop bang
For all my bitches, I know you're kidding with my crew
I want to fuck you too
You see no limit niggas, don't take no shit
So let me tell you motherfuckers that you're fucking with
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to explode
I don't give a shit because No Limit keeps selling
What the hell are they screaming?
Gangsta gangsta, that's what they scream
Niggas living loud and stay 'over it' over it
Gangsta gangsta, that's what sells
Bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that shit G
If you just stayed down and you were a real son of a bitch, you
But seeing how you want to jump off the ship and you thought the ship would sink
Back off with a periscope looking at your bitch ass
Now you come to my face and say "Hey, can I hang out?"
No, because you have no influence, bitch, go away
Now I'm tired of all of you fools like the damn paper chasing hoes
Uhh, this has been a public service announcement from No Limit Records.
Doggy lit a match and the match went out
G-Unit, it's in the fucking house

Doggy lit a match and the match went out
G-Unit is in the fucking house (DoggHouse)
You keep talking shit, I'll put my gun in your mouth
My gun in your mouth, I'll show you what I'm fighting about
Sit back, relax nigga before I click
Dig this, I did that but I can't admit that
Suckas took away the laws, these hoes want my giveaways
because he tried to hurt me, but I had to back off
In fact, when I hit him he was bloody
His friend tried to peel off, but I had to kill that.
Real lawn niggas, shit, I know you guys feel that
We won't talk, no need for that (fuck)
The word in Snoop is I'm a G for that
A 'G' for what? Damn niggas without speaking
See the best way to leave a black man in a coffin
I made it so clean that no one speaks (shhhh)
It's like flipping a bitch, I'm Cryp'n with this
I'm gonna fuck up and have you niggas missing and shit
Doggy lit a match and the match went out
G-Unit is in the motherfuckers 'house (Motherfuckers' house!)
You keep talking shit, I'll put my gun in your mouth
My gun in your mouth, I'll show you what I'm fighting about
Yes Yes Yes Yes

There's nothing but the crazy DPG Unit, BA-BAY!
Whose black is that you love to hear?
I will return with the complete artillery, I will return with them with a full battery
Snoop and Supa, Daz go and walk again for the money
We come from playing those damn games, so raise your flags
Now keep on nigga bitch, put your body up with chalk
G dippin, we Cryp'n, Dogg Pound Gangsta mission
Blastin a straight killer flashin the heat
Don't make me dick because I'm not going to stop
(Killing a black man trying to fuck with a G)
Got my 9 in my pocket bitch, start an apocalypse
Doggy lit a match and the match went out
G-Unit is in the motherfuckers 'house (Motherfuckers' house!)
My gun in your mouth, I'll show you what I'm fighting about
Nigga now has to let me break it down for you how it will be
You don't want to fuck with Snoop because then you have to fuck with me
Unit G, DPG - go 'head
Start some shit, I have my leash with me
Watch how the niggas get to duckin when I get to bustin
It's nothing, I'll touch it for talking too much, I'll cut it
Push my knife and then fuck it
The strong survive, the bitches perish nigga you'll see
Even the paramedics couldn't save him
I gave one to the chest and sixteen to the face.
They hit me and then I called Cochran to get me out of the case
I had to stand out in the rain just to sell my package
Doggy lit a match and the match went out
G-Unit is in the motherfuckers 'house (Motherfuckers' house!)
You keep talking shit, I'll put my gun in your mouth
I'm straight from southside jamaica nigga
I'm for my paper nigga, your words won't make or break a nigga
I'll put your bitch on a track, make her break a nigga
I have rings like the Los Angeles Lakers, black!
So on my normal day, I burn longer than a candle. Rest In Peace
And my neck is an anchor
The equivalent of a Gorilla from Unit G to a Gangsta from Dogg Pound
Doggy lit a match and the match went out
G-Unit is in the motherfuckers 'house (Motherfuckers' house!)
My gun in your mouth, I'll show you what I'm fighting about
Yes
And you just don't stop, you just don't give up
Don't stop, don't give up, control
Big Snoop Dogg comes with the drip
Jump to Bayless, Shannon doesn't get it
Let me release it, don't exploit it, just stop it because you know I have to get over it
Snoop

When the pimp is in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
When pigs try to reach you
Park like it's hot, park like it's hot, park like it's hot
Explode it like it's hot, exploit it like it's hot, exploit it like it's hot
I have the Rollie on my arm, and I'm pouring Chandon
And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it running
I'm a good guy with good dreams
Do you see these ice cubes? Do you see these ice creams?
Eligible single, million dollar pot
That's whiter than what spills down your throat
The ghost, outside like fish eggs
The inside like the red suicide doll
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, this is how you get hooked
Murderer with a rhythm, I know murderers on the street
So don't try to run down my ear
Talking all that rough shit, trying to ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest, they won't give me shit
You should think about it, take a second (Ding)
Made of matter, you should take four, B
And think before you fuck with lil 'Skateboard P
When the pimp is in the crib, ma
When pigs try to reach you
Park like it's hot, park like it's hot, park like it's hot
And if a black man has an attitude
Explode it like it's hot, exploit it like it's hot, exploit it like it's hot
And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it running
I'm a gangsta, but everyone knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah I had to do that
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side
There's no other way to play like I play
I cut a lot, you thought I was a DJ
"Two, one, yes, three!"
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
Look, I specialize in getting all the girls to undress
So bring your friends, everyone come in
We have a world premiere here, now live!

When the pimp is in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot
And if a black man has an attitude

I go out hard, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so strong
If you touch me close, you're in a red ray
Oh, you have a gun, so you want to go back?
AK-47 now, black, for that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
They can't find you, and now they miss you
I must remind you, I'm just here to turn you
Gun whip, dip it, then flip
So dance to this damn music we record
Baby, come closer, let me see how you let go!
When the pimp is in the crib, ma
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot

Chef boy-ar-P is back in the kitchen
You niggas are scratching, my niggas are itching
Yes, black, P means Polish
None of you are fucking with him, and this is obvious.
I'm Ron Artest, lying in your trash
And anyone who can get it, even fans in the stands
These weapons are a sun, you will tan with your man

Jail or coffin, in any way that rizzot
But now I'm so cool that you could smell me through a Ziploc
Mr. S Dizzot, it's not gon 'stizzop
Too cool for bullshit to handcuff her ass
Snitch how can they can't catch the boy
These niggas give out cases like a liquor store
Running to the DA trying to catch me
All the money you made, I'm like forgetting the law
I'm not 'frizzaid', it's Jizzay, friend, you pinched yourself
Take it like a man, the flow made you run away from the storm age (go sit down)

I never pretend funk, niggas know I'm not a punk
Do you want beef? 'Yes, cuh', open the trunk
We go all the way, we do it in real size
Yes, and she protects my interest.
Oh little friend, your defense is defenseless
A pimp apprentice, hey, come here princess
(Come here, come here)
I know you're tired of the chatter

Newly dressed, I jump up trying to find something from Zest
Psyche, we like Bom, someone must sound the alarm
And hitting people on the forum
I'll see the black boss in charge
Push ... Bush out of the office, pull until they get off us
Make them deals, leave niggas in coffins
Can you feel it, my nigga? I'm about to kill him, my niggas
Sounds like guerrillas, for 'real' out of the gangsta government miles
Coca Cola, when it comes to turning off the microphone with me
I was branded in a gang, fucking having techniques
Just ride, don't let these fools breathe
Pop peas, keys, find a stash of cheese
Hell yeah, they'll be hating the 3 good friends
Ferocious overdose, WestCoast indeed
Hit the gangsta shit, so you know he's on deck
Hold on and respect, cold as it gets, I don't want to taste
Kidnap your wife and children, you get the message
Madness, he ordered me to spit wildly
Suffer casualties, challenge me, I handle it fast
Without speaking, C-Walkin ', we choked
Leaving the Glock out
And throw up DoggHouse
WestCoast niggas and everyone in your house
Gang bang niggas, let's turn this bitch
Ridaz eastside and all in your mouth
Dogg Pound Gang we let the Mothaf out ** kin 'doggs
I never loved a ho and run the "G-A" on me
I always have a bitch, but never in the front seat
Yes! is about to drive Crip'd crazy
Don't shoot that little mothaf ** ka no mo '
That's not what he said when he hit the chest, it pierced his heart, it came out of his elbow
You shouldn't have been talking about that fucking bitch boy
Saying the Wrong Against the Real McCoy
I didn't know it was a cold blooded gangsta
If you are not riding with us, we will catch you can
We exploit, reload and sew
Shots sprayed into the crowd, like a charged bomb
Keep this mothaf ** ka jumping until they close it
Then we dive in with a sip and some hoes to fuck
Pour late, down the hard road, no bustas here
So explicit that you can only get it once a year
Eastsidaz, the ridaz, change the game
And just so you know, from here we go, we directly came to hit
Put me on a leash if you dare and I doubt you
While clapping, it's bigger than that
Fuck fools, that has never paid us
Blue rags with blue balls, for everything you have
I scream at the killas
Yes they stealas and muggers
Are they D-O double G'z
Ain't nobody really screwed up wit?
Who let the mothaf ** kin 'doggs out?
DoggHouse in your mouth
We niggas people talk

Niggas betta run and hide, we're about to ride
Who let the mothaf ** kin 'doggs out?

It's still the same, let the mothaf ** kin 'doggs out
Nigga you're young! {Echoes}
No one hosts an east side party like us
No one ... no one does it better
Break the grass and drink and relax and get high
I have shit like always, you know, so enjoy
Ladies and friends all in the mix, it's time to relax
Sha-La-La brought the orange, with the zags and the blunt
Wind up some Bob Marley joints from a skunk, Daz with Thai
And Nate got a hundred pieces.
So we disarm correctly in the O.Z
We in the area bombed feeling good, you know
I have friends and friends in the neighborhood, you know
And it's a Long Beach thang where I was born and hung out
To all my players, hustlers and gang members, listen
It's time to kick a rhyme to fuck shit
Now who throws shit?
No one hosts an east side party like us
No one ... no one does it better
Gangsta now run this motherfucker? (Hell yeah!)
Or do the ladies run this motherfucker? (Hell yeah!)
No one hosts an east side party like us
No one ... no one does it better
Now the party is packed, hitting back to back
And Daz on the turntables spinning a scratch (HA!)
I'm on the mic, so I'm gonna blow a rap
And I'm going to dedicate this one to a pack of sweatshirts
The Dogg Pound Nation, Locs and Large Group
These are the towns I see rocking the party
Make a nigga want to poplock on the flo '
And make the Boogaloo shrimp and pimp the ho
I have to owe them my life because I'm an O.G
I have love in the hood because I'm the great friend
I have the skills when it comes to rockin rhymes
So raise your hands to the sky, take yours, I have mines
Now everything is live, don't you agree?
And if you do, then keep dancing with that black D-O-double-G
We ride with the hat on the side of the trip
Everyone knows how we do it on the east side
And we true party-goers like Afrika Bambaataa
Because we keep everything on point from the drink to the joint
So pass the bottle, no need to fight
And give it to the little friend, let him swallow
It's a eastern thatside, nigga, bring your ass
G is up Ho is down, nigga, you know the show
No one hosts an east side party like us
No one ... no one does it better
(What are you looking at the clock for?) The clock is ticking
But he won't stop kicking because everyone kicks him
And catch the bitches, which is the main thing gangsters do
The blow jumps because the rump is what I came to see
New pussy in the hood, will I kill him? (Kill him!)
From the way it blew it up, no, it's probably hotter than a frying pan
But honey, don't modify it, like you're not a weirdo
I keep my game tight, no leaks
So we can keep this to a minimum
And take a ride with the Dogg and let me show you what the pound is for
Candlelight and romance '
If I can get the last dance in the mansion
No one hosts an east side party like us
No one ... no one does it better
No one hosts an east side party like us
No one ... no one does it better
Snoop dogg
They wonder how I do it, that's that big boy shit
State Seattles means, those are big boy kicks
The way I make fun of a bitch, that's the big spit boy
I've been all over the world, I made my time in the pen
Niggas in gangbangs is back on them swings
So how could you disrespect my house?
Since '93 strong, it was all in your face
Great shows in arenas, picking bitches that Trina
Party like rock stars in the bars where I saw her
I made my move up close, you owe me
I brought the west back, what did you do?
There is no one better than me
True rock star hoodie on me
There is no one better than me
S-S-N-double O-E
Slow motion in the fast lane
Sitting at the top of the game where you're not
Show after show, bank row at the Rolls
Living well, big slice, made me slam doors
Three-piece suit with pocket watch.
Snoop comes in [?], Everyone riding Chrome like you have to stop soon
Group pressure towards me, way to stop, knock on the seat
I was the pig in the streets
I entered the game and violated the law in these rhythms
The slow flow killed and people said I hit like it was getting cold
High above the stars, Snoop Dogg is the best feeling
Plastics and all it was was keeping it true
I brought the west back, what did you do?
Who understands it as I did? (No one)
You're just in it, nigga, I run it
Like I can't get on your grill cause I live in the hills
Snoopie this, Snoopie that, yeah, I heard what you said
Young destroyer, let me see your ID
I just paid a bill that passes VIP
I gave niggas a lane to represent that G-A-N-G-S-T-A in me
I've been paralyzed, I've been pimpin ', I've been doing the doing
Knocked down to the shoes, man I put myself in the shoes
Cotis in the mall, I've been keeping the truth
I'm back west, what the hell did you do, nigga?
It's like wherever I look and wherever I go
But it's nothing, because I see my black Coolio
You know some of you niggas are so deceptive
Using my styles as a contraceptive
I hope you burn
It seems that you have not learned
It's the bauble, patty-whack
I still have the biggest bag!
So put your gun away, run away, cause I'm back
Why? hit them, pick them up, spit them out
It makes me want to scream, because my dollars come in zones OR
Known for breaking up so take off your clothes
Speaking of hoes, I kick the doors
Put my nuts on your chin and the story continues
Why the bitch niggas always talk shit?
I knew it was a hoe
I have split my gums
You didn't know fool-fool-fool
And my shit hurts, so run, ring the alarm
I thought you knew I'm crazy like Tony Montana
In the mix running shit, oops and um ...
The softest, coolest, merciless, you know
On a kamikaze mission (ooh, if I can be like Snoop)
Keep wishing, listen
With my balls in your jaws, make room to stick my cock

Badabang Badabang
I have a chain that you can see through
Graduated to a rank of a Regal
Hit the stick and I'll go with it 82
That's the difference between you and me
Just like we do, Remy head to head and you chase yours
On a world tour, me and Skateboard
We ate more bitches in the molly hall
Pretty sexy but exotic, fill them all in my Ferrari, yeah
I'll probably be home before I park the car
I have them running upstairs, I have them in pairs
Can I get rid of your jacket? Can I touch you there?
Took off underwear, no hair underneath
I solemnly swear, I will not share
This game with a lame, let him learn for himself
I don't owe a nigga a shit, better win for himself
Stop tripping on me, worry about yourself

Around 9 o'clock, stop by the record store
And get that new Snoop Dogg, now we're bouncing ball
Life is a mystery, my life is like history.
Stop by my dispensary
Give me some kush and pusha
Put it in the trunk, smelling of skunk
But everything is legal in LA
Everyone taking a hit from politicians.
My dentist even hit him, Dr. Beecher
He says "Snoop Dogg, I really want to meet you"
Yes i love showing you now

My DJ now plays my tune a DJ jam
Look at me like one of the two that I thought you knew
Wherever I go, I see I have to kill another crew
Different enemies that know me, I am the K-U-R-U-P and for the T
Kurupt man, what's up, do I know you?
So I say to the bitch like this, you're just shit
Because wherever I go, I have to let them know about him
Paddle, so here we go, so I know that punk niggas know
Oh me whoop there it is nah snoop there it is
Kurupt and Snoop Dogg as if they were children
Go crazy ripping and flipping and sinking
And that's how we flow, it's still death row
And Snoop Doggy Dogg and I'm so [?]
From coast to coast and I'm like a lobster
I focus on nonsense and I'm not smoking [?]
This is Snoop Doggy Dogg, now you would focus
I'm so rude and radical that I'm going to look [?] Wherever I go I see that I have to
Do what I do to other motherfuckers from other cliques
Try taking a step for me nigga to load a clip
I see these motherfuckers from this other outfit
It's time to kill because a nigga like me, like Shaquile, I have to hit their ass
I put on the leash and look for a kitten lying like this, they shouldn't act like they want to run, now they're done
They smoke nigga this the west coast
I break niggas, shake niggas, take niggas all their way
It's like 9-4 when I'm on probation
I really don't give a shit the shit they talk about
Kurupt come here again
Hey, another day for me to get raw
Me? I relax with Snoopy Doggy Dogg
Every hoe I see recognizes how they go
But still, Snoopy's niggas act like they don't know my name
Oh oh
I don't give a shit because I'm just a nigga
I imagine the biggest niggas have reason to trigger
Now I was walking in the park one day
Why [N-O-K?] Smoking a fat J '
Me and my dj sitting pussy
Five or six bitches roll on a -64 hit switch
They say Snoop Doggy Dogg is you?
I say what the hell, yeah you know I'm having fun in gray
I spit my game on this hoe, her name is 'Faye Dunaway'
She stays around the corner, hey
Because I really don't give a shit
I mean, we have a party, let's light this
It's in my living room and we have ozone
So all we want to see is assholes and boobs
Jerking and jerking, breaking off taking off clothes because
We don't love them hoes
You have everything you want
When you caught me in lies
Did you know that other women were not mine
Then you stayed by my side
Everything you want and need
Because everything you want and need
I will be, I will be
For eternity
I give you my love every day
I'm yours anyway
You and your niece, Jacquees and me.
We can make love between the sheets
All you can eat from me is a feast
So sweet, so rough, so hard, so bad
Get what you want, throw it in the bag
I stayed with myself even when I did wrong
That's probably why I'm singing this song
Put your face on my right arm, tattoo
I met you, gotchu, I caught you
You are my angel, god bless you
Who am I in love with? Only you
Smoking and caressing, just the two of us
This is splendid, flex and fold
Spread it out for you
Now let me play it for you
You get what she doesn't want because she doesn't compare
You get what you want because you've been there for me
Carefully prepared to lay down your life for me
My life would be nothing with outchu
And I'm not doing anything with outchu
You have everything you want
You have everything you need
Yes i remember the times
When you caught me in lies
Did you know that other women were not mine
Then you stayed by my side
So everything
Everything you want and need
I will comfort you, I will give you all of me
Because everything you want and need
It will be you and me (that will be all)
For eternity (yes)
I'm yours in any way (in any way)
I was taking money from the city (OT)
But it happened at the right time (it worked)
And I know you got drips, quick whips, and mansions
Like when you withdraw money, I know I can too
Yes, I have run out of money, I have not run out of money
And I keep it like a hunnid
Good head, bitch, let it get into my stomach (uh-huh)
First lady, still married to money
Damn, he was deep, he was still playing
We were both young until I made him a man
Bitches do it for the 'Gram, but I really am who I am
If you get up in a traffic jam, I'll go with the bands
I love you like that woman who took you
Back and forth, no carousel, die for you like burials
Yes, I'm going to war if it's for you (all day)
It's not for me, so it's not true (no, it's not)
I want to be the last one you have to lie to
I have everything I need if I havechu
You have everything you want
You have everything you need
Yes i remember the times
When you caught me in lies
Did you know that other women were not mine
Then you stayed by my side
Everything you want and need (everything)
I will comfort you, I will give you all of me (all of me)
Because everything you want and need
I will be, I will be
For eternity
I give you my love every day
Is this on?
Yes
Not
Now i just left the club and now i'm breaking the cocoon
I am trembling to risk the Executive Branch
Now i'm making them dance
Keep a blunt in my hand and two packages in my pants
You know the greenest bud and the strength of the leaf.
I am indian chief
They call me Bossaniva, Evel Knieva, Sativa Breatha
Imperial
And brought to you live in stereo
One come try me now
I'm moving while I'm groovin ', floating in a cloud of sound
The girls want to kiss us, boo, we have ours
It's the big boss Dogg in my ratchet flow
It is the fantastic original
Acid flow
With the great white interior
It tastes so good
The gentlemen's choice for sure
The right big cigarette
Pillow
In the middle
I never scream
I recite the rhymes from my hood
Smoke one this' for the good times
So let the girls on the flo '
They just left the Bellagio.
They heard that we are in the honeycomb
Now they want the carnival
It's a party, everyone here.
Done that, did that, been here
Hell yeah shot
We are not fucking without dust
There are no Backwoods, Phillies or any others.
The only one, from the homie
SN double O
One for the money
Two for the show
Three to prepare
Now let's blow
Executive branch, branch, branch, branch, branch
Executive branch, branch, branch, branch, branch
Let's blow (blow blow)
For the good times
Brought to you by
Big Snoop DO double G
And the creators of the Executive Power
The choice of the knights.
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground
Drinking yak while raising my state of mind
Hand in hand by the burner in case a black man tries to rape
Never going down, keep going up like Andre
Because my corner goes back every thing the gift says
Long Beach yeah I scream it in every song
Err day, err night until they take me home
Always known, big ball, give it a try in the city
Then I screamed far ahead on the net
And when they mention the best, will they call your name?
There are only winners and losers, there is nothing in between
Either you get to the hall of fame or you're ashamed
And you don't have to wonder where my place is
Blue Pepsi rags something poppin ', bitch knows that
A hit of the bong will return your face
LMFAO to the bank, boy, ASAP
Feeling like my life froze
I'm about to hit the ground
Live it like you're talking
Flow so straight but a nigga won't try to get in
I'm so high yeah the grass I'm still teasing her
My bitch is bad and my diamonds still shine
I got the competition shaking like parkinson's
Bread is in the bag, call it good marketing
Life is a bitch, but I don't play
That's the word to the third letter
Shots, shots, shots for me and my cheddar
Execute this master of ceremonies, I am harder than leather
Because I don't come from a long way
Only God knows how long the Dogg has
Because as time we all pass
I'm about to hit the ground
I sold my soul to the devil, it's a horrible deal
This game you could never win
Because they love you, then they hate you, and then they love you again
Get away from me misery
Get away from me, you false bitches, I can't bear the falsehood
Get out of me
I can only make only blows
I am an only child lost in the world
Where did the lonely children go, when the bell rings?
It feels like hell sounds
Bringing back
He is checking my background
It is ironic what is happening
Imagine if I didn't have the ends
I wouldn't have that many imaginary friends
I'm spaced dog, I'll be in that talk of the moon
I wonder if God asks Mike how to walk on the moon
I swear by mom, I wish my father and I talk more
And we will not change, so we will not agree again
Until then I will pour out my soul
Just a few things I see with my eyes closed
And I can see it with my eyes closed, now
Feeling like my life froze
Look at it with your eyes closed
Look at it with your eyes closed
Look at it with your eyes closed
Girl you got me fading
And I can't go another day
Makes it hard to stay awake
Girl you got me fading
There are no other words to say
You make it hard for me to stay
Girl you got me fading
Fadin away
And my mind is about you
We fuss and fight, you fight for that life
I just want to love you well
Girl you got me fading
And I can't go another day
Makes it hard to stay awake
Girl you got me fading
Girl you got me fading
You make it hard for me to stay
Fadin away
Make time to make love
That's what we did
Looking today, it looks like it's going to fade away
If you lose the baby, another will win
What does a brother know? Keep it low
It's supposed to go
Feel the same, we provide, we publish
And if everything works, then Casper the ghost
Commune shit and shit shit, we prepare everything for
Playing with me, oh, better let it go
I'm fading
Makes it hard to stay awake
Girl you got me fading
There are no other words to say
You make it hard for me to stay
Girl you got me fading
Fadin away
Yes
This is uh
Snoopy collins
Can you smell me
That's Dan Funk
Uh
The love you used to love
It just doesn't appear anymore
Find and seek
Seek and you shall find
Find time to relax
Yes my love
Fadin away
And I can't go another day
Girl you got me fading
There are no other words to say
You make it hard for me to stay
Fadin away
It's hard to stay with your girl
And even harder to play with your girl
It is very difficult to stay with your girl
Fadin away
Fadin away
Fadin away
Fadin away
Fadin away
Fadin away
Fadin away
Hanging on the drug scene slandering your keys
Four lil, five lil, six lil cops
No, knowing that I'm running on the roof
I have my red lightning, I better have you bulletproof
Because the light is not lost once I put it in your dome
They got my friends kidnapped, now they can catch up
Al Capone was a hero of mine
Where are they? where are they? oh they in the back
So I must take my time and make sure that my nine
Grab him, catch him, spot him, shoot him, they shot him
And now they call me Snoop Gotti
I'm like a fugitive Harrison Ford
Slipping on the Chevy now the shit is getting heavy
But you know I can't drown so I call my nigga Loc
I have to find the hiding place and a big bag of smoke
Because if you slip, you fall asleep on death row
And the judge sentenced me to do about a century
I'm mobbin 'through the county main line
Back in 9500, just try to handle mines
As we try to pass the time, waiting for the chains
When a black is still alive, right?
Wake up at five o'clock, roll call, call Doggy Dogg
I'll be in the food hall from there, I wander around the patio
Still over-performing, so you know what time it is
I wear a black in a minute, respecting the rules of the pen
Hitting the push-ups by the g to get bigger
Eight months, I'm in trouble, my mind is clearer
Every day of my life I glimpse in the mirror
And guess what the fuck I'm starting to see
I still regulate sleep in the penitentiary
They brainwashed you not knowing that you grew up wanting to be a pimp, you wanted to be a gamer (Right) You know, you grew up wanting to be these different things that are role models for you in your neighborhood, until you discover that ... wait .. I'm going to be the first role model other than that. (Correct)
Well I had a chance to listen to the album, it's very relaxing, it definitely makes you want to smoke weed
(Oh yeah?)
Yeah i don't even smoke
(Do you want to hit something now?)
I don't know if we are allowed to do that here.
(We need curtains, we need curtains here)
No, Snoop can do whatever he wants to do
(I do not think so...)
Do not ask permission, ask for forgiveness
And there is no doubt about it
All the songs I made, and going back to the kids
I mean I've been everywhere where you want to go
And explode on a stick like a pogo
My logo is similar to the bat sign
High up in the sky, when you wanna get high
Now look up, now look up, I shook the game
With versatility, verbability, togtwistagility
Hell yeah they love the dog
Everybody's grandma wants to hug the dog
How I feel about Snoop
How I feel about Snoop
How I feel about Snoop
How I feel about Snoop
How I feel about Snoop
See I'm back melodramatic
A little more drug for Snoop Dogg addicts
Addicted to the things I do, magic
Go go go but there is no contraption, I am magic
If it wasn't invented
Then you probably wouldn't even know how to represent it
However, really, I love that real hood wherever I go
From moms, babies, grandmothers
You have to love it even if you can't bear it
How I feel about Snoop
How I feel about Snoop
How I feel about Snoop
How I feel about Snoop
How I feel about Snoop
You are back now at departure time
This is DJ EZ Dicc
In W-Balls
Right now something new by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one is for the ladies of all the boys.
A big bow wow wow
Cause we'll make it a little foggy here tonight
At the station that hits you in the fat ass
With a fat cock
When I met you last night, baby
Before opening your gap
I respect you lady
But now I get it all back
Because you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise you baby, I'll call you
Next time i feel a little hot
Can you come
And i will break you
And if you can't fuck that day baby
Well if Kurupt cared about a bitch, he would always be broke
I'd never have a motherfucker to smoke
Bitch, you can't make me
Do we look alike BBD, hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the hell am I supposed
To pay this just to put this ho
I know the pussy is mine
There is nothing more to do with it.
Pass it to the friend, now you hit it
Cause she's just a bitch to me
Why don't they pay attention?
Approach her with a different proposal
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only bitch trick
It's not fun if friends can't have any
It's not fun if friends can't have any
It's not fun if friends can't have any
Guess who back in the fucking house
With a fat cock for your damn mouth
Because when the bitches get rowdy and throw a voodoo
What are you going to do?
You really don't know
So I advise you not to trust that
Knowing very well, I'm too caught up in my grip
Now as the sun turns and my game gets bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this black called Snoop?
Puppy, I'm all of the above
I'm too fast to catch up on your hoes
But look, it's not fun
If my friends can't prove it
Because you know i don't love them
Court! Hey now you know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready and four to press the switches
In my Chevy, '64 - red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So back off, bitch, cause I'm fighting
Just get on your knees and then start juggling
These damn nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G, the black with the influence
It's not fun if friends can't have any
It's not fun if friends can't have any
It's not fun if friends can't have any
Slide you feel good
I know what you need girl
Smoke weed, girl
Sit down, let me take your time!
I impress the ladies, no questions baby
I have the answer for you and me
It makes you feel like heaven!
Put on your makeup and your Gucci
Rock star like, baby, camera, lights, movies on!
Also, I feel the atmosphere of what you want
You'll be doing that cool thing
Everything new, grown
Got you coming back, turn around, boomerang
Underground doing things
Girl I know you like that
Don't get hard, sweet as a
Nigga like a running store, afraid to run
Try to catch a milly! (Slow down!)
Baby let me catch you
Pick up that cake, take it, wake up with you
Stand back and try the picture
I have a great skirt because I'm that man!
I keep my plan focused, my focus is you
We're cool like a bo, we're cool like a two
I'm sitting on my whip outside, now go out and alone
Welcome to the majors with Soopafly, watch live!
We go back to the house, to the pool, drink or die
Take it off, slide over me!
Work it like a Romeo, slide on it, make it cream
Oreo double fill
I'm like Mario, I took out my chest
Macking while I sit, you can take out the rest
Pray to get your next outing, swipe left and
Now i'm looking at your best friend
She bad !! I look at the mess we're in
And I don't play any games though
Also, that's not what I came for
(No) I want to slide, smoke with you
Rub at your angle
So give me your head like a bankroll
I have a good disposition, girl
I like you in this position, girl
I'm the boss, get submissive, girl
So you can just
I have to win, the gold medal caught my attention (first place)
My eye (first place), ooh
Champion on every street I survive
I have to win, the gold medal caught my attention (first place)
OG, S-N-double O-P
Money talk, nigga, shit walk
Big dog, you could never cut me (What?)
I need everything in advance, without backend
On deck all the time, there's no shortage
Rotating head because anything can happen
I was hitting before rapping
I was slandering before I was catching (catching)
Always running, it's automatic
We lost Nip too soon, that's tragic
But it gave LA more wins than Magic.
Champions never die, they are eternal
Cuban convertibles and bonds as a prize
I have to win, the gold medal caught my attention (first place)
My eye (first place), ooh
Champion on every street I survive
I have to win, the gold medal caught my attention (first place)
My eye (first place), ooh
I'm a boss, I'm a genius, I can't turn it off
Many niggas ain't caught on this cloth
You are witnessing the evolution of a gangster
After all the clashes with the law (What?)
After life threw all those curved balls at me (curved balls)
You thought I gave up, but no (Nah)
Mature man, throw it away, stay upright
I rushed every day, how do you think I have everything?
I did it my way, I broke many laws
All real, I've never lied to them
Cuban convertibles and bonds as a prize
I have to win, the gold medal caught my attention (first place)
My eye (first place), ooh
Champion on every street I survive
I have to win, the gold medal caught my attention (first place)
My eye (first place), ooh
Just a hip-hop queen like that
Love and write, let's do it
Yes welcome to church volume two
Exclusive two one three
New snoop Dogg Nate Dogg word g
Riding in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
Sang on how his heart broke
People look for stars
I'm just not going to be something you wrote
When you are alone it is very cold
Don't act like you don't know
She let me play with her heart
I said I would be home soon
The whole time the girl was home alone
Let me tell you why you cry
(yes, super fly but I am super duper and I am super duper fly)
(Snoop Dogg)
I will be great in this
I know you expected this
And i wanted this
To be praised and so stringuis
So you just slide by
Is this how you left for his eeh?
But won't you talk to a beach?
Let me help your pride
I am like the Countess, a pasta, a preacher or a psychologist.
A sherk in a weirdo
Me where mink skater boots
And I'm the leg rit is scaloo
And I'm not used to the shoe
And I love two two
Deep feet as I slide down the street
I'm from the LBC
And I don't know what has been heard from me.
I am a true pimp beach of the two three crew
Now look here silly if you are going to fuck or hang out with the dog
Holla on er Nate Dogg
(Chorus 1x)
Three pieces with his partner in me
I have to think my s * i * stinks
Pocket paddles come from edge
Cold cooler looking at the lion king
Crying and thangs
Cause I'm with Snoop and Nate
Singing rymin 'and thangs
I'm late because I'm the reason for the change
I'm not resourceful for games
Cock again and i'm trying to target
So stregulatin been playing the game
There is no error in the game
For a mother f-in thrizzle
Shippin on the sizzle
And that's for shizzle
Fo times for the riddle
You know these bahrs
Wherever we go, you know who we are
Sampain, Caviare
Bubble bath, I say I love you and I laugh
(Chorus 1x)
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
Let me take you on a journey around the world
And if you can find the time to fly in the sky
Just you and me, to paradise
Because you are my special girl
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
We are living in a special world
Why you are a special girl
Then you should fly away, fly away with me
(Could you fly with me?)
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
(Would you fly away, would you fly with me?)
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
(Because I want to fly away with you, fly away with me)
Fly away, fly away, fly away
So far so far
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
(Tell me you want to go)
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
(Fly away with me)
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
I'd take you anywhere (?) Let's fly
Just let me put this [?] Fly away
We will be so high in the sky and we will never go down
So baby would you fly with me
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
(Fly with a G, you and I, we can go, wherever you want to go baby)
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
(So far, so far, so far, so far)
I want to fly so far
I want to fly so far
I want to fly that far baby, could you fly with me
Focus on me
Baby can you focus on me
Baby can you focus on me
Baby can you focus on me
Focus on me
So much smoke in the air, you can't see shit
Servin 'crip dick' until the bitch is sick from the sea
Shit from west to east for all my dawgs and my Heathcliffs
Taxy streets so the heat is on my lap
When it's war, fuck the law, fuck me, bury me tied
Money of up to 21 Cadillacs
Made of matter, scratch it like BattleCat
Just nigga with a star that got in the park, nigga
That's on the set, that's on my mom
I could still stop in the park, nigga
Focus on me
God I did that I did that
Focus on me
Every word I rapped, nigga, I lived that
Focus on me
Give up, I did that, I did that
Gang members rejoice when they hear my voice
Lifting on Rolls Royce, the bell in full force
Realizing that I'm still the source
The wrong move could get my kids killed
So I focus on myself
Making sure all this shit keeps rolling
And my baby boo neck freezes
Rico rolling, on the clock, non-stop
And my bank account shows it
So don't worry about mine, nigga, we're alright
And fuck what they think, "Free suggestion"
Diamond on the back with leather with wood inside
I hit around the world, made sure to keep the hood
Yes once for the king
And I keep smoking a nigga like a big bag of weed
In moms
Focus on me
God I did that I did that
Focus on me
Every word I rapped, nigga, I lived that
Focus on me
Give up, I did that, I did that
Focus on me
Baby can you focus on me
Baby can you focus on me
Baby can you focus on me
Baby can you focus on me
Baby can you focus on me
Well it's that slow flow, D-O-double-G, black
Who I am? (He's Kurupt son of a bitch)
Do or die (we give a fucking shit)
So slow down your roll, I'm in control like Janet
The twenty-one-year-old nigga on this planet.
Take it for granted, if you want, because I'm going to
Grab my leash and then clear the corner, beeotch!
Shake your damn hands in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Shake your damn hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your damn hands up in the air
Now in one, two, three, who could it be?
So ninety-four blacks came back
Because it's not shit for sale in the Coupe
And my cousin Snoop is fine, you know what I mean
And it doesn't take long for Dogg's pound to pop a cap
In your ass, for making us all screwed
Now check it out, it's a call for niggas like Doggs
Who is the shit supposed to be, but constantly like bitches?
(Yes, you) other Doggs (yes, you) Yiggy, all of you
Stay full of that gin and juice and have fun
Now how many bitches should be fucked?
Before they say Daz is that nigger of the time
You never thought I would see it bustin with Dr. Dre
Because I grab microphones, rip microphones in half
Hoes will come to my flat so I can touch that ass
So all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
Shake your damn hands in the air
Wave your damn fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Shake your damn hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your damn hands up in the air
You're heading my way, nigga, you better make a quick U-turn
So what is going on? I'm shitting shit like a western movie
The kingpin of the clique, first class
The mill fool's career was interrupted by trying to serve
Kurupt's best era, look at the terror, because it's a murder festival
I smoke chronic every day so what do we have
Another motherfucker, who serves like a cavy
Now who, drops (rhymes rhymes) I got the juice like 2Pac
(I'm also) shooting with two Glocks
Hellraisin like Pinhead, be careful, I'm crying shit
Slow down, like your legs are broken
Who is joking Rakim never joked, so why should he?
Now that's my idol, check the vital range of rhyme flow
Mediocre motherfuckers die because I'm serving and
They can't fuck with me or see me, I'm a mass murderer
(I'm raw as news material) I'm tough like a BF Goodrich
(Bring your whole set and lynch your hood)
Look at killer styles and poetic techniques
So all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your damn fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Shake your damn hands in the air
Keep your damn fingers in the air
Take it down, when it comes to the microphone, I'm losing weight
And that's 175 pounds of beef
Banging your ass to the concrete
Fool, act like you know
I'm stranded on death row with nowhere to go, so
What is a girl to do
Take out a team, or two, a few, what do you want to do?
So all my bitches and my niggas and my niggas and my bitches
Shake your damn hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Wave your damn fingers in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Shake your damn hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your damn hands up in the air

These are the tales, the strange tales
These are the tales, the strange tales
These are the stories that I tell so well
I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I put the microphone on
When I met Joan, I took her home.
All I wanted was to go crazy with a man
When I met Ann, I shook her hand.
We ended up fucking around a garbage can
The next young monster I met was Red
I took her to my house and she gave me the head.
She likes cocks, is all she said
We skipped the sheets and broke my bed
There is another girl, her name is Sherry.
You talk about sex and the girl acts scary
I heard I was crazy about my older brother Jerry
I took her to my crib and I took out that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Put her in bed and the girl is a beast
She will only start talking about signing a lease
I met a tender young woman, her name is Lori
An X-rated movie wouldn't tell its story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
My girlfriend was called Michelle
Their booty was bigger than a whale's tail.
When I scared Michelle, I scared her good
Her pussy got hotter than hell flames
Didn't want to do it because the bitch was there? Flagrantly?
I tossed it aside and spit out that game.
I had many monsters in my life
One night I went crazy with this girl named Pam
The next day I saw her with her man.
I had an old tender, her name is Jeanine
She was thirty-eight and I was only seventeen
She likes to go crazy, she's just a devil
It didn't really matter when I saw her in jeans
I want a big monster, fat and sloppy
I kick back and see how the ho just mops me
A Wide Alabama Country
I met this monster, her name was Beth
Her pussy got wet and smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was dripping sweat
But he was all trying to hold his breath
Bake and shake ups
I met this monster in Las Vegas
She said her name was Don-na
She was a? Belt? lil 'monster of Chi-na
I have so much paper that I don't need a ho
You can break, but you can't break me
You never knew a player like Snoop baby "
I knew an asshole named Betty Joe
I took her to my house and we did it on the flo '
The girl got weird, let me tell you more
She is like another monster named Renee
You have her alone and she will brighten your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play.
And with a monster like Renee you can have it your way
These are the tales, the strange tales
These are the stories that I tell so well
These are the tales, the strange tales
Yeah man i heard you wouldn't do it anymore
Finished with? shit nigga I'm not going anywhere
Shit nigga, I'm not going anywhere
Snoop Dogg, this is me
Back in the place to be
I walk a little, I burn a jay
I'm going to baby
Listen closely, let's dream
When things were wrong this time
When am I going to crush get cash
It's all I know, I think the year was '94
Or was it later doesn't really matter
Because it gives me cheese, it gives me cheddar cheese
Funny style, funny niggas
Funny style, funny niggas
They have a fun style yeah Snoop
Disguised motherfuckers what can I say
As soon as I see them when I get up on the spot
Gotti in the building everyone noticed
Looking into my eyes niggas is surprised
What the fuck is cracking? Do not know what is happening?
The next time this nigga gets close, clap your hands
This bitch nigga moves so slow
Just bring the rhythm and let the shit explode
Because Snoop is on the microphone and I came to hit
I don't come to play, I come to drop the heat
And niggas how they dust you on the streets
You're just trying to rap about what you know
And I'm going to keep this shit low
I man my clique me and my crew
We come through this bitch and we hit you
You think you can fuck with us
But I don't think you're kidding us
For 20 years and that's all me
Bitch run around the place
Delivering the blow
Run and get all my nigga money I get
Bitches love me and stay on my dick
I'm rolling with touches, little half [?]
Me and the great Snoop get that bread
Make the lips of the pussy spread
Loving my Mercedes, what a bitch
And let me get closer to these niggas
You can measure me, you can imagine the frame
You can change the beat and you can slow this shit down
You can try to get closer but this is still Dogg Pound
We are fucking, we are smoking the drug
We will be on the tourist bus from coast to coast
Every corner, all my hoes
All my friends, all my souls.
In a second niggas get hit and then it's over
Look, look, why are these niggas stumbling?
On site with my deep friends with heaters
So everyone should know when they stepped forward
You fucked up and that's what happens
DPGC I thought you knew
Ay Dogg, let me holla at'cha man
Are you at home?
Since Dre shook the spear, man
Delicate? Beats?
So is that what you do to me now?
Man I don't give a shit the best
(I hear you Dogg)
(It's a cold, cold thing!)
(It's a cold thing!)
I got more niggas trying to reach me than the president sometimes
You niggas are taking the shit out of your hands, acting too funny
Doing too much, you know, I see it from the first moment
What the hell is wrong with you niggas? They're trying to play a low pro
And trying to be tough and trying to be big stubborn or whatever they call it
I think it's time for me to act like an alcoholic
And I step into the game, I stumble like I don't know
I'm not giving way to try to find myself first
Fifth in the world, but I'll keep my thang together
Because I'm going to keep making money and I hope that everything stays together
Havin papers, man, now what are all the niggas doing?
You all broke in the corner
Drinking your drink, I want to be doing what I'm doing
But don't be mad and don't try to play hate
Because, uh, traveling from one state to another
Representing, uhh, what they want to represent
But they can't represent it because they don't have dollars or cents
I am moving, I am moving and I am moving
Making more movements than the average Cuban
Trying to get G's through the city, trying to make more hits
And trying to squeeze my game and get to your bitch
Now, if she wants to continue with this, she has gone to holla to a player, do '
Because she knows that Snoop Dogg has that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump, bring a friend
Because everything is like the alphabet, enter
Come in and bring a friend and you can come back
Because when you do, let's have a little Cognac
It's on me, I feel good tonight
Cause I'm going to mine and I'm going to hold it all tight
I'm not going to let anything slip, because if things slip, then they catch me
Shit, bitches are cold with a nigga who ain't got his game tight
But I ain't gonna pay no bitch, no no, no way Dogg
I'm too slippery, I'm too tight
I'm sure I'll get away from some shit like dat, right?
You can't be a fake ass, nigga talking about you, you want to be the man
Because if you are not with the game, the game will not be with you
And I can put that in all inclusive you
One in five black men before 2000
Without justice, there is no peace
Yes, the truth hurts, if you are afraid, go to church
Look here, but don't cut it, getting five points
Take a step back for a second, I'm putting less than five in this joint
Hmm, if this is the bomb, blacks will explode like Atlanta at the Olympics
Niggas go crazy but I'll be pimpin
I'm just trying to get money, I'm not even going offline without switches
I leave it with me and make a hit maker, you know what I'm saying?
I love the Lakers now because they now have Shaq O'Neal
Time to make a million dollars and that's real
See we've blown up and popped up and puke nuttin but Dogg Pound
Guaranteed to leave it and we will be close to your city
Or whatever you do, just stay true to what you do
Because we have been doing what we have to do
Now follow me now and listen to the instructions
Cause the game is going to deepen now, niggas is trying to crawl
Trying to get up in the game, but they don't want to be down with the PG
Suddenly everyone wants dis DP
Now how do we see ourselves?
Makin, you reject us, that's not right
I should be mad, but I will stay calm
Relax for a second, spit out some hoes
Stanky Bank is what I have because I'm going to keep it
And no, this is not a damn secret
Yes, we are in dry season.
Niggas looking for a reason
Yes, the truth hurts, we are afraid to go to church
They have me running for my life, I'm jumping doors
As a nigga recoils from me
He turns around and bites the police, hmm
The game recognizes Snoop Dogg too cold, I'm alert
I slide into the back of a garage, diving in with this ho
They run past me and ask "Have I seen the suspect?"
"Yes, he went that way", now for the cat
It's like that, yes, and it doesn't stop.
Now stand on your feet and listen to the heartbeat
Snoop Doggy Dogg is on the microphone I would like to speak, preach
For each and every one, I don't stop
Everyone knows who the baddest rapper is, his name is Doggy Dogg
I get scared and I talk and I preach to you
Cause I'm on the microphone with gray and blue
I am the soft macadamia. Snoop Doggy Dogg, me
Make you jump, pump, pump, grab your cat, but you might feel depressed, hunchback
You can't see me, you want to be me
I got a message for the CPT: Wassup 'Eazy?
You can't see the Dogg because I'm out to check my chin
They call me the super duper, excellent
Hit them, pick them up, spit them out, word
{Verse 1: Nate Dogg}
When I met you last night baby. Before opening your gap. I respected you, madam, but now I take it all away. Because you gave me all your pussy, and you even licked my balls. Leave your number on the cabinet, and I promise you baby I'll call you. Next time I feel a little horny. You can come and I will interrupt you. And if you can't catch that baby saying, just lie down and open your mouth. Because I have never met a girl. That i love all over the world
{Verse 2: Kurupt}
{Hook (4x)}
{Verse 3: Snoop Dogg}
{Verse 4: Warren G}
Look, Kurupt you don't give a shit, Snoop you don't give a shit, so I guess I'll just say I don't give a shit. Because bitches aren't bullshit, but they look like fun when you get to the rap game and make money. But back off bitch because I'm fighting, get on your knees and then start juggling. These MuthaFuckin nuts in your mouth. I am Warren G the black with the influence
For all the Cadillacs niggas.
Ski mask, hit your ass up
We don't give a shit, living in a war zone
Gun packing and we blow on this ozone
I'm riding a shotgun in the fleet with Brome
Motherfucker pop a black cut and ass
I have to rush wars with me and we act wrong
For lil niggas in the Cadillac
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Smoking in an endo let him out of hell out the window
Launch this nigga drama straight into a 1-day Chevy
(Also, he knows how to applaud 2 strippey)
You throw them on the mattress, you call it static preparation
There's no way to solve a nigga, just start spraying
You know I'm in the backseat A'd up, K'd up
He blew shots, blew packages, left the usual
Nigga, fuck you (I'm very professional)
I have a Rolls and a Cadillac, with the heat that I bear
Red ride, black trucks, niggas in ...
For all the Cadillacs niggas.
You better get down, blow your head
We don't give a shit, living in a war zone
Gun packing and we blow on this ozone
Motherfucker pop a black cut and ass
I have to rush wars with me and we act wrong
For lil niggas in the Cadillac
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Yeah damn nigga it's on
For lil niggas in the Cadillac
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Lukes has a gun, it's the way you throw that
Starship stares at a black man on the gold carpet in the back seat
Let's go with the solution, turn around, where is the mass?
I told you I was hungry, don't fuck with me
I cut you like a cake and then I eat you a lot
Drive a light Ferrari and it's me on the streets
Tryna get rich, I'm in one, it's me and my heat
But you're not shit if you're not shit without your home boys
40 niggas missing, we're all tied up
Blokes in the face, The one in the ball caps dog
Dog food on the cock, cat piss in the ashtray
Hit the switch on that foul, let that ass spray
Lukes shooting dime coins peeling in the ashtray
Ski mask, hit your ass up
You better get down, blow your head
I'm riding a shotgun in the fleet with Brome
Motherfucker pop a black cut and ass
I have to rush wars with me and we act wrong
For lil niggas in the Cadillac
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Yeah damn nigga it's on
For lil niggas in the Cadillac
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Fill them to the max and let me get up on my mole
That's what gave my nigga Corey life, another row
My nigga can't speak, so the story is never told
I'm a breakdown for you episode by episode
Look at my uncle in the kitchen putting pots on the stove
The right pimps get drugs in small lines
I was only about 10 or 11 years old
I had to get in fast, it was money in the note
It didn't take long because he really was a spokesperson
See the reason to stand with a handful of hoes
I've paid the price, it goes beyond what you know
Said it was a setup, leave it at some price chance
I'm a damn 2 fucks, you dead motherfuckers
For all the Cadillacs niggas.
You better get down, blow your head
We don't give a shit, living in a war zone
Gun packing and we blow on this ozone
Motherfucker pop a black cut and ass
For lil niggas in the Cadillac
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Yeah damn nigga it's on
Time to slow down, constantly grinding
And this is, the great Doggy Dogg ..
And I'm not talking about any Air Force
I just have to know, before you let me get something
Silk cotton sheer lace, sexy thong
I have to know, or could you show me
Let a nigger sneak in a little, peek-a-boo
Let's see what we can do
I'm about to drive you crazy and sneak away
In a quiet place
Then I can look at him face to face
I can tell, because you like the squat
Your last friend was so rotten
And now your love must be got
But what I'm really trying to do is read between your pantylines
I know it seems so personal
But I'm just trying to make you feel really comfortable
And the kind of underwear you're wearing, I mean, it's bothering me
Can I have a look, one for pimps?
I have a question, answer me then
You came to church full-bodied
Working that lace, I think it was the French cut
Yeah bitch you got a big butt
Now it's very tight, but I have a way to expand it
With a little Miles Davis to put you in the mood like
Zoom boom hit the poom-poom right
Just to have your right rhythm
I can make it happen, but it can't happen if you're not good at it
But it's up to you if you want to go far
Now let me take a look, one for the pimps
I have a question, answer me this
What you will think
It is very difficult
Hard to trust a smile and a face
When niggas have intentions already taking your place
Will you pick me up?
Will you pick me up?
I'm a gangster to my end
Because some people pretend
And there are not many of us that we can call friends
Ohhhhhhh
Now all I have to do is keep my head up
And walk in a straight line when fake friends don't mind
But I'm kind-hearted
And I don't like to be stepped on
If it wasn't real, I wouldn't be in this position
So, dogg, I have a lot to say
I'm alone with my rhymes when we kick it all day
Lil 'Jay used to say it would never be anyone
But do you know what I never do?
Smoke it like Gotti
Five million dollars hit puttin on saxophones
Deee and Snoop tray, sounds good on this microphone
I never threaten anyone to happen
Let me show you how we eat a full meal of this rappin '
But if I had a chance to return it
I'd give it to those who helped me do that
Do that directly from the heart
East side until I die
It's a journey like us Crip
Suppose the enemies still
With both sides of the ride causing a lot of tears
Crazy and 20's both from the same city
Lots of fallen niggas and not that many
I, C and G can think of the beginning
Homies relaxing, taking drugs, throwing dice in the park
And have a heart
To lift them if it were beef
Come up like G's, take it out on the street
So I fucked up and kept a select few
And friend, that's nothing the set can erase
You put me through to the friend, Goldie, even though we've never spoken.
And you, children, my children, so now we are family
Because I could never see you doing wrong without
And that's real
How a game will make your chips sink
Hard to trust a smile and a face
When niggas have intentions already taking your place
Keep your head up and stand up
If I stumble, I will fall
I'm a gangster to my end
Because some people pretend
What can we call friends ...
And don't stop until you have enough
I want to rock with you
Shake your stuff (2x)
Me me doctor
They all hit the floor
Wild until security knocked on the door
I'm dirty
Gorilla legs, hitting the sugar walls
Hoes Want To Pop E, Hang Up With A Dogg
I have a doughless ho with condoms with it
Look at it crooked
Steal and squirt
Funk in the Cadillac truck with a chicken, swinging his neck
You called Hugh Heffer to find the monsters
I will stay on the street
I'll keep saying 'fuck you' behind the police
My mom is not stupid, she loves me
I'm a jump, hit, throw that ass
Hard sex, I have to fuck with shoulder pads
Not nann ho get butter from redman
And my man Gutter, DJ Murder Inc
Under the heat, yeah, I keep buzzing
Methamphetamine, show them where the luger was kept
Open your safe, show me where the food and the vest are
I hope when Dre hears this, he hits for ten more
Cause I stand in the corner like squegeemen
Yo Nate Dogg, what's going on?
Long Beach, Brick City
Yell at your frog
All trembling
All these hoes around me
I was lost in the land of love
I'm glad Nate Dogg found me
Girl you got a phatty
New York back to Cali
Long Beach to Brick City
I know I just want you to want, I just want you to need
Turn that shit upside down and back me up
Since I was the first, I think I will be the last to go
D-O-double-G, will you keep him gangsta please?
I have to do it
Yes yes we keep the best smoke
Me and my nigga, my nerve, my family
I kick his ass and then I smoke
I'm a fool in the pool doing the chest beat
Because if not, I came to the disco
And drive this ho from Acopoqo crazy
And flip it upside down, now I'm about to ride
Come on, we hit the hood slowly
Publish, configure store and press four
Who got the best flow, who got the most mass
Who has the best hoes, nigga, you know?
Shit, it's been ten years since I hit some smoke
But I still wear a bad coat on the west coast
And I crumble mine to the dandelion
Nigga watch how I handle mine
Spiritual, listen let's go, listen to this
Snoop D-O-double-G, man, I'm so brave
Square biz, you know what time is it
I'm great with these niggas but I'm tough on a bitch
Now check dis, the fact is
Get your back out, now come back in
Go shake your head, you're feeling me now
Girlfriend, you're killing them now
The way you shake your loot
Makes me want your loot
The way you shake your loot
Fa dizziness shizzle, it's the great Neptizzle
With the Snoopy D-O-Double Gizzle!
... (Snoop Dogg!)
W-walk towards this (Snoop Dogg!)
Hehe, yeah, C-walk to this (Snoop Dogg!)
A-ha-ha! W-walk towards this (Snoop Dogg!)
Guess who enters, with them Baby Blue Chucks.
I'm still in these beats and I keep a bad bitch on the streets
The biggest dog of all, and you are a flea
And since I have time to drop it for you, I guess I should
And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust
I keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust
And none of you can fuck with us
But you can run in the G but that's not thinking wisely
These thrillers are "contagious", just like Ron Isley
What the hell is going on? Someone is sleeping in my house
Snoop to the D-O-Double G (uh-huh)
Who is the man with that dance? (Snoop Dogg!)
Who keeps the khaki pants for all his pants? (Snoop Dogg!)
Hold the bass-bass in a three-wheeled position (Snoop Dogg!)
I do it for the G's and I do it for the scammers
Here to annihilate them
Eff the police because all they want to do is handcuff us
The world is fucking cold like his name was Usher
But I keep getting rid of llacs, making them G stacks
And I carried them on my back
I'm not really trying to be picky
But if you give me something, it has to be the sticky one
Green for ounces, low-low bounces
Sandy Fay and Annie Mae kissing on my couch and
Ooh a la ouch y, Moet source
This is how we got to the Doggy Dogg House'n
This year we are not fucking with thousands
Stop at Doggy Dogg Palace
With a car, fulla bitches cook semolina like Alice (oh!)

Nigga this, nigga that, we do this, we do that
Talking about that shit will give you back your wig
You knew that, we do that, how it's supposed to be done
It would be fun if you didn't have a gun
But if you didn't have one, you would probably run; come come
Now spit it out from the tip of your tongue, a little wisdom
It gives them something to move around
The next time you see me again gangsta'd
The chilling wit of my hat had many friends again
In b-ball, soccer, baseball, the penetentianary, the cemetery
The church house and dining room
Flawless, yiggy yeah, everyone plays them from above
Show great love, keep the crippin 'alive
In addition to dubbing, push come push
Everyone knows how it all went

But niggas still talk about me (talk about me)

Let's go to the moving sounds
I'm trying to bring you down
And put a little soul in your butt Like James Brown (ay!)
I feel good now; Can you feel that
It's like going back, I thought I should share it
Compare dat, and 'use dat 7 days a week
Keep my name in your mouth
And my business goes down the damn streets
You're a fucking geek
Although I should, but
(Chorus)
Yes
Bee-yah

So glassy eyes
Bitch at the club, try to harass me
I am a taxi

Dancing abroad, nigga, I'm heavy there
Leaning to one side, mixing all the drinks.
Fold here, like a gold mink
This long beach bitch, d-o-double-g
Look at your gaze mayne, the gaze worsens
I understand that I am famous, but first I am a gangster
You better hit Mayne, I'll hit him fast
I'm off the wall, bitch, I'm full of that shit
I have my rag hanging, like Snoopy does
Sounds like an enemy, like Snoopy, who?
All friends niggas deep as shit

Mac Retailer in Defense of the Honorable Snoop Dogg
On the court of the game. With false charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 227 accounts
From flexing your G's, busting your P's
Dotting their I's and crossing their T's
The anti player has presented and sent an alpha certificate.
On the court of the game. With false charges against
My client Snoop Dogg, Tha Doggfather - for 357 counts
Of verbal and reckless danger
From the million dollar mouthpiece;
And leaving these super sap shoots
Decombobulated, confused and shaken, like a pair of dice
The anti-player has presented and sent an "alpha" certificate
On the court of the game. Loading my client Snoop Dogg
Tha Doggfather - to distribute and make games
Crossing state and county lines, with the intention of improving the system
Now if you want to judge Tha Doggfather
Bring it before 12 G and open your files
And you will see that since Snoopy was a puppy
His tail was up, ready to shake the bell and roll.
And charge a henchman a ho for his pension
So all of you shake with them $ 11 words
About a multi-million dollar crypto
Who has the mind of a man of good will, the heart of a tyrant?
And the tongue of a mack - I said
While you fool is looking for stripes
To grant a motion, of 995 - grounds, for dismissal
When I met you last night, baby
Before opening your gap
I respect you lady
But now I get it all back
And I promise you baby, I'll call you
Next time i feel a little hot
Can you come
Just lie down and open your mouth
Cause I've never met a girl
Well if Kurupt cared about a bitch, he would always be broke
I'd never have a motherfucker to smoke
Bitch, you can't make me
Do we look alike BBD, hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
To pay this just to put this ho
I know the pussy is mine
So I'm going to fuck a few more times
And then I'm done
There is nothing more to do with it.
Pass it to the friend, now you hit it
Cause she's just a bitch to me
And you know that bitches ain't shit to me
I don't give a shit
Why don't they pay attention?
Approach her with a different proposal
I'm Kurupt ho
You'll never be my only bitch trick
It's not fun if friends can't have any
Guess who back in the fucking house
With a fat cock for your damn mouth
Hoes recognize, niggas too
Because when the bitches get rowdy and throw a voodoo
What are you going to do?
You really don't know
So I advise you not to trust that
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing very well, I'm too caught up in my grip
How many bitches want to fuck this black called Snoop?
Puppy, I'm all of the above
I'm too fast to catch up on your hoes
But look, it's not fun
If my friends can't prove it
Because you know i don't love them
Hey now you know
Three to get ready and four to press the switches
In my Chevy, '64 - red to be exact
With bitches on my side and bitches on my back
So get on your knees and then start juggling
These damn nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G, the black with the influence
It's not fun if friends can't have any

Keep your eyes on your enemies, look at those who are near you
See them outside, niggas can't touch you
Smiling at your face but I want to take your place
Fuck you and be a beach, let's make a deal with the D.A
Don't go without niggas
Because it only takes a fraction of a second
To get your money and go to bed
Hesitation will buy you fate, catch that butt
Ya little homey could be great
Remember you took time to kill Smash and you don't give a shit

Gangsta
This is a public service announcement.
Now sure, sure, you're broken, sure, sure, you have your problems
Here's something about a nigger like me "What is that?"
He should never have let me out of the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg, I would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker when I'm playing with my A.K
Since I was young, I smoked weed
Smoking you and your crew, taking a life or two
This is my gang, nigga, no limit
My nigga C is gonna fuck you up in a minute
With the pow pow, bang bang (* shots *) and you're dead
And then we stamp that tank on your forehead
Every time we go they say "Damn it"
And then you realize we don't care
We don't just say no, we're busy saying 'síaaahhhhhh
Do I look like a damn role model?
To a child looking at me
Shit, life is nothing but grass and money
Fuck me or C and I'll put your foot in your ass
I don't give a shit because I keep selling
What the hell are the screams?
"Gangsta gangsta" that's what they scream
"Gangsta gangsta" that's what they scream
Niggas living loud and stick with it, with that
"Gangsta gangsta" that's what they're selling
Bitches buy it straight 'cause they love that straight G shit
Homies all standing just hanging
Some drug dealers, some gangsters "What's up nigga?"
Seen a nigga in Dayton, so we crawled
Very slow, and before you know it
I had my double aim on your window
He got scared and hit the gas "Damn"
At that time, I knew I had to smoke his butt
It kept rolling, I jumped into the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck him
Then we head back to Snukes
With seven niggas on a Navs, are you going crazy?
I was scared and it was showing
So we all said "FucK YOU Bitch" and we kept rolling
For the hood, now we were ending
Find something else to enter
Like a pussy, or indeed
Get loud, shit, but we call it rat pack
In a nigga don't follow anything
Snoop Dogg Goes Ignorant When I'm Fucking With My Tank Dogs

He represents the tank, but difficult to hit.
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit

Nigga tried to touch me close and got punched in the mouth
The Fed tried to catch me, you know some enemies
I said "see you later" I jumped in the browser
$ 50 on the back with a navy blue upper
Cause I'm the dumb C, slang and Snoop bang
And I'll smoke a motherfucker like it's nothing
For all my bitches, I know you're kidding with my crew
"We want to fuck you C"
You see, niggas without limit don't take anything
So let me tell you motherfuckers that you're fucking with
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's quick to explode
If you fuck with me, I'm gonna smoke your butt
I don't give a shit because No Limit keeps selling
Now tell me, what the hell are they screaming?
"Gangsta gangsta" that's what they scream
"Gangsta gangsta" that's what they're selling
Bitches want to buy it 'cause they love that shit G
If only you stayed down and you had been the true partner of the motherfuckers
You wouldn't have had that problem
But look how you want to jump off the ship and you thought the ship would sink
A motherfucker without becoming a submarine
Now you have no paper, and now you are in a paper caper
Now, you come to my face and say: Hey, can I hang out?
Now I'm tired of all these silly paper whores chasing paper whores
Uhh, this has been a public service announcement from No Limit Records.

We can do ours but you can't be a wife
Go and let your puppy give you a bone
At the end of the night I will take you home)
I have two friends, we can have group sex
(Blaow!) 2-1 nigga
Let's say I make great songs
My nasty video made her do porn
And she goes far
I still can't believe I'm talking to a real star
Pop told me very hard
And he threw that shot back really hard
The royal penis is clean, I am the king like the boulevard
Dogg does his thing, made her feel like a superstar
Do you want to share your feelings with your friends?
And she says I made her fall in love
I had to shake it fast like I wasn't when I was
I got my game from the streets, I never went for a monster
I had the nerve to ask for money when I hit him
I looked at the bitch like cut, dat-dat-dat
I have never met another gangsta like you
I'm not really sure, but I think I'd like to
(Girl, you will never meet a gangsta like me
We can do ours but you can't be a wife
Go and let your puppy give you a bone
Friends say don't do it
You will always have to do it with her
She creeps into your hotel, saying she won't say
Know that one night will not serve you
(No) you know i got that gangsta
Make you want to say to my mom "thank you"
So give me all your paper, every time I put you to bed
Seeing a bad bitch is like a fat Rome
I have one but you know I have to grab it
So, mom, what's going on?
Let me know if you're trying to break it
Do you want to relax when you go down for success?
Ms. American Gangsta, Mr. Blue Magic

That's what it's about
Call them stop them
Fuck, I turn them
The hard one never listens
I'm staying G, and by the way I mentioned ... young black man
Dogg Pound just for the pleasure of doing it (D-P-G ... Dogg Pound!)
Born gangsta, keeping it true
None of you can stop me now
Because now I have papers (Get money, get money ... Dogg Pound!)
A-B-C-D-P-G-C
No L-I-M-I-to the T (No limit)
I'm fucking wit G's who's moving with thugs
You still catch me hanging out
At the muthafuckin club
One love (One love, nigga!), Drinking Moet
All because of my loneliness, because I don't give a shit
And no one will fuck with me
Because I'm a Tru Tank Dogg
With a big bank, you
Let's try Snoop and see us whip them again (Woo!)
Stay high, stay on top
I'm number 1 with a bullet and I'm back on top (Back on top!)
(Say what?) One hundred tests, gold tooth with the diamond in the middle
Stay independent on a mission
By the way did I mention it? (Keep it gangsta, nigga!)
Born gangsta, keeps moving (keep going, keep going)
Dogg Pound just for the pleasure of doing it (D-P-G ... Dogg Pound!)
Born gangsta keeping it true (Keep it real, dawg)
None of you can stop me now (Yes, stop that)
Born gangsta, keep moving (keep moving, keep going)
Because now I have papers (Yes ... Dogg Pound! You know!)
Yes, yes, another Dogg House production. My black meech on the beat. I have another smoke session inside the doghouse
I gotta say wussup to all my niggas in the house right now
My black meech in the house
Yes, AGB Chop-Chop
Yes, GoldieLox
LBC
Warren g
Aww yeah
LBC's Kiddie Banks
JC
Aww yeah
From the great LB
This is how we do it, DPG
And we went out ...
It's a gangsta gangsta ride
On the walnut danger side
As we ride, we dive and glide
Take your mind high
It's a gangsta gangsta ride
On the walnut danger side
As we ride, we dive and glide
Take your mind high
Me me, from that black DPG to CP3
Back to the house, from east to west
Now take it back south
If I go crazy, you're glad the niggas get mad then hit the flo '
Gotta pack something wet, so I hit the sto '
In winter it's the Hummer for the summer it's six-fo '
I got niggas mad at me (why?) 'Cause they can't get no six
Bitches are mad at me (why?) 'Cause they can't get no dick
I'm going to be on top of the game whether I'm bankrupt or rich
I don't stop once I'm up, I just drop more punches
I'm in the club with the thug, I just blew up 'Crist'
Tell Snoop to bring the Coupe his new shit, I just have to go get it
Tell all women with watery eyes that they get offended too much
Because I don't deport any girl
They all blame a bunch of kids, so I have to roll my Adidas
It's a gangsta gangsta ride
On the walnut danger side
As we ride, we dive and glide
It's a gangsta gangsta ride
As we ride, we dive and glide
Boom bam when I get into the jam damn
I don't need an introduction, because you know who I am
The S-N-double-O-P, the only one, for 'sho'
Now motherfuckers, let me hear you say ho
I spit on you, I spit on you, whoot wham, I catch you
Rider, I threw a slipper at you, right at you
Mash ya, gat ya, drip ax
Keep up the crackin 'party, while I'm constantly rappin'
This game that we run, you know what is happening
I'm sliding south with a punch to the mouth
I take a plane east and try to make amends
I'm hanging with my niggas on the projects
The friend is having a party, I have to go back to the west
Oh yes it's true we are the best
No Limit DPG Southwest connects, can you feel me?
It's a gangsta gangsta ride
On the walnut danger side
Take your mind high
It's a gangsta gangsta ride
On the walnut danger side
As we ride, we dive and glide
Stay gang member
Keep it gangsta, keep it gangsta dogg
Keep it, keep it gangsta dogg
Yeah we keep it gangsta dogg
For 'sho', we keep it gangsta dogg, what?
Yeah i mean what about all those gangstas
Out there on the Eastisde
You all niggas need to point the guns in the right direction
You know, have you heard?
It's a gangsta gangsta ride
On the walnut danger side
As we ride, we dive and glide
Take your mind high
On the walnut danger side
As we ride, we dive and glide
Take your mind high
It's a gangsta gangsta ride
On the walnut danger side
As we ride, we dive and glide
All I want to do is make the whole crowd bounce ...
Instructions for this game, it is instinct mixed with knowledge
I'm a gamer in the game and I don't know about college
Eyes wide open, focus, scanning the scene
Look closely at gangsta haters because they are worse than drug addicts
Because I'm going to make things better for me
The L-L-G with DPG by the sea
Let me tell you as long as my voice is recordable
That plan you have is not going to work better for you audible
With persistence, I proceed
Providing you with what you need, there's no room for greed
Don't bite off more than you can chew
Respect the game and the game will respect you.
Without the coastal juggling
(Will you get mad and take out your gun?)
And put it back together and still be stronger than leather
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce
T Lee, hold 'em, shake' em, roll
Libra puts it all over the world
I will eat your soul in my dog bowl, I will bark when it gets dark
Bitches in heat break the beating, what?
In the microphone I bury the bone
Uhh, to get the party pooper out, why? They fall doo-doo
I'm trampling shit, I lift the bottom of my shoe
See I'm tearing up all the ingenuity without a leash
When I move, I make marks across the street
See, I'm cruel as hell, I've got them moving
For LBC bow-wow style
In the receiver, go find him like a retriever
Wit the mizzic, look, I let the Doggz loose on them
Look at this here man, lick them, make them sick
Man's best friend, I hit you for ten, uhh
Fleas can't get hold of my backpack, what is my name?
Great trick we're hitting like the Doberman gang
You took a trip and tried to fuck me since I was a puppy
A cat runs through a tree, nigga, it's DPG
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce
They say there was once in the land of the locomotives
Where it comes to drugs and gun smoke
He packs me a heavy .38 caliber revolver
Snoop with the .44 knocking on the door
We are the passion to crush and mashin the masses
Hitting niggas like Cassius, killer of Dogg Pound Gangsta
It's like in an action
Because of the cash in my own area that we know from blastin
We don't argue, we stay about 10 inches and then bust
Close enough to touch and then run
Clean and radical and get clutch
Release the D-O-Double G with the solid gold bone
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce
Just keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce
Introduction:
Now you're back at checkout, this is DJ, Eazy Dick
In W-Balls, right now, something new, by Snoop Doggy Dogg
And this one is for the ladies, of all the boys.
A big bow wow wow, cause we'll make it a little mystery
Here tonight, this is DJ Eazy Dick, at the station that
He slaps you on the fat ass with a fat cock
Verse one: Nate Dogg
But now I get it all back
Because you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise you baby, I'll call you
Next time i feel a little horny
You can come and I'll interrupt you
And if you can't fuck, that day, baby
Just lie down and open your mouth
Around the world
Verse two: Kurupt
Well if Kurupt cared about a whore, he would always be broke
Drive me crazy and looney bitch you can't make me
I have no love for hoes
That's something I learned in the pound
So how the hell am I supposed
To pay this hoe, just to put this hoe
I know the kitty mines, I'm going to fuck a few more times
And then I'm done, there's nothing more to do with it
Pass it to the friend, now you hit it
Cause she's nothing but a bitch to me
And you know, those bitches ain't shit to me
I don't give a shit, why don't you pay attention?
Chorus: (repeat 4X)
It's no fun, if friends can't have any
Verse Three: Snoop Doggy Dogg
Guess who back in the fucking house
Hoes recognize, niggas too
Because when the bitches run out of skan and make a voodoo
So I advise you not to trust that hoe
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing very well, I'm too caught up in my grip
Now as the sun turns and my game gets bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this black called Snoop?
I'm too fast to catch up on your hoes
Because you know i don't love them
Verse four: Warren G
Whoa!
Hey, now you know, inhale, exhale with my flow
One for the money, two for the bitches
In my Chevy, six fo 'Rad to be exact
On your knees and then start making jugglin
These damn nuts in your mouth
It's me, Warren G, the black with the influence
Whoo!
Now $ hort! I know you didn't think that shit was over
Nothing can save you
No love, $ hort (4x)
Now mickity mic down
Pistols, mothafuckas
Lowin 'the holes
It's the boy by the gutter
Punks wear ribbons
And they sound so real
But the real niggas don't come into court and they scream
Yeah look at all that Racia punk shit
Like a bitch, little snitch
He made me with that!
The court is in session, $ hort
And you have been accused
And you have no love for the sewer
See we remember when you had to have
A baserock cawy and a nice hot bath
Smokin 'and chokin', Sir Too $ hort
Just thinking about the day before
See you should never fuck
With the real killa
I enter you, silly black friend
I got on the microphone and he called me punk
And funk is what you want
Dirty, tired, fucked up
And I take my foot off her ass
Let's ride, mob, fuck talking bad
No punk let me check mate
I will not burst you
I'd rather go up and let you fall
But the rappin is weak shit
And I'm down with this street shit
The ugliest nigga in rap
Try to limit the black
From the damn hood
So when I see you everything is fine
Too much $ hort ...
Nothing can save you
No love, $ hort (4x)
I tackled your butt last year
But you didn't hear me mass
They are 94 and the banks need a little more
Lips that look delicious
Digidy down goes my zipper
Nigga, can you suck on this
And you must like cocks
Why do you ride with the tip of $ hort
Like a funny little bitch
Ridin 'around in your too $ hort-hand-me-down
I left the dangerous crew
And that's why you're clowning now
Bigidy Banksta is not gigidy gigidy gangsta
When the truth is out, you're not bullshit, but a joke
Try hanging on my hood looking out of place
With that blank look on your face:
Now get in where you fit, piece
So I'm not giving any rules
Assume you want some damn funk
Then bring it to the crew
So bring it if your butt wants to trip
And to this hollow point, bitch
To hell with that ass, yes I would
Because on the streets, nigga, everything is fine
Too much $ hort ...
Nothing can save you
No love, $ hort
Oh there goes my pager
And she's your bitch, I think it's better to fade her
The light skinned bitch got too hot
It's going down, the pannies come out
Another hobo bitch roasts automatically
I think you found out and got jealous
Because I was digging your bitch
But you took her home
And I wanted to marry the bitch
I'd dig her into this, sir
And bury the bitch
Stop spending all your money and fix your teeth
$ hort Dog must like to be ugly
Came to a bad nigga
Small cavity creeps walking with Nikes on
Because I did funk with the best
So when you ride your lexus
Nigga put on your vest
And stay out of my neighborhood
Because death is a factor and everything is fine
Nothing can save you
No love, $ hort (4x)
Snoop Dogg, C-Murder, and Silkk the Shocker
Unlimited (biatch)
Ride with g's
And send keys abroad for all three
Watch my enemies
Snoop and silk
At the back of the lake
With that AK
In a blue tint, with an infared
Motherfucker is going to die tonight
So I smoke weed, I take drugs tonight
Because I am a soldier without limit
With TRU tattooed in blood
Murda murda, kill kill
If you put me in danger
I'm a tank rep until it's history
Turning Playa Hatas into a damn memory of mother
So throw them away if you're a soldier
And Snoop Dogg passes the damn mother dolja
C-murder won't die, until a nigga bitch kills me
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
It's not junior personal nut'in
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
Keep my warmth on the board
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
It's not junior personal nut'in
Look, it's all about respect
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
I'm never caught slipping
Keep my warmth on the board
Now how many niggas do you know can fuck?
And die and come back
But I am so hated by the beach
And I've been reinstalled
And I thank God that I finally made it
Destined for a lot of niggas, just to get one back
Remember I'm that young black man
Never craps, just five duices
Mix that Moet, white star, with them orange juices
I hang out with real niggas
Like Silkk and C-Murder
TRU niggas, niggas
Like you niggas
Ghetto ass, lower class
Never hesitate to shoot
And I'm so serious about my hustlin
I have to have my cash
Shit, I wouldn't be bustin without raps
I wish I had my leash running to your door
Taking all your dough, your gold and your cars
'Cause big Snoop Dogg, there's no mother damn rap star
See ima gangsta (gangsta) and you a notch (you're a notch)
I'm wrapped up in the fatigue of my army
Blowing on the green trees
In the browser, and keep warm for them beach hatas
Kill-kill-kill
Murda-murda-murda
It's not junior personal nut'in
Murda-murda-murda
I'm never caught slipping
Murda-murda-murda
Look, it's all about respect
Murda-murda-murda
I'm never caught slipping
Keep my warmth on the board
Now look at murda, murda, murda
And this kills, kills, kills
Stay tied and covered, to peel off
And mom always told me
You're not a mother fucking soldier
There is no limit tattooed on my back and my stomach
Cause I'm a fucking dumb mother
Uhhh, show me love
Because when I make music with thugs, I make movements
Well i'm going out hard
Seen this guy called van
I bring the pain
See everyone coming out stars
In da house thinking about loop
I said to the blacks
Rap shit is not bad, I exploit them, so I ask them, I shoot
If your a trip
I told you I was doing this shit on bail (that's great)
And look, I'm a black, I'm going to hang like a black
Hit that shit like it was smooth and blood
Now hand out weed nigga
You can't hold me
Don't even trip over my black snoop
If you are a soldier now
Do what you think, bitch
For this tank bitch
And I have no limits scattered on my fucking forehead
This is why I do so much dirt
Late night hanging around the corner (Gangsta, Gangsta, Gangsta)
East Long Beach, California
Daytonas when I run to you
Real dog, bitch, try to catch a boner
I get what I get, I'm a goner
And smoke more drugs than a stoner
I sip what I sip when I sip
Don't turn around when I trip over a bitch, cause I'm in a
Get your ass out for the money ...
Snoop Dogg came back for your butt
Grass and trees, ass up, bitch, on your knees
Do what I please
Take her, make her get more
Even if she never sold her pussy hole before
It is a slow process
Rub my fingers on your dress
Hold these nuts, it's a test
Hide this package in your breasts
Don't say no, always say yes
You are my best
Oh yes, what does he do?
So I wrote this song for you
All my bitches, all my hoes
Flies, tight, and even white.
All my bitches, all my hoes
All my bitches, all my hoes
Don't say shit, bitch, keep it low
For the Dogg protocol, you know
They won't catch me, I'll refuse
A nigga just chose, so I choose you
I'm not really trying to confuse you, abuse you or abuse you
It's back to the bed frame
PI. real all in your head game
I have the bitch with the most ass
She is a lawyer with a visa
And that's what he does
So I wrote this song for you
Heavenly Father, I want to thank you for what you have done for me
In my life, I try so hard to be faithful, and I am faithful to you
And my soul just runs away to you, and I want you to hold my hand and hold me
I know, I know, I know
One of these days, I'm going to run away to you
Yes I am
Make me want to run away
On my knees in the night, I pray
You always have something to say
In the kitchen with my relatives, cooking
They say the devil always appears when you're not looking
So I am doing the work of God.
I'll hook them with the writing
Then bring everything to life so everyone can get an idea
See this is for my friends who hold the fence
Preachers, ministers, deacons, ushers, and sisters (what?)
My grandmother used to say "Give us our daily bread"
She put it in my heart, and now it's in my head
Make me want to run away
That we will live another day
I'm in the park, playing ball with the kids
Provide the garter so that it can help restore the feeling.
It's a blessing to give back, so let's keep giving it
Walk by faith and show how we live it (Livin ')
Loving him, avoiding hate
Yell at Ruth for giving birth to Nate
That's my boy's mom
We carry God with us
Do the right thing, don't fight
Or try to fight us
And that's a fact, right
The gospel
Sitting in the corner, trying to imagine the fall
You've finished too high, now you feel so low
I'm just a nobody, I try to tell everyone
About someone who can save anyone
Make me want to run away
On my knees in the night, I pray
That we will live another day
Ya uh
Once they told me
You get your freedom
By letting your enemy know that
You will do anything to get your freedom
Then you will get it
When you have that kind of attitude
Or they just call you a crazy crazy
They don't say black
Or they'll call you an extremist
Or a subversive
Or a state
Or a red or radical
But when you stay radical long enough
And make you like enough people
You will get your freedom
So they weren't around here
Trying to make friends
With someone who is depriving
You of your rights
They are not your friends
And treat them like this
And fight them
And you will get your freedom
And after you have your freedom
Because I have no hatred in me
If you want to know what I will do
Find out what you will do
And i will do the same
(damn ... shit)
Yes, this Christmas of pimps
Yes, this Christmas of pimps

I'm trying to break a bitch until I get my money right
You know I'm extra tight, I'm taking hella flight
Around the world, around the world

But they do the same
Artistic as it gets is great Snoop Dogg
So throw a pawn to the grass
And let me show you how it's supposed to be
Explode like a bomb, napalm
Let me show you what it's supposed to be
Now come closer to me, these are edible
File them in the closet, stab him, let him go
This is my art form, I am so original
Like Ice-T, but I don't drip, I fall to the ground
Get a ho, get the door
Let them know from the door
Here we go let it ride
Snoopy D-O-double-G, Eastside LBC
Look at the sky

All the girls in this room.

Damn, a nigga only got $ 20 shit
watch this
Nigga 20 bucks to my name
Deep in this dice game
I fucked two g's
There is nothing left to do, but buy some shells for my Glock
Why? in order to steal all known drug points
I'm having tough times, guts and grinding
Shit I'm trying to get mine
There's nothing to lose, plus I'm living on the front line
It's a cold twist how the shit goes
I gotta keep your hands on a fucking fetish
And keep a bitch depressed for when your money runs out
And shoot them until they come out
I'm blowing in the wind
Silkk brought the Gin & Juice and my nigga participated
I'm among murderers with a dub in my pocket
But if I wasn't in this rap game
Would a black Snoop Dogg have $ 20 in my name?
And all we are now are gangsters and thugs
If my yale does not sell, how will we proceed?
Why can't we say the urb
Because we smoke a lot of weed
And all we are now are gangsters and thugs
If my yale does not sell, how will we proceed?
Why can't we say the urb
Because we smoke a lot of weed
I have 19 dollars and 50 cents in my pocket with what?
With this automatic rocket
I have to take it out, unlock it and take me hostage
Let me now that this itch on my finger is worse than jock itch
Deleting tips from lips-busting cops and sisters, stop this
Soda couldn't move this
My [?] Can't cut this
Look at this here with a hole
It allowed the silencer to explode
Now with these last 20 dollars you could buy me some douja
I saw my nigga nigga for a long time
He and I used to lift and move a rented Cadillac
He sees my nick, he sees my grill, he says I'm flossing
He sees my doll, he says damn nigga, you're flossing
And I'm the boss, and I throw them at the same time
So if you think with me, will it be your death in ???
And why put your life in danger for more than 20 dollars, that's all I have
And my weed habit is so close to smoking powder it's not worth it
Shooting
Now $ 20 to my name in this drug game
Why can't we say the urb
Because we smoke a lot of weed
Now $ 20 to my name in this drug game
And all we are now are gangsters and thugs
If my yale does not sell, how will we proceed?
Why can't we say the urb
Now look, I just got out of jail, it feels good to be out
I had $ 120, but I spent $ 100 on my trip
Now all I have left is $ 20 in my name
Nigga wants a damn caine in front of me
Nigga now now I gotta be in a shit murder
Some dump shit Some dumb shit projects
A little marijuana and blunt shit some I don't give a shit
Where the shit comes from Some lonely penitentiaries
The running of the bulls never sees any shit from the sun
Door Now, be it rapping, kidnapping, kidnapping or shooting
It's just a hustle and bustle to eat
I have to get my hustle
In Got 20 bucks, all of you now that shit don't last long imagine this
(Snoop Dogg inhaling)
It's the big boss's dog, Snoop D-oh-double-G
And let yourself relax
Yes this album number nine
I call it Ego Trippin '
Fo 'shiggadal
I'm not going crazy, but doing it
I know, I know, I know
I know they're tripping over how I'm doing my bully that on TV
But I never forget what I love the most, and that's making music
So I hope you enjoy this shit here
Oh yeah! Stay tuned for QDT
Oh my nigga Terrance Martin in this motherfucker too
Oh, press homey play!
Right now, now, now, now, now.
Back in the days on Linden Boulevard
Used to come with the tools and Glocks
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigger for his shoes and socks
Used to come with the tools and Glocks
The party doesn't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigger for his shoes and socks
Standing amazing, hit you in the brain
Put it on stage, maybe even on the front page
Get a little fortune, have a little fame
Kill them with class, toast the boogie as you fill your glass
With my gangster ass, twenty
I used to pinch pennies
Just Gs, I don't fuck without whistles
My clique is sick, it's expanding
What you gonna do
When do we approach a bell near you?
You know
Used to come with the tools and Glocks
The party doesn't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigger for his shoes and socks
Used to come with the tools and Glocks
I beat a nigger for his shoes and socks
What is beef? Because the meat is in the kitchen
What do you want dog I'm on a million dollar mission
How can you get it if you haven't been through shit?
I'm just a seed that was implanted by Ruthless
My family tree is so G, they cut us from the cloth called LBC
Crybaby, used to walk in C in the park
Pitbulls on a leash that would never bark
Trip Locc, kinfolk and Wayniac
"Duces' n Trayz: the old way"
Used to come with the tools and Glocks
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigger for his shoes and socks
Used to come with the tools and Glocks
The party doesn't rock like it used to rock
Back door, nigga, I refuse to knock
I beat a nigger for his shoes and socks
Yes, certified gangsta official shit
No filter, like a pack of humps, black
To the detriment of all who disrespect or deviate from G calls
It's the pig state or the buster state
There is nothing in between
You can't wake up and put this on, nigga
Every breath you breathe must be committed to this shit
It is all part of that lifestyle we created in the past for the world to follow.
Gs up, forever
The chief dogg an 'Tha General, front line and on the east side
High speed chase, 405 is the highway
Slangin 'my- bangin' my- swangin 'my Coupe de Ville
So, back up the hill
Roll in my hand with a trunk full of contraband
Swimming underwater like Aquaman
I used to drink gin, now it's vodka, man
Boss Dawg is the gamer, not the propagandist
I'm going to blow up your gang, don't try to stop the plan
Spaced, caked, without bug-a-boo
Crazed, crazed, nigga, what does he really do?
Time brings changes, so I changed my name
Tryna takes flight as they trim my wings
Group niggas, I see you stumble again
With nothing to gain, plop plop, pop and bang
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-puncher, pimp-puncher
I'm not trying to act, I don't want to act
My nigga backs up, nigga backs up (yeah backs up)
Yeah baby back up baby back up
My nigga go back, nigga go back (go back)
Hi Scoop DeVille, get on the track
Thirty days later I return to the streets
I have a beach lot of bombs, shit, I'm trying to eat
Feet to the pavement; money, I long for it
What about the Dogg bitches? Are you saving them
Can a blind man see? (No)
Can a shark survive out of the water for a week? (No)
A snitch is a snitch if she speaks solemnly
I don't know anything close, I am a product of the beach.
To each his own, hard as stone
Many niggas fight as hard as the foam
Too bad, trying to sneak Tamika's phone
Step back nephew or feel the heat of chrome
G-ma and PawPaw and the heat of my comb
Plate full of shit nigga, I never eat it alone
Heat it up alone, then put the herb on the bong
Take a step back at the foot of my mothafucka throne
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Tip-puncher, pimp-puncher
My nigga backs up, nigga backs up (yeah backs up)
Yeah baby back up baby back up
My nigga go back, nigga go back (go back)
Hi Scoop DeVille, get on the track
Cinematic, back to that
Talk the road and walk on that static
I'm the extra dramatic
When he returned, everyone scattered, it didn't matter
Movin 'heavyweights, Klitschko
We are the funk that killed the disco
I taught you how to go and get this dough
But don't thank me, that's how the shit goes
It's still hitting Crypto since the introduction
Nigga what did they hide?
Wait, who's that trying to get through?
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-puncher, pimp-puncher
I'm not trying to act, I don't want to act
My nigga backs up, nigga backs up (yeah backs up)
Yeah baby back up baby back up
My nigga go back, nigga go back (go back)
Hi Scoop DeVille, get on the track
Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine
Get yours, I take mine
Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine
Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-puncher, pimp-puncher

My nigga backs up, nigga backs up (yeah backs up)
Yeah baby back up baby back up
My nigga go back, nigga go back (go back)
Hi Scoop DeVille, get on the track

Hit your head in the morning I had a crack-a-lackin nigga
I know he'll have some bomb hoes tonight
But I have to do this job, not stumble, the Loc is in one
Watch me get this cake and break bread with my little son
He tried some of the money he was making
Stumbling on my tricks now watch how they behave
Sit down, jump, walk ...
Now shake the park when the shit gets dark
Because that's the one that will be bomb like this and that
Don't be mad when I call my little bitch a hoodrat
(Snoop Dogg: You know what? Kiss me and I'll kiss you back)
But she'll pay me, OG, bye
They'll be in the shit most of the time
Let's go to the hotel and let's go down
This is how a pimp player does it like this
I met you at the club so it couldn't be love
And now you want to get in my bathtub and wash your back
From Snoop D-O-dub? Haha
Wait, put your clothes on
Bitch, you're not about to get your dough
Go to the kitchen and hook me something to eat
And put the TV on BET
Break the blinds and throw me a LA Times
And bring me some orange juice with the ice in the cup
I know I'm demanding
But I'm a motherfucker and I don't give a shit
And when I get up in the morning, bitch, you know what happens
You are the sweetest hoe I know
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
You're gonna be my backup hoe (Ha ha ha ha)
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
You're going to be my backup hoe

If we have problems, we will destroy them
Shake them, cause they can't hold me
Cheer up, nigga tear da club up
If you are not going to get noisy, back FUCK UP
I came to rip the ROOF off this motherfucker
The more hyperactive they get, the louder I spit (WHOOO!)
And it won't stop until they start a fight on this bitch!
When I play the microphone, I set the bitch on fire
Who says they are more difficult? They are a damn liar!
I play the stage, the crowd goes wild (AHHH!)
The devil raised me, motherfuckers can't fade me
I keep my head in the air because I know I'm the shit!
B-O-U-T about that (about that)
Tear this damn club up, nigga get noisy
Big Snoop D-O-double-G in this sonuvabitch (beitch)
I have to run because I'm coming with that southern shit
Whatchu thought motherfucker? We will continue to be rich
Well the saying goes, we slander hoes
While they're paying hoes, we get up
And we push these pony-ups
And the heat goes where the friend goes
And the friend knows
No Limit and DoggHouse keep it like a crack
Mackin actin, rip-rackin, gun clappin, and chip stackin

Yo Snoop, it's your country uncle Master P man

It's not unlimited Snoop, you've been good to me
Now it's time for me to be good to you
I'm about to give you your own wodie blocks
You do what you want to do
Bring them in, we get the kilos from south to west
We send them, we give them to the world
Tell the damn enemies to shut up!
Because there is still no limit
But they don't realize it's not the last Snoopy deal
It's you and me baby, let's toast to success!
DoggHouse, No Limit, the damn man of the world!
"Last Meal" on that bitch, damn cockroaches!
Yeah give me some gangsta shit
Some of that hood shit
How does that sound?
I've been doing this shit from day one
Yeah nigga, day one, day one, yeah
Let me, let me tell you what you're worth
Wake up in the morning with a purpose
Only you can make me happy, surface
East side long beach baby, the shit on the lawn
The place where lurked
13 on the scene bending
With all a lotta snake venom
Used to steal annihilators from downtown highway
Get up early to start shitting
Flipping back, stumbling, flipping, crippin 'cold-hearted
Long before I reached the tall man
Heat the damn pan
Little boys love Snoop, fuck IronMan
I'm a vet on the set, I'm not lying
Let me show you how to fly I am
Play at school, lie in the pool
And I stay calm
Young I'm not fooling around
Reset, repeat
Unlock and repack
The heat and it gets so fast
Spend your money
It will get in your ass
Now the question is this for now
Are you really in love with that bitch?
Another man's trash is another man's treasure
What is your pleasure
Looking directly at you from a hawk's eye
On my balcony, asking how can I?
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, many G's start to smile
Bad 4 me
Everything you had 4 me, everything was bad 4 me
Curr used to run with strikeout gon 'away
Cold stuff is that he called me on the phone today
He said he was free
Yeah loc shit don't change
Long Beach did not overturn crazy durange
Everyone selling, word of mouth, the OGs say now
To cut a game with my great friend Donald Ray
It's a little hard for me to run away
Get out of my car without a gun today, underlying
I press my luck, if I get stuck, well, that's what happens
How can I love someone else?
Bad 4 me, many G's start to smile
Bad 4 me, fuckin you hoodrat bitches
Everything you had 4 me, everything was bad 4 me
The true definition of that mixtape
When I can't love myself enough to know
Bad 4 me, many G's start to smile
Bad 4 me
Everything you had 4 me, everything was bad 4 me
Someone pass that wacko, grow up

Hehe aw yeah

What do they know about this?
Something from that boogie gangbang
Something from that boogie bang-bang
watch this
One lil, two lil, three lil G's
Across the street, look at the enemies
Nigga got a tec-nine slipped on those trees
Just in case one of the biggest OGs
Take these G's for fleas, nigga freeze
Nigga and my boys are out of the ordinary
Glide on the 7-duece coupe deville
For a real cutting game, while cutting trees
Smokin 'in the [?] Called sunkist
While you smoke in the joint with a fat bitch
The game is having fun and everyone wants to laugh
Everyone wants to be players without training personnel
I'm laughing, doodling the game on paper
As Master P and Tony Draper
Travel, I have hoes, clothes, a Rolls with ...
Rear seat security tied with heat
Rolling down the east side of LBC
On a mission for them wannabes and wanna-G's
Four, five or six lil skeez die for them baby, eat deez
I slipped into the Mickey D's parking lot
I order some fries, a smoothie, with triple cheese
Baby in the cash register, man who couldn't believe
Begging for my autograph, tugging on my sleeves
Screamin '"D-O-double-G's please don't go"
Pulling on my cock and she fell to her knees
I wish I had the time, I'd love to suffocate
But I have a breeze, I'm in the 8 Tray reg-
Light the trees with my dog H-Deez
Finna take the rest, raise the D-P'z
Stay, party at the HGC
He's hosting it, west coast, shit
I have my persimmons and my wallabees
With my golf hat tilted back, too G
East side, LBC, with these shackles on my feet
I have hoes, clothes, a Rolls with B
And this is how we do it at LBC
It's like seven lil, eight lil, nine lil children
And all with tattooed tears
It's like seven lil, eight lil, nine lil children
And all in tattooed tears, nigga
I'm glad I'm a damn lil ass G
Pimp hoes until they're gone and roll dice with teasers
Look it's niggas like that what I need
So when you hear my name in jail you better speak well
Because you never know which of my friends is in the cell
The beach swells, so look how I feel
You have to be off the wall to represent this
Damn it serving a life sentence
Check that they have chips and serve as a cake (who am I?)
Don't kick it with busters unless the food comes out
38 especially for shooting
Only six shots, I have to roll with that
I try to stay in the game, I don't try to give up
Like ten, eleven, twelve lil niggas
All from Long Beach and trying to make figures
It's a gang of riders and we keep some warmth with us
We have hoes, clothes, a Rolls with B
That way, nigga ain't beating me
And uh, I still have love for LBC
It's like a lil, two lil, three LBC
Rollin 'wit' the DPGs
It's like four lil, five lil's LBC
And they roll with the black of the DPG
For life, huhuh yes

East side nigga, red ride
Like a star that falls out of its place
Slipping from the sky
Falling through space
When you touch my hand
I swear I feel like I'm dancing
(Ballin ', Ballin', Ballin ', Ballin')
Like a wheel
Rolling downhill (rolling downhill)
Your kisses make me dizzy yeh
In the head (ooh yeh)
And i'm dancing
Hmm, I love this game because this game loves me back
I'm pushing a lac, smoking bags like a crazy mac
Bringing back, hitting the 8-track track
Drama and battle cat and snoop well
Big stars in big cars we stop at the big clubs and sit at the big bars
Drinking champagne from a cavier bowl
Say it, say it, because everyone denies it
The player plays it, because you can't deny it
As fast as it gets, as fast as I spit, you know it's the shit
It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch
Go back to the old school, the old fools know
This here that we make it so original
It is how we establish
In true love it feels good to have
Like a rose, turning down the street
Looking so sweet (looking so sweet)
Bumpin to the beat (bumpin to the beat)
These streets keep me busy yeh
Make bread
And i'm dancing
(Ballin ', Ballin', Ballin ', Ballin')
(Ballin ', Ballin', Ballin ', Ballin')
Ballin making dough
Because I am so excited
I keep women on my line
That i'm dancing
(Ballin ', Ballin', Ballin ', Ballin')
There I go!
Driving down the road
Ballin 'excites me so much
And I know, I'm dancing
(Ballin ', Ballin', Ballin ', Ballin')
Yeh ballin '
(Ballin ', Ballin', Ballin ', Ballin')
Do that, who, who did they call
Baller, put your ball
Everything is ready now, fall into a new rhythm
There really is nothing to prove
We set the mood
Or shoot some billiards
Or a cool burns
Than? What a fool
Now you can navigate if you want, but I prefer to do the cha-cha
And once my little kitchen? Throw?
Be careful, it is not necessary to take out your Glock
Look at my hair and the girls with me
They got the same
Pimp Pimp Parade, my nigga get your bang
Because my uncles about to sing
And all over the world, my nigga, it's the same song
And when it's time for you to call, fall, without stopping
Keep playing
Stacking dollar bills (stacking dollar bills)
Increasing dog pound (he will increase dog pound)
Loved in every city
Why is playing
(Ballin ', Ballin', Ballin ', Ballin')
Yeh ballin '
There it is because it is there
Now sit back and come play with a player.
They say that time brings change and change brings time
It is so genuine and so divine.
Now tell me baby, what can D-O-DOUBLE-G do for you?
There really isn't much that a player wouldn't do for you
And come find a bar for some of this
And come buy yourself a bar of this ball
Yeah right this is ahh radio station 187.4 DG
Hit him in the ass
With something from The Dramatics
And dog snoop
Let them see it well
It is another one of those world premieres.
Doing it doggy style, in your air hole
For 2000 plus 1, yeh
Soldiers ..
Gangstaz, gangstaz ... What about my nigga?
Yeah i'm about to fall into this party with my little bitch mane
It's in your neighborhood
No, you don't have to roll with me, everything is fine
I trust your dog
Aw nigga shut up nigga I hear you don't stumble
But in the meantime or in the meantime
I slipped my bitch in the back and she messed with all nine
You and me baby come one by one
It's your hood, so I think it's good
But if those niggas start to stumble
I'm not shitting, I'm not Hollywood
We drive ours from the stars to the handlebars
With buckshot coming from friends in cars
Aww yes; How do you want to play this?
No wait, let me see how I should say this
The bitch who was trying to trick me
And take me out of the bitch in the heat
And a party with a gang of brands and a weirdo (where are you from)
I have to dust them off if I rush them
And these niggas don't seem to want to fight (fuck them)
I'm going to crawl to whose walk, all because of my loneliness
Nigga didn't bring damn friend
I'm fucking with this hood rat (shit, shit)
That's wrong with niggas
What more can I say? "Top Billin '"
Crackin bitches in your hood bitch
Could you stop Schemin and look hard?
I have a great big bodyguard
So step forward if you want to hurt yourself
Nigga crazy cause I touched under her bitch skirt
Hoes call me puppy when they feel really hot
This is how it is, ask your children
I stole you while you were in prison
Dogg is relaxing, makin a killin
What more can I say? "Top Billin '"
I lost the Coupe and the keys to the Caddy
So bad that now I'm living with my mom
I lost my balla doe and my balla ho
Man a little ass, black man, I'm falling slow
I can't even call a ho; I feel small
Take it, because once we have it, come kick it
And bring them the same bitches without skan (why?)
I have some friends lying in the kitchen
On a mission to continue dishonoring all fools
Cold doggy dogg shot hoes that broke the rule
They will have, feel the pain, more and more sweet
Even bitches feel the warming motherfucker

Time to get to work on this motherfucker
As we always do this time
{* scratching * "To the Batmobile - come on!"}
"Atomic batteries to power, turbines to accelerate"
"Roger, ready to move in"
No one can save the day like Batman
Robin, it will make you swing like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fighting crime
No one can save the day like Batman
Commissioner X here!
There are problems preparing in Gotham City
Holy mackerel Batman! I think these clowns need to back off
Let's be Gap Band and drop the bomb on them and make them SCAT man
(When it's on, it's cold, so bring the coroner's cap)
We can take it to the Bassment, live with Tigger
Go for The Riddler and watch me play that nigger like a violinist.
On a hot tin roof, I have them watching who?
The one who spits it out like she's drinking rotten beer, ooh
(We marvel at you Comics, you are not a superhero)
Surprise! The dynamic duo
License plate! It means over a million sales (huh)
That's a silly shot to lick, you finish
Also, we have bat bats, so why would I run? (huh)
"Batman! Batman! Batman!"
{* scratched: "And you're about to find out" *}
{* scratched: "And you're about to find out" *}
Yes, when it's beef in Gotham City I, I have to turn and
Hit them with the POW! BAM! CLOUT! Whoa
Robin, I'm more than a partner, I'm more like the more alive
And as a collision, I hope your mothers have made provisions
Look, you ain't got no wins baby, not even a dick
Crazy hostility, now I really feel
Turn on my utility belt, make your facility melt
Get mean in your case like Detective Van Adder
Trust you, Batman and the two Dynamics!
Catnip for Catwoman so I got the feeling
Huh, talk about the taste of a Pringle
A favor for a favor maybe later we can mix
They hit Gotham, I gotta do my thing
Bat Man! The war is on the brink
It looks like the penguin is causing a bad smell
Call Robin fast, you know what to do
Add dye to the water and splash the city with blue
Shit, I'm there in an instant, Batmobile in 3
Trust me friend, I'm hot for Mr. Freeze
And Clayface will catch the clamp
Napalm when I drop my Bat Bomb
.. and don't forget it
Taking out fools and you don't know how I did it
No one can save the day like Batman
Robin, it will make you swing like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fighting crime
Robin, it will make you swing like that and
Beat for beat, rhyme for rhyme
Deep in Gotham, fighting crime
Dirty Dinkins Batman!
Did you see those crisp khaki folds in that miserable and sturdy ...
Aiy-yo-yo-yo returns Robin
Get Alfred and tell him to have grilled buffalo wings
And a pitcher of cold Kool-Aid
It is about to become real on the field.
Leapin Lo-lo's! Over there Batman! That is a no-no!
Yes, yes, compromised systems
Start the Bat Engine, hit the Bat Switches
Are you ready Robin? Let's dive
Let's dive in! I mean, crazy relatives in Kingsville Batman!
We must, WE MUST Batman, listen to me
Holy Leapin Lizards and Gizzards and all that shit that comes with it
And potatoes on top with sauce in the middle
Damn it, Batman! {* echoes *}
This nigga beach town
This nigga beach town
Hey? Than?
This nigga beach town
(You know we had to do a remix)
Hey? Than?
This nigga beach town
Long Beach already joined, now you know you're in trouble
If you got to the beach without a double Snoop D-O
Look, we listen to those who hate to speak, that does not mean that we listen
I'm busy chasing dreams, I see no competition
Daisy Dukes bitch sails through town
And that fat ass makes that bike explode
All my bitches are pretty, tough as a diddy
If you're not on the move, get your butt out of town
Bitch really
Hit my city, my city we hit
All my friends turned their backs on me
Yes, mind over matter is ground over talk
Cover not full, call me Mad Hatter
In my shit, the colonel struggles with the merits
Cut from the cloth of a boss I inherited
Don't sleep, I'm tied to these streets like a marriage
Loyal on my ring finger, love in my midst
Bitch different every day like it's civil
But you would never catch him on a leash in my kenal
Cola doesn't save him Cola doesn't make him cape
Tail feed him croak real bitches relate
Pushes my own line to the west of the state
I picked up the game and put it on my plate
Queen of the west, this is not debate
This nigga beach town
Hey? Than?
This nigga beach town
Hey? Than?
This nigga beach town
Hey? Than?
This nigga beach town
Yeah and you know long beach did
But we are not dropping the black name, this is no assistance
These niggas are in conversations talking about their business
I have no friends, they are acting funny
At first it's great, but if they don't get money
End soon because motherfuckers don't want to see you boom
They don't want to give much credit where they should
They just stalk my instagram and wait for me to get hooked
That will be the day you niggas mean you forget
You used to make investments in the future nigga, beach
This nigga beach town
Hey? Than?
This nigga beach town
Hey? Than?
This nigga beach town
Hey? Than?
This nigga beach town
Hit my city, my city we hit
This is just a long beach thing
All my friends turned their backs on me
Speak that and I will peel you
I'm from the north side of Long Beach
But I don't say names because that's dry snitching
Your vivid mind, blind the vision with my letters
I can't pay attention to the bitches, these niggas stay in their feelings
Because now they see that I am the most real
I'm going to be killing shit, do you feel it?
Long Beach City bitch
N-A for motherfucker E
Screaming checkmate, I'll be the queen of the beach
If the sky is the limit, I guess I look like the clouds
Just smoke if it's loud like bitches run over you
Put my heart in this shit, like it's hitting my beat
I'm in my position as a Joker, I'm not kidding
Smoke that shit that's on your neck like a rope
Niggas, thirsty, leafing through, I'm your little witch, ah
Make that nigga nigga give me bills without talking about rent
Top put it to carve like head on pillow
The dead presidents made me look like a widower
This nigga beach town
Hey? Than?
This nigga beach town
Hey? Than?
This nigga beach town
Hey? Than?
This nigga beach town
All my friends turned their backs on me
Speak that and I will peel you

Football in the hood dog, you dig that

You're a college girl but that doesn't stop you from doing
Come see the Dogg in a bell near you

Beautiful i just want you to know
You are my favorite girl
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
Youse a hood rat
You have no mass
I wonder why I captured his sight, it had to be the ice.
Dark skin, strange eyes like Russell Simmon's wife.
Now I'm thinking of breaking it twice
Brown color, corn bread, best customer in sight, aight
Louis Vutton shoes, handcuffed, [?] A book
Large glass filled with Hennessy
Nah, that bitch is not my girl, only when I'm around she pretends to be
Look, I don't dance much (no)
If you wonder why I'm pulling my pants up
My nymphomaniac lives on the edge and watches the WNBA
She wears braids and headbands, she is cute and her brain is sick
And she doesn't turn around when I look at another girl
Cause she's looking at the same bitch
Beautiful i just want you to know
You are my favorite girl
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
Youse a hood rat
You have no mass
Look, I only want you
Know that you are really special
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Look, I only want you
Know that you are really special
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
Snoop Dogg clothes, that's what I'm prepared for
You have my photos on the wall of your room, and
But girls like that want to listen to Pat Boone
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
You're a college girl, but that doesn't stop you from doing
Come see the Dogg in a hood near you on
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist my fingers and wear dark blue and
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
On the east side, that's the team I choose
Nothing I do is new to you
I hit the world if they are rude to you
Because girl you are so beautiful
Beautiful i just want you to know
(Yes, oh yes, there is something in you)
Youse a hood rat
You have no mass
Is it because I'm black?
Someone tell me, what can I do?
(Because there are not enough bars
I swear I never told anyone
It started in '82 at a 'Hood House' party
Half Ded, Lil 'Loc and my nephew D
I don't know what we do, but this is RTC
Heart lit, putting flags in Tucane Park
I leave the house to go to school, but I come back at dusk.
Do you feel Me?
More Power, More Leadership: Unifying Bloods and Crips
I used to smoke a pack a day, I had to pack a K
Now I have brothers in suits at my college
Pushing peace on the streets: north, west, south and east
Game student, yes, it's time to make a change
So I'm following, no more swine shots
I'm just going to walk the path of a fair man
As-salamu alaykum, lord
Yes, that's the plan ...
Yeah I'm with Obama just to add a little drama
I had a conversation with my mom, I had to let her know who I am
Make a change, and she said "baby, go ahead and do that"
And he said to me, so I'm teaching the brothers how to be peace
What's up We're too strong, and if we all get along
The enemy is always looking for leadership that will rise among black people because it is only through effective organization that you can change the reality in which we live
Yeah this record is for my baby, my baby boo
And you say I will never make records for you, no more
Yes it speaks real
Been around the world
I've been to many places, I've seen unfamiliar faces
But darling, none of them compares to you
I saw it all twice
I've been around the world, I've seen every scene twice
Trampling in Tokyo, diving into the rice
I'm a boss in the wind, I broke all the colored dice
I do it big, fuck the rumors
Gangs don't die, they just move to Miami
I did all that, my (?) Voted for me
I am something like Sammy
Drinking Chardonnay, making bills with my hands free
Father Hood, now the actors can't stand me
Relax my mind and just relax
As soon as I get home, I am looking forward to disconnecting my phone
Yeah but now i'm back to the other side of the water
I'm in sydney with someone's daughter
Blowing sticky down the zippers
And you can tell how my rag hangs, nigga this crip
But I am relaxing; it feels so good to escape
Especially when your name is D-O-double-Gizzee
From coast to coast, man, I've been doing that
What did Cuz just start dancing? I've been out of the trap
Poppin 'P's with the bosses
300 for the yacht, the third deck has an office
Docking in Monaco, going to church with my friends
Bad Lucc killed me when he fell from that boat
But the bad guy doesn't die in the end, so sue me
Then I relax and I relax
Because without you, none of this is real
Baby you know i
I've been to many places, I've seen unfamiliar faces
But darling, none of them compares to you
As soon as I get home, I am looking forward to disconnecting my phone
I've been to many places, I've seen unfamiliar faces
But darling, none of them compares to you
As soon as I get home, I am looking forward to disconnecting my phone
See you baby
Yeah i'm on my way home right now
I'm on my way right now!
I'm leaving the study right now
Yeah as soon as i get home i'm going to disconnect it
In fact, I'm not even going to bring him home
See you in a minute
Smoking a fat sack, right here at the station that plays
My dicks in your ear, caller, you mean what?
Hello? Hello? Caller?
Oh hell with that
This is something new for the underground
At the L.B ... see you when I get back
Dedicated to the East Side, Two One Street
My favorite and your favorite
Check it out right here on the station that only plays platinum hits
187.4 on your FM dial
We'll take call number 21 for those Janet Jackson tickets
That's 310-P.O.U.N.D. female dog
That's da pound
Listen, listen, come one, come all
You are invited, so go ahead and light it up
Because it's the first time in a long time (right)
Remembering about the Fresh Fest in '85
When the dubbing and the San Dieg used to ride
After the lake party at the friend's house
Niggas truer than The Real McCoy
It's the gang of flies, homiez on the switches
Dice on the back if you want to get your riches
Snitches are not allowed in the crowd.
Because this is the G thang, East Side L.B.C. Brang
Finna have fun representing two-one
And I bet no one brings a fucking gun and a ...
Yes, King Park was the place
And to be a G, that was my destiny
And L.B.C. on my friends on the East Side ... (It's like)
No one can see you, but you (yeah, the East Side is perfect)
No one can see you, but you (ha ha, that's worth it)
No one can see you, but you (hell yeah, the East Side is perfect)
If you bring a leash then you have to stumble
We have meat to eat, (crazy to know)
Strolling through the park one day
Inhaling a fat ass J, with my friend named Tray
Deee trying to see if we can put this LBC
Back together like I was supposed to see
And if I have to sit down then I spit on you
See I was regulating, when Cragars was the Daytons
Nigga let me interact with my black croaker bags *
And a gray golf hat tilted back (what's wrong?)
Ditchin 'Sunday school to get a Now and Laters pack
While I'm shooting with the Steelers and killing with the raiders
And when we hit with the saints, we're not kidding
Come from outside the limits and we are going bankrupt
With a small dedication, to the street two to one
Be the next, be NXT
Be mohawks, be beards
Like nobody, like nothing
Whatever, like this
Like Asuka, like Charlotte
Like Becky, like bliss
No leads, no counts
Without 3 accounts, without friends
Not now with, not then
One shot in a million
One against all, one team
A Finn, a balor
A demon, a king
BRAY
Like Jimmy, like Jay
Like even this boy
No divas, no mud fights
No thanks
A Sasha, a boss
One word, banks
To be heard, to be seen
Like Dolph, like Dean
Without guts there is no glory
One shot, one story
Be yourself
Like now
There is no time
A race
Be like nobody
Celebrate, have a drink and put a forceful in the sky
All over the world, nigga it's 1999
Shit out of control, sign of the times
I haven't had so much fun since '79
I was only eight years old then, I hadn't been to the penn '
Just a young black man in front of a swing
Playing soccer at Poly High
Too young to ride, but still the east side
Homicides didn't happen much, blacks didn't rap much
Fuck yeah nigga wanna see the end
Same dogg channel, same dogg time
Only the strong will survive in 99
So much drama and deception, my conclusion is confusing
Dripping on my memories, turning off my music
Trying to get my people to do things, oh yeah, we do it, we do it
But those Westside niggas are the craziest (craziest)
Summer on the routine, baby let me shine, let me shine
Roll with this shit, I'm cold with this shit at my best
Nigga did time and I never dropped a dime
Be smart, a new beginning is all you need
First things first, because you quit smoking marijuana
But somehow
Better days ahead, Freddy is dead
I love confetti, I'm always ready
Keep some assassins by my side and some riders by the telli
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow
Two down, with just a gun
My nigga, and who said that killing wasn't fun
I feel alone in the area with a stone face
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Corleone
Tragically casualties and deaths
And all kinds of funny niggas coming after me
My big daddy once sat me on his lap and said
Sonny, get your money before you're done dead
I never really understood what he said
Until my motherfucker smacked himself on the head
Cold road nigga gotta learn her lesson
Slow down and go down, shit, you know
Be smart, a new beginning is all you need
First things first, because you stop smoking weed
You are what you smoke, my black stop hating
That's why you broke up and that's why we celebrate
But life is so hard on a G, that's what everyone says
But somehow, you have to do a better way
(Somehow somehow)
You have to do a better way
(You have to do a better way)
You have to do a better way
(You have to do a better way)
You have to do a better way
(Yes, better days ahead)
(Better days ahead)
Better days ahead
This is real
I feel your pain nigga
I used to be like you nigga
Before I got off on this rap shit
Shit, nigga did anything to get a dollar
You know, but one thing I never did
I never beg a nigger for anything nor ask a nigga for anything
So from me to you, man to man
Shit, keep the faith and get to work
Because I'm mine regardless
Nigga if I'm rapping or on the streets
I have to have it
For those who don't know what to do
Let it be a blessing every day
Every step of the way
You don't have to be afraid of rejection.
Know that it is only God's direction
It doesn't matter religion or your faith
It is the bible of love
Love Bible, Love Bible
Until the haters get the message
Love Bible, Love Bible, Love Bible
I like big bitches because they are so big
Big bitches always take over
Do you want to grab a skinny nigger like Snoop Dogg?
But a big bitch shit a nigga needs
I always have the drink and something on the grass
And I never have a damn need again
And every nigga I know made fucked a fat hoe, so
There is no reason for the Dogg to lie
I like it when they weigh around two or five
With all this shit going on today
I prefer to have a great bitch because she pays what she weighs
You know there is always a lot of shit about talking black. There's always some big-mouth motherfucker hating. Always a black hating It is always someone who is disgusted with what you do. You can never make motherfuckers happy. There is always someone unsatisfied who feels entitled. There's always some bitch on the bench talking shit with her big mouth There's always something big talking about what you should do with your money and what you could, should, should ... it's just that ... you understand me? Big Mouth with your big ass in your mouth!
Big mouth (you too)
You have a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You have a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
There is a rumor about me and my crew.
About something we did or are supposed to do
You may not have heard it or maybe you have
But when I first heard it, all I did was laugh
You can say what you want, just spell my name correctly
Cause all I'm guilty is rockin 'the house
So if you like to hate, tell all your friends
And if you don't wait until you see me again
This way I can hear it from the horse's mouth
At that very moment, we can straighten it
Because I don't get involved with him he said she said
So take my advice and quit while you're ahead
I stop and put a cap on your ass
Big mouth (you too)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
People used to say you have a big mouth
Because what we do is just between you and me
It's not something you run and tell your crew
But you had to tell Sharon and she said to Carol
Then the story continued like a wheelbarrow
Carol told Bibi and she said to Pam
And Pam heard her man talk
Pam was such a newbie, what she thought she heard
And somehow my nigga Diddy Bop found out
He told someone he knew about Fruit Town
They called me and they took me down
Now the whole damn story has changed
And that's the reason why I'm not fucking with you now
Because you should never have opened your mouth at all
And I would have had no reason to make this call
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You have a big mouth (I can't forget you)
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You have a big mouth (I can't forget you)
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You have a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
Now you're the neighborhood dropper
Just like a snake rolling on the ground
Looking for some new land to spread out
Now you're the neighborhood dropper
And every time I see you it's no use
Just like a snake rolling on the ground
Looking for some new land to spread out
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You have a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth (yeah nigga)
Big mouth (you too)
You have a big mouth (I can't forget you)
A big mouth, a big mouth
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Fuck you after you're done
And I jump on my journey to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick these nuts and suck your cock
Fuck you after you're done
And I jump on my journey to make a quick run
I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll and fuck hoes at night
Tight as a motherfucker with gangsta punches
And we were dancing on the damn streets of Compton
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Song number 1 after song number 1
As long as my damn pockets were fat
I didn't care where the bitch was
But she was hanging on with a white bitch doing the shit she does
Sucking His Cock Just To Get A Buck Or 2
And the few ends he achieved meant nothing
Now she's suing because the shit she's doing isn't shit
Bitch can't hang out on the streets, she found herself low
So now take me to court
It's a real conversation for your butt
So acknowledge and move on to Daz
Damn hoes, the mass of the clock is useless
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you are looking for in a ho that has cash flow
And how my niggas kick the hymn like that, bitch!
Lick these nuts and suck your cock
Fuck you after you're done
And I jump on my journey to make a quick run
To the store, to get me a 4-0
So I'm headed down the street to Long Beach
Just to find me, a monster
To lick me from head to toe
And I'm here, now I'm ready to finish
Nothing but friends around, so I raise my gun
Bitches in my nuts like clothes
Because a hoe is a trick
I don't love them tricks (why?)
Because a trick is a bitch
And my dick is constantly in her mouth
And turning them into tricks, hoes, now
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Pussy was the bomb, I had a nigga in the spring
I was in love like a motherfucker licking pearl tongue
Friends told me that she was not good.
But I'm the crazy man in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood.
I'm back in the damn county jail
Release me on a hot sunny day
Your girl was cheating while you were wrapped up in your county blues
And I already have to do some chin checks
Move the block up as we go
Kick in the do ', I look at the flo'
It's my cousin Daz and he's fucking my hoe, me (bitches ain't shit)
I opened my shit, I'm heartbroken but I'm still crazy
Man, fuck a bitch!
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick these nuts and suck your cock
Fuck you after you're done
And I jump on my journey to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick these nuts and suck your cock
Fuck you after you're done
And I jump on my journey to make a quick run
(Bitches ain't shit) I don't give a shit a bitch
Because I'm doing my thing with the swing
I'm hanging with death row like it's nothing
I say you know you can't deal
Cause I'm a bitch that's real
They need to relax
Because I don't give a shit
And I don't give a shit
And I don't give a shit
And now I have to do something
I have to do something that is clean
But when I'm on a dick, hell yeah, I get so mean
Like a washing machine
I can do the laundry
I'm not trying to say that I suck every ding-a-lang
But only the juicy ones
With the tip of your tongue
And then they emerged
With the nuts hanging
Bitches ain't shit
Yes it's time to get your butt to the table, all of you
It's X to Z, Xzibit, yeah
Double D Snoop, uh, OG
Than
Covering the world, right
Yes, Ja
Listen look
You don't try a hot box with me, I drink hard liquor
Going down in the second round, everyone hails the subway
How does that sound? Xzibit recoils from conflict
Fuck the nonsense! Terrorist, here to bombard shit
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I am the reason there is no time to reach that weapon
And why troubled blacks keep walking
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
Minimum wage from 9 to 5? What kind of life is that?
For me? It's blasphemy, you're fucking
With Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to want to tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap like the opposite sex
Driving drunk, try stacking my loot
While other rappers "treat each other like a prostitute"
So check out the SoundScan
All I want to be is a G, ha!
All my life, black please, ha!
Breaking these damn keys, ha!
Let's get these damn G's, ha!
Nigga, you don't wanna fuck with this
Hmm, oh no, great Snoop Dogg
Back in the heezy, baby
Are you kidding my style? You are very crazy
Dre say, there is no "No Limit" to this
Look here bitch, you're fine and I dig your style
Fuck off with a nigga and do it doggy style
I will be gentle, sentimental
Shit, we fuck in the rent
From coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago
(Yeah nigga you know what's going on man) I've got this pussy everywhere I go
(These bitches know what time it is) Ask the bitches in your neighborhood because they know (Hell yeah)
(Hoes knows a nigga like me, man) I have this pussy wherever I go
Bitch please! get on your knees
For this money, chronic, clothes and grass (Look)
Look, you're fucking with some real O.G, bitch please
Bitch please get on your knees
Yeah you're fucking witty with some real OGs, you tease your dick
Bitch please! Now what you need to do is
Different hits (Huh-uh) for different people
Oh, you like making niggas and getting locs?
A cute bitch with a whole lotta heart
Shit gets thick when the light goes dark
She says she licked me (Well, plug it in)
It is worth about 200 G's and 30 ki's!
Now watch this, Dre: Now if I don't move
But you know me, Dogg, I'm moving!
It's nothing more than groovin '
To seize that opportunity and steal your man and hit the pussy
A victim of circumstance
That's the devil, they always want to dance
Look, we came out with a bang (Bang, bang)
I'm trying to work so cold that
And take all of this
I get the money wherever I go (I go)
Bust a bitch and take her money for 'sho (Fo' sho)
I get the money wherever I go (I go)
Bust a bitch and take her money for 'sho (Fo' sho)
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't want to step on me
Still claiming D.P.G. until the day that D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't want to step on me
Still claiming D.P.G. until the day that D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't want to step on me
Still claiming D.P.G. until the day that D-I-E
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't want to step on me
Still claiming D.P.G. until the day that D-I-E
Blasten
Niggas hanging around with their tanks and their shotguns
The only way I give up if you bitches kill me
Blasten
Niggas hanging around with their tanks and their shotguns
Screaming from the room gives me chills when I blow one up
He left that bloody red boy
"Why did you leave him lying there?"
Because he ran, then he said
Take this bread and make the pasta
Break it and nigga don't be afraid
I was just there prepared
I started to see what I was fucking with the feds
Lotion prowls to enter a royal horseman
40 consolidated to 44
They said I sang like a bird wherever I go
The case is over, more pain but don't pay
And these are the G's that have been fucking the gangbang
We all have one, nigga not one
Nigga pop one, I got a shotgun, nigga drop one
You see me? That is Snoopy Whodini.
Makin 'niggas disappear, then put back on black teens
For me, I'm interested in Satan, but keep it low
Charge it, and we're already enemies
And they already know
Turn the page
Shoot fast
This we assemble
This we wild
Doggy in some other shit
I bet it won't
Pop a nigga
let him know
Don't get caught
Keep it g
Keep that thing by my side
Who do we shoot?
Why do we ride?
Daddy talk?
No one?
You do not know?
He does not know
Best best
Let's say you saw it
They know they know
He said he won't
I can't keep up
Loc 'had a cold snap
Meanwhile me and me
We're just going to let it go
Oh, what are you thinking about?
Everyone in and out of L.A
And rats in the plizzot
And we also have to deal with these crooked cizzops
Aw no, the screams of a mother cry
And flames and flames in the scenes of a homocide
My first gat was a fucking deuce-deuce
In the neighborhood late at night like I had some juice
I practiced my aim in the backyard
Had the flash on the fools that absorbed the heat
How I got my damn name on the street
By now a nigga was straight
380 in a hidden place, run to royalty
Now shooting with the gun was so illegal
But the niggas were dying, so fuck it
They in the league, got one and got their gat
Now they are 9 and AK
And all kinds of shells where a corpse lies
But never take it as a threat
Life is like a baseball game, three strikes you are out, no doubt
Curved balls, knuckles, sliders and heaters
You have to stay alert and keep your eyes on their beaters
They greet us, as if they were with our leaders.
Hmm, the grass is ...
Relax, relax and burn like saks on your back
I mix the gin with the chicken
The penitentiary and the cemetery got my boys, but I refuse to let them return me.
Nigga, that's what's going on
Right hand on my heater, left hand on my balls
I'm screaming "fuck the laws"
Dogg bones and paws
Drink 8-ball cans with muthafuckin 'straw
Inclined, supported
Hoes try to reach a nigger, the security screen
We have dem G's, only C's, no fleas
We are the epitome of rap, D-O-double-G's
Biggest, niggas most real talk about it
I spent about a week on that
Season, marinate, try to squeeze it
Now i got that tight shit
Let me spit it out tonight
Bust a bad bitch in sight
Skeet in your face and then I have to take a flight
At 8:30 in the morning with my nigga Dwight
Who got a show for a nigger?
Who got some drugs for a black man?
Love it or leave it, I'll take it home and beat it
I love it when a cocky bitch act
That's when I say I don't need it.
Look i can pass it
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin 'classic
Bitch, don't you know?
I put the G on the P and put the C on the scrolls
But you know, said nuff
Spend the 40's oh-ee
I take it to my head
Fuck the laws
Dogg bones and paws
Drink 8-ball cans with my muthafuckin 'straws
Biggest, niggas most real talk about it
Do you have a thousand nigga I have a weirdo
Uh, that's how we do this shit for the year 2000
New millennium, keep it gangsta you
A little something for low runners
Gangsters
And the bitches
Uh, fuck the haters
Haha you know
That's right here cat

It's hitting baby
Oh yeah, it's [?]
I love this yeah
Okay okay
D-O-double-G
I have a straw for all of you
Is this how they do it on the west coast?
Oooh, do you smell that?
That's funky ugh
It brought me through hard trials
It brought me tribulations
Never let a day go by and don't realize it
I take care of myself
Never let a day go by and don't realize we are blessed
I only know that we are blessed and highly favored
I only know that we are blessed and highly favored
It brought me through hard trials
It brought me tribulations
It hadn't been for the Lord who was on my side
The back was against the wall.
I take care of myself
He heard my cry and rescued me
Never let a day go by and don't realize we are blessed
Don't assume we're here today
I only know that we are blessed and highly favored
I only know that we are blessed and highly favored
As I look back through the years
It's amazing how it kept me
God changed it
I turned it around just for my sake
I know that I am blessed and highly favored
Let's think about it for a minute
It would have been me if it wasn't for the blood
Grace, mercy
Grace, mercy
I am blessed and highly favored
I am blessed and highly favored
I am blessed and highly favored
I am blessed, blessed and highly favored
I am blessed and highly favored
I am blessed and highly favored
(I-I) I am blessed and highly favored
I'm blessed-blessed
I am blessed and highly favored
Favored-favored

It's a party, Crip, I'm screwed with my engines.
Get dressed, so fresh, a big S on my chest

501 with the advice of Stacy Adams
Image of a room filled with Long Beach 20 Crips
In doing this, who in this? Are you in this? We in this bitch

And he said, "We have to do this for the big 2-O," you know

Cause I'm out making money when I'm rockin 'the mic
Been there with me through the good and the bad
Look, let me remember, and turn a fucking blunt to turn on
They put me, '84 in King Park
Shooting hoops with Charlie Mo and [?]
With the bumble bees, true G's on the east side
Then go to [?] And look for any black ass

Happy as it can be (happy as I can be)
You keep blessing me (blessing me again and)
Just believe (just believe)
Try and see (try and see)
Oh-wee (blessing me)
You are blessing me (again and)
I have a lot of things that I can really thank you for
When I was moving fast, I had to delay my role
Out and in control, next episode (he's blessing me again)
Now look here, ugh
I'm speaking from experience, do you hear this? (he's blessing me again)
Blessing me (blessing me)
Oh (can't you see)
Blessing me (blessing me again and)
I just have to believe (try and see)
Oh when my soul is hungry and he feeds me
When my spirit gets a little low, oh-ooh-oh
It lifts me up, it's blessing me again (it's blessing me again)
I really took the opportunity, to be able to dance in the sky
But how could I see what he is saying?
When I was seven I didn't want to go to hell, so I kept walking
Reppin ', for the lord, no weapon will be formed
Sun, in the rut, take me through the storm
It seems like he's testing me again
But on the other hand, it's like I'm blessing myself again
Oh you better come now
Every time I turn around (he's blessing me again)
Blessing me again oh oh
Every time I turn around (he's blessing me again)
And again
Put your hands together
You better come
You are blessing me again
Get up get out of your chair
We go all the way, down here
Dance around the room
Is blessing me again
Yes the blessing waited for you
Yes, you are blessing me, yes (he is blessing me again)
You're blessed going out
Get up get out of your chair
We go all the way, down here
Feel the beat, the beat (he's blessing me again)
Dance until you get rid of your old blues
You have to dance, dance (he's blessing me again)
You should smoke with me
The chronicle blows
The chronicle blows
The chronicle blows
The chronicle sound (drives me crazy)
I have the pi-doun, so sit back and listen to me
Don't go against me, fool, go with me
Yes, we have something in common.
They could look for a nigga, but they never find my bomb and
I have the stash, period, my cash has
Lots of motherfuckers pulling, police shots
I'm not the black of "The One", could you call me "The Two"
Emancipated, concentrated, debated, rated many times
You surprised how I did it, huh?
You hate it, huh, but you know, I'm not even tripping
I'm dividing Swisha, plotting on the next
I'm living my life and never raising my gun
Popping my drink, and I'm going to smoke so hard
The greener the tree, the better the bud
The strength of the branch will tell you how chronic it was
Everything is for good, the board is wooden
But, face and fakin, and time is waist
She doesn't want to give you a number now she hollin Jason
Now don't be mad, just roll onto the platform
And keep a G on the bitch and roll another dub bag
(My nigga) light up that shit, hit that bitch
Then pass it to your friend like beach, pimp (blaze that bitch)
And when you get dizzy, break the do '
And leave me a little laugh
Puff, puff, come on my nigga, a pizza
Come and keep me company
Baby come and fuck with me
It is diabolical, chronic, mythological.
Psychological, make a model ho, fuck a G
Pre-doctor, slow, slow, done, you can get it
The teacher taught it to those with mental apparatus.
I'm that nigger who brought you all the information
In the Chucks, French braids and endo
Big Snoop Dogg with fog on the window
Spell your name on it, put your face on it
And hang out with the nigga with the spinach gang bang
Drag it, wrap it blunt or zig-zag
It doesn't really matter, even if it's in the package
I'm trying to bounce with all the ounce (smoke me)
Do it now, do it now, do it now, do it now, do it now
Do you think you could fuck with marijuana (Star Trak)
(Yes, Pharrell, this shit here)
And bbc - nigga
Starting our drink
Do you dig what I say?
We will never sing
We will continue to flow
That's real shit, Pharrell you're my loc '
Neptunes, Star Trak
(It surprises me)
Billionaire Boys Club, DPG
Doggy style records, ooh wee
(It surprises me) ..
Look at him, look at him - Kurupt is coming
And there will be no more waiting
Look at him, look at him - Doggystyle is coming
Iffa eedyot ever disrespectful, now ...
Now follow me deep in my mind
Think about how many plots it blooms and how many times
I'm sedatin, my suffocated from the start broke
And the grass smoke from the bombardment that will make a black man drown
To my loc I walk down into the deep valley
To my friends at the L.A. Libra and the beach
With these silly bitches looking for niggas riches
A big shout out to my niggas on Darby Twp
Homies catch robbery and assault cases
It's not my fault that my shit can hit like that
Now when a black man has to puree for him, he can't stop
I have to get somewhere
My state of mind these days makes the average black scared
Hurt them the worst way, leave it to me
Put them to rest, he confesses, though
Snatch them a cap and destroy them at my best
By the simple fact of contact, we block the environment
We drop bombs and we know we calm the wild beast
And the rest of the jungle I'll mistreat
Any MC trying to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
I have the flavor, and I am important
Busta-ass niggas can't stop us, and they can't fade us
Shadowy niggas can't stand next to you
Quick as a cheetah when I'm catching you
I bet I won't let you escape, face the real point
I burn the zag or the bone
Once again, another area left
MCs try to take a step, light up and fly away
In the end the lights go out, so before they do
I'm an L-B-C onwards, I stay faithful
Demanding my respect, respect is what I have given
To the point of no return, so the streets I roam
Don't catch the chrome on the dome of this black flack
Whistle and watch all my boys come
Run or listen to the click, damn that shit they beat you with
This is a premeditated cock
To all hunters who are jealous and hate it but can't fade away
With every attempt they fail, oh well
The consequences are suffered
I put pressure on the silly motherfuckers
The bill is sharp (the deal is) the deal is this
I have to plan them in a puree for my chips
Get in my way and be stepped on
With subjects all subject to damage, when swarming
Who knew about the real deal I hide?
And still, can you feel that the whole issue is about trust?
No, ho is a must
If I burst my brain builds to form the knowledge to the maximum
Lifting setbacks of defeat and defeat
We wax tracks and hit the MCs that make up the violence
Bring drama without parental guidance
The eyes were fooled, something under my sleeve to intrigue
Also D-P-G and L-B-C when
We do the work for you, so call your team
The conflict will be verbal, so watch how you speak
Insomnia acts that are a bomb for you, suffer from insomnia
And i will come for you
So keep an eye out for the Doggystyle crew
It is a MC barbecue barbecue.
Watch out! Watch out now!
Ha ha, yes, you're a bad me, watch out!
Man, this great man, shit, nigga
All that little boy shit, sit down

Cute little mom, but they stack with their backs

You in the doggy world, come join my circle
I break down herbal until I move like a turtle
My money is green and my Porsche is turbo
I'm in the game for real, it's worth relaxing
I go into the club and they pay the bill
She will be on my team, in my car
On the way to the place, yeah, you're

Relaxing with the stars, where the bottles never stop

With a cup of Landy, Tiffany and Sandy.
Girls who like girls, I want to do it with dad
One more drink will take you to sex

La, la la la
La, la la la
A batter retired, Shawty knows the damn thing
Boom shakalaka, here comes the boss rocka
Smoke well with T-Pain and Snoop, the herb doctor
Big 808, now feel the base in your chakra
And watch me smoke like a shotta '
Coca cola bottle shape, light green eyes
Drunk with love like a Colt 45
I keep kush in my lungs, I'm going to smoke to death
I'm just looking for a bad one, for my friend D. Dimes
They do it by fortune, some by fame
Turn up the volume, adjust the play.
It's not a damn change, it's still a G-thang
Lil 'mom whip your hair, exhale the chronic
As the smoke disappears I'm ready to dance
Your girl on my team, and she's ready to fall
And if you didn't know, I'm the great Snoop Dogg
What what? What what?
Boom!
I don't think they heard you
Boom
Talk to them T-Pain
I'll do whatever it takes, however I want! (I want!)
This one for all of you! (This one for all of you!) Oh yes! (Oh yeah!)
Now put your hands in the air (now), whip your hair and go
La, la la la
A batter retired, Shawty knows the damn thing
Boom!
Big Snoop Dogg is a Boss Beach
This is Archbishop Don Magic Juan
Many people don't know about this pimp game (pimp game)
To give it to you plain and simple because you know it's playing
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" as my nigga Pootie Tang
I got that bounce, to make your loot swing
That little girl who says, 'Fred, she's a beauty, Mayne' (Ooh wee)
Rolling with a player because that's what it was
On their bitches hard like Feezuck
Got the heata-fa-heata and the keys
With a pocket full of large face visas
They say it's cheaper to keep her, now baby relax
Relax and burn some of these trees
Now sit on the tree
And do me a favor and turn up the music
Should I slap her or scare her?
Speak when they talk to you, yeah I broke some
I had a monster for me and a monster for you
I make them do it for us
That's what you've been waiting for me to do for months
Many people don't know about this pimp game (pimp game)
But I'm sure you want to know about this pimp game (pimp game)
And to me you know it's not a fucking shit
Hello to them, Doggy Dogg, go and do that
I got that bounce, to make your loot swing
That little girl who says, 'Fred, she's a beauty, Mayne' (Ooh wee)
This is the chairman of the board
The Archbishop Don Magic Juan
Big Snoop Dogg is a beach boss
In fact
I was there when he was crowned 'Boss Playa', church
I had three on my right arm and four on my left
Lime green and gold, we were sharpened to death (Ooh wee)
Playing this game, you can holla on the referee
And ask for a wait time before spending your money
Stop, pause, back off before pulling out your rhyme
And go to the "Wizard of Oz"
And tell them you're trying to get a new heart
A new beginning
Because you realized that you had not played your part
And that was smart
And break these bitches from state to state
See, I've been the most flying since I walked out the door
I don't ask, friend, I just tremble and bake
I'm not going to pretend to make you buy my tape
I pray a prayer to the Lord just to keep my faith steady
Many people don't know about this pimp game (pimp game)
And to me you know it's not a fucking shit
To give it to you plain and simple because you know it's playing
Hello to them, Doggy Dogg, go and do that
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" as my nigga Pootie Tang
I got that bounce, to make your loot swing
That little girl who says, 'Fred, she's a beauty, Mayne' (Ooh wee)
Will you steal from me? (Yes, I will do it)
Will you kill for me? (Yes, I will do it)
Will you steal from me? (Yes, I will do it)
Would you lie to me (Never)
Would you die for me? (Whenever whenever)
Big Snoop Dogg, let you know
That this game is not lame at all
If you have heart you can play this game
But if your heart is not right
We also have a remedy for that.
And Archbishop Don Magic Juan is the magician
Boss Playa ... Boss Playa ... that's what this game is about
Boss Beach
But I'm sure you want to know about this pimp game (pimp game)
And to me you know it's not a fucking shit
To give it to you plain and simple because you know it's playing
Okay, "Sa Da Tay" as my nigga Pootie Tang
That little girl who says, 'Fred, she's a beauty, Mayne' (Ooh wee)
Gangsta, Gangsta, where have you been?
Around the corner playing with brotha'n'em
Youngsta, Youngsta, are you on that again?
Popping 'gats for the pleasure of doing it, when you know you have extremes
I don't think you should be on the streets like that
You know you're the trendy cat type
Doing things, bling bling
West Coast runnin ', lovin', hustlin 'smokin', always chokin 'indo green
With the sticky in your hand, for you
They all surround you because they know you have mo
You like to dive into your 6 'n shit
Rolling down those streets, exploiting CPT
LBC rolling with me, ohh
Some of them lie about the shit they have and what they do on the block
Some of them lie about the weapons they burst
But no, no, no, no
This is how it is for me because I live the life of a boss
Many niggas want to play but still have to pay fees
Some of them have to beg a bitch to stay
But no, no, no, no
This is how it is for me because I live the life of a boss
And the G's put work abroad
At ease with the puppy and smoke some grass
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxifies, it's more for me
Baby this is really presidential, a pocket full of women
It's the beginning with the pearls they give you
The world soft as flax and sweet as cinnamon
But every day as 50 say, there are many men
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'm going to have to let them go
You know how the Dogg rolls, don't twist it
Because he hits the East just in case you want to visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with something pimpish
And it comes from the beach where niggas are a beast
I'm hooked up to the first black bag, the last butt
I want green like spinach and I'm strong to the end
I have a little arrogance that you're not used to
I, I'm going for you in the corner, blocking slander
I'm living that boss's life
Hoes come running when they see me coming
I'm living that boss's life
You can have anything, don't fuck with my money
This is for the dirty west and east and south
When you are in Magic City you carry a lot of influence
But cheating is not the route, even if you have it
There is a method to maintain it when they cannot do without it
If she is a dancer, she will go with a caller
Roll with the Boss Dogg on the back of a blue Impala
And if she follows him then she will swallow it
All the game you gotta give her, be a different bitch tomorrow
'least he knew she was with him, with diamonds on his neck
I'm just an author, spreading the game to my partners
Look at me man, I'm nothing like you
I'm leaning on my journey, for the fifth, hitting my dick
I, I'm going for you in the corner, blocking slander
I'm living that boss's life
Hoes come running when they see me coming
Snoop: Ya playa
Snoop: That's a real pimp shit here
Snoop: These bitches are offline, man
Man: What's wrong, dog, can't you control your bitches?
Snoop: Look at this, man
(chorus: kokane)
I got bitches in my game that don't even know my name
Biotch!
Then squeeze the brakes, hoes
Biotch!
You are the only one, you are the only one
You are the only one, you are the only one, you are the only one, whooo
You're sexy, sexy, sexy, you're so sexy
You are the only one, you are the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one, you're the only one, whoo-oo
You are sexy, sexy, sexy, hmmm
Tereka and Erika love to care for a
Real DPG motherfucker
Keesha, Resha, Tammy and Renesha
I appreciate the way they skate
When the clock struck eight
Now April and Kate
They will be doing too much
Running mouth
Shit, you have to get up
Because I already had enough
Getting sick and tired of the same things
You told Kamil and she said to Karla
And she said to April and now everyone knows it
So all of that confronting the real nigga on the site
Today is today, last night was last night
While leaning my hand on my balls
I really had to check out these bitches and tell them how this dog
(chorus)
Nina does this and Tina does that
Sabrina, Sakina, nigga all my hooded rats
At a young age man, he was on the dick
Non-stop, I hit him and told that bitch to go ghost
(They'll be like hot butter on breakfast toast)
Screaming, pulling out a necklace
And talking shit on the phone with me at my baby-mom's house
(Who is she?) Look, bitch, do you know who the fuck I am?
You better read your damn press telegram
I had to cut the bitch down because she tried to get too close to me
Fucking her friend, a fake bitch (is that true?)
But you know I had to stop and I stopped
And I put my hand on my balls and I said look at this, dog
(chorus)
I have my own place and I have my own keys
So no bitch can talk shit to me
I learned a lesson, I wasn't guessing or stressing
I have another bitch and she was in the nursing home
Shit, I needed a chaperone plus a new home
Snap, crack, it's on
But before long it seems that he fell in love
But I wasn't ready for that
Topcat had to skimp
I hit her friend in the back
I was shaking that skirt
And when he found out, he said that shit hurt (boo-hoo)
A week later my friend Kurt was fucked.
(chorus x2)
(shoop)
{* The music fades *}
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe out
We smoke well, you smoke sour
You have lights out, well we have power
Ask your girlfriend she knows how
Puffed over a zipper on my Eddie Bauer
I like fist fights, you need two Glocks
You're shit, while we play 2Pac
This one that hits all five, yes, that fire
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah, and I'm going to die high
We have Obama and we exploit
We make bubble kush, while you smoke shit
Ask my nephews, up in the yay yay
This is your highlight, so do your shit right
And this is a real talk, so get it right
Your children and your mother say they love me
Because I'm the big dog, and you're just a puppy
I have a great game, you have nothing
You like white girls, so you smell dust
Weigh the bag light and play that flash light
This is your last night, now take out my cash
I'm King Kong, you're just a baby cub
I have a lot of dong, and you have nuts
Smoke with Snoop Dogg, I don't think so
You came outdoors, I like Indo
I'm legendary, you're temporary
You smoke stress for less, we smoke blueberries
Why are you busting that, young black man? You don't have that
If you need to, turn on the headlights.
Because I have that shit to understand well
Now, the smiso smells, I have diesel
Spread the grass smur ', I'm high as a beezurd'
She likes Lebron, he likes Kobe
Well i like baron davis because that's my friend
It's not what you smoke, because you smoke litter
How many T signs should I match?
If you don't have kush, then don't say that
We got here, your grass has brown hair
And that's the kind of weed we don't smoke around here
Look, you smoke red hair, we smoke that there
You got shit, and we got cat urine
We like swisher sweets, you like forests
Your herb has seeds, and do you think that's good?
Boy you're so lost I'm so boss
I have Q.P., for me that has no cost
DO. Double G, L.B. Cizzne '
I suppose it will be my death.
And if it does, then let my lungs rest
Cause I'm in heaven blowing seven of O.G
You can not see? I'm straight OG (OG)
oh come on
Shit, I'm qualified to hit a hoe no matter where I go
Excuse me mate, this pimpin 'let a pimpin pimpin' let you go
Break the bitch you say "I will"
So nigga, shit; since you put it like that
I'm about to fit them in now black
And take them straight to the track (track)
I've never let a bitch suck me
Trying to tell me what to do but I'm going to stay O.G
Just out of the pen only 32 days (32 days)
And I added and subtracted multiplied
Now change worlds
Why was the girl walking with a gold fish in her pocket?
And look at the one with the quick mouth
Only get your money if you have to hit his motherfucker
I don't care what you do
As long as you don't fuck with mine (Come on, sing it, now)
You think you can't be touched
Niggas go away all the time
Old "blue eyes", Dogg Sinatra
Cocker glock, hoe hopper, show stopper
I'll put you on a brick in a building
And separate from your children (daddy)
I stay awake
All the G's in my set are never PC'dup (hahaha)
If you hit the main line
You are going to be trampled
Pay the motherfuckers use a duck sucka
Me and my niggas go hard in the paint
Putting paint where it's not, makin 'bitch niggas weak
Launch your settings and move it from the (Rolling) side to the c side
Hitting you cousin, nigga this cripple
I have so many tricks up my sleeve (Oh you don't know)
You wanna hit let's take it (oh oh)
We're a thousand strong niggas
I don't care what you do (I don't care what the fuck you do)
As long as you don't screw with mine (As long as you don't screw with mine)
You think you can't be touched (Uhhhhh)
No, I don't love you bitch, you're a hoe, I never will (I never will)
I can't tell you my feelings because the pimp doesn't feel
Bitch the fact is gone
Fuck you and make your mom say "Baby, she was wrong!"
Speaking of him, a real pimp
Bitch, you're gumbo with the right harvest of jumbo shrimp
I took out the pen with my hoe, I broke it with my hoe
Mackin steady with my hoe, now I'm stacking with my hoe
I appear a bottle of Mo
About to model a hoe
I'm working them, serving them and breaking them (you know)
The grass, man, got here?
Taking too long
But when I get here dogg
I'm taking a zone (Give up nigga)
Niggas know how D-O-double G "doo's it"
Known for making that crip hop music, don't abuse it
Just ride to the rhythm of a pimp, high class, cold motherfucker
(Humming) Long time you don't fuck with mine
You think you can't be touched
Niggas go away all the time (buzz)
Ayo Tim Spielberg
I've been doing this shit for 25 or 26 years
And one thing about the game
The game does not change
Only the beaches
So what do I want to do now?
I want to shoot a scream
To all the famous beaches, worldwide.
If you use a famous beach, this is for you
220, do you dig?
A lil 'something to ride
My nigga Tim Spielberg on the track
This is an EP
From the rapper of your favorite rapper
Bigg Snoop Dogg
And I know you're going to dig this
Ha, ha, yes
Oh yes i can't forget the ladies
All the women who have been with the Dogg for so long
I love you too honey
Oh mom, do you love me too?
Wassup mom?
Mmm-mmm, I see where you got it from
So what are we going to do here?
Let's slow it down just a little bit
And let this EP begin
Bigg Snoop Dogg 220
Understand me?
It is understood
(Buck 'em)
Alright yeah that's it nigga
Snoop Dogg takes the chrome and enters your system
Fucking your click with this hit
Snoop Dogg, please, won't you break that bitch?
I'm back in the game stuffing my dough
And fuck any motherfucker who says it's not like that
Do it to them, D.O
I'm shaking them, breaking them
Shot him in the face and now they take him away
Here's a thank you for those with a plot
Fool, we should have gone out, now you're going out
And burn the joint now the fifth passes
For a real nigga, did you hear me? You heard
Now is not that a trip (what what)
You need to get up from that shit
(Buck 'em, Buck' em)
Young beast at Fort Greene
(Buck 'em, Buck' em)
(Buck 'em, Buck' em)
Shit wasted
I'd rather see death and then lock myself in metal bracelets
(Buck 'em, Buck' em)
Don't make a difference
Niggas in the hood is still broken and can't fix it
(Buck em), the scene is set (set)
And it's a million bitch niggas about to get wet
I walk them all down the street (fuck it)
(Fuck it), no regrets, nigga cut them off
I love the way we turn them off, shit, it's not funny now
I used to be my friend, friend, wet and bloody nigga now
(Fuck it), it's time to get shit now
(Fuck it) boy, we're on a rampage
Climbing this damn stage, yeah it's still a G thang
Slam doors, slap hoes
Because shitty videos, I got a hundred for shows
If you don't have the papers
I don't have time to sit down and talk about the damn fumes
Biatch, don't even stumble
Come on
(Buck 'em, Buck' em)
Young beast at Fort Greene
Dirty or clean, black, money is all green
(Buck 'em, Buck' em)
Give it back, you know me
(Buck 'em, Buck' em)
Shit wasted
I'd rather see death and then lock myself in metal bracelets
(Buck 'em, Buck' em)
Don't make a difference
(Buck 'em)
Some shit burns for me Q
Yes, Wussup Dogg, this is what I'm talking about
Shut these niggas (shut up, shut up, dogg)
Westcoast nigga, Quik, and Snoop Dogg (forever)
9-9 nigga
When I get up in the morning and get out of bed
I feel good, or if I do
Because I can still leave it for you
Chorus:
Because we are all a little strong
On the beach, where the paper is long
Dog pound
(repeat)
Verse one
Nigga, you know you must have a heart
I told you niggas from the start
If I'm still in it, I'm in it for life
Always stay down and keep my fucking game tight
Because since elementary school, or was it Quik preschool?
I had to have papers, it was routine
A young black man on a mission for them kale
Break niggas
Do niggas, lean on
For fucking with my wealth (black)
And you will notice
And, cuzz, I don't even slip when I'm alone
Sitting on his back resting in the Chronic Zone
Clown you're gone
Surround me, it's on
Get the money you're gone
The role of my niggas so long
So if you want me take me you got me
I should have shot him
But now they call me Snoop Gotti
And that's all LBC
Betta still, that's all DPGC
Chorus (2x)
Verse two:
I'm hitting bones
In front of my house
Choppin 'game on the phone
Big 6, big 5-3 with bitches
My girls in the kitchen, cooking fish and
I'm exploding in this nigga I was stumbling
Oh nigga knuckle head, I thought I was slipping
I blow his ass, pecking peck now his shirt is wet
Dead, gone, the light is off
No regret, I had to get it out
Fucking the dog, I take your life and your money
And then I dive into my place (dip dip)
And set up a store with me rocks (motha fucka)
Because still, all the doggs go to heaven
Chorus (2x)
Verse 3
I'm freestylin '
C-stylin '
Snoop and Quik come for us to take you to the island
Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts
People love me because I drop cuts
That makes sense, it makes a lot of money
Watching Snoop is that nigga who doesn't have to play fun
But I love you, under my wing
Because she likes the song that the wow sings
I'll put it on hold
I will not buy you a ring
And even if she never saw me before
There's just no way she can tell me no
And it's strong enough for your grandma to pay me
Chorus (2x)
West coast, gangsta shit
My nigga DJ Q
Yes
Like i told everyone
DPG for 9-9
DPG, yeah Top Dogg, fo sho '
All of you smoke

Banging, hanging out on our street
Game rules, if you choose to hit
Cadillacs, croker bags
I will see, friends are deep
Banging, hanging out on our street
Game rules, if you choose to hit
You can't be a snitch, don't be a bitch, nigga, make your name
I remember when I was young I had a lot of fun
My mom bought me everything, even a toy gun.
Coming when it's dezark, I'm with the pizark
And with the little breasts, yes, I'm breaking the hezeart
You know, time won't tell
So I will stick to the script as OG go-carts
Bitches hit, they stole from me, you have no heart
Banging, hanging out on our street
Game rules, if you choose to hit
You can't be a snitch, don't be a bitch, nigga, make your name
Cadillacs, croker bags
I will see, friends are deep
Banging, hanging out on our street
Game rules, if you choose to hit
You can't be a snitch, don't be a bitch, nigga, make your name
Authentic, business, I represent you
Bow Wow yippie, long stockings like Pippy
Rare rare, different cut
Cadillacs, croker bags
501's, golf hats and policies
I will see, friends are deep
Banging, hanging out on our street
Game rules, if you choose to hit
Cadillacs, croker bags
501's, golf hats and policies
I will see, friends are deep
Banging, hanging out on our street
Game rules, if you choose to hit
You can't be a snitch, don't be a bitch, nigga, make your name
The grass next to the surf and you can surf with me
We got just what you want, oh batabing
So if you're here my way
In sunny Cali-Forn-I-A
Oh yes this is DPG

Everywhere in the routine
All the time popping up like Cali in the summer
Oh baby
Like a summer in California
Oh baby
Something about your love drives me crazy
Like a summer in California
Get a medical card, yes (in Los Angeles)
They finger like red fox (in Los Angeles)
You can do it in a light blue box, yeah (in Los Angeles)
Because this is how California rolls
You can roll, you say brother, don't you know I'm from around here?
Well girl i like the way you roll
Although you're from the ghetto, you belong to a house in the mountains
I'm not talking about sight
I'm talking about you and me
So if you want to go to Melrose
And then we will go to Venice
You roll so well you could let me hit it
For about 15 minutes
Girl you'll never forget it
And if you want to go around the city
I could show you where the real thing hit him
I'm not talking about those fools
Baby, you could be a movie star, hey (in Los Angeles)
Because this is how California rolls
They finger like red fox (in Los Angeles)
Because this is how California rolls
And when I give you that grass and ask you if you can roll
You say no let me show you around here
Cowgirl wants to roll with a winner
I have nothing to lose
And girl I have a home in that valley
Just tell them what my name is
You heard from me, you heard everything about me
It means you heard all the hittas I'm gangbanged with '
You know i'm talking about you
And if you want to go downtown
You could also roll with real black
I'm not talking about them, people
I'm talking about you and me
Get a medical card, yes (in Los Angeles)
Because this is how California rolls
They finger like red fox (in Los Angeles)
You can do it in a light blue box, yeah (in Los Angeles)
Because this is how California rolls

Wait a minute yes
I thought i knew what i was doing
I have my friends and family stressed
I don't know how to keep this train moving
And I don't know anyone I can run to
And I know that he will take me
Woah yeah now I'm on my knees
That I'm calling you now
Jesus Jesus
So I have to call you with the songs of my life
Somebody call him
Someone sing it
Call it what you need it
Call it like you know it
Someone sing it
Call him when my times get tough, call him when my days get tough
Looking for my blessing, put it in my heart
Giving me a new start, every time I call him
I really don't know about you, but I know what I've been through
Every time I call him there is no saying what God can do
He did it for me, he will do it for you.
He will listen to you when you pray
And he will brighten your day
Because I love, love, love to call him
I love to call it
How sweet the name, how sweet the name
I call him when I need him, call him because I love him
I love the name jesus
I challenge someone to call him
Sing it Jesus
Okay call it out and call it
Someone call it, just the way you need it, just the way you want it
Someone sing it
Jesus when I'm depressed
Jesus change my life
Jesus make me scream and scream
Jesus put my feet on solid ground
Jesus I know you care about me
Jesus, you are always there for me.
Jesus gave me victory
Jesus yes he will set you free
Jesus, Lord, I testify
Jesus, you have been good to me
Jesus, yes, I know you care about me.
Jesus I was lost but now I am
Jesus why did you change my life
Jesus, and I love you more today than yesterday
Call him when my times are hard
I'm looking through my shine, I'm looking through my shine
When the stars are too tight
To watch over your family, to bless your children
Someone says Jesus, someone says Jesus
Say Jesus, say Jesus
Sing it, hit them with it
Call him when my times get bad
When I feel sad and sad
He will come and lift me up
He will come and fill my cup
The name below is above, each name
I said he will answer
Anyone know what I'm talking about
Just put your hands together once
Jesus, someone call him
Someone sing it

Narcotic Vision of the Death Trader, Shipping and Handling of Yola I Supply
Time to get up and wipe the wet eyes out of my eye (out of my eye!)
What are you trying to buy, pimp? you know it's a little dry here
Yes, I only have a couple of cakes left that will last me all year

Devours the cowards, sour slippery on the lip
Beast, suck up to none, don't be silly
Be a block monster, be a reputable motherfucker

Don't put yourself in your place
Give me 40 feet and an ounce of space

I reap while staying attracted to Richard as Pryor
I need to put the gun away because I have a record
It's hard to keep rolling when the world is full of riders
Motivated to win, like I haven't won yet
Do you think shit? Heck I'm not done yet
Tonight will fall like a free fall
Chevy jumping up and down like a damn seesaw
Doing that shit to degrade Dogg
But when I bring it to you, you say "What do you mean Dogg?"
Then we come and go, like it's ping pong
Knowing that I should call you, ding dong!
But that's one thing about this shit buddy
Every move is so seen by these rich boxers
So why should I lose all my wealthy backers?
Pop a beam like an M&M
So fuck him and him
I was gangbanged before a nigga came in
No façade, I left the courtyard
No Suge, No Dre, I did it independently
And that's what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucker, this Crip still hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin 40 is still a big problem
Ponytail still hanging, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I won't fade away
Flip back to the plate shit
Blue red white to black shit but for green
I send a whole damn team to applaud
React to mack shit, problem, terrorist
Shots
Suspect
Request EMT immediately
Yes, new Snoop Dogg [echo]
One for the problem, two for the bass.
Doggy Dogg, you are the best
Rock this beat 'cause you're so cool [2X]
Well if you insist on it I guess I'll twist it
But give me a minute while I drive your sister crazy
Pushes the track against her
No offense, but this pimp is wrong
Tilt your fist up or keep the christ
Turn that bitch on and your sister explodes
This sucks for your jive to speak
East Side RTC walking
People, people listen carefully
I say because especially when they approach me
Stay discreet and keep it OG and don't try to burn me
I love your movies, you are incredible Snoop
(Can I get a flicc withchu?)
I buy your records, everything you do
(Can I get a fchuc withchu?) {Really?}
My daughter loves you she is only two
(Can we get a fchuc withchu?)
You are a handsome boy, you are a little cute
(I really want to get conchu)
Doggy Dogg you are the best
Rock this beat 'cause you're so cool
Doggy Dogg you are the best
Take this shit back home to the west
Melissa Brista in San Francisca
The cute little sister with the feet for blister
Hey, they say I'm like Mr. Bigsta
All these shit moves to miss us
But I'm going to finish it on the floor until it's done
Silly knives and sticks - hoes and fake thugs
Pimps, players and all of the above
(Oooooh Weeee)
Yeah that's bangin 'crazy (for shizzle)
Coming through the scriptures; directly your ditchas
And they want French kisses
Pack the tracks, spin, don't twist us
Roll with me on this dog adventure
But you can't enter without your credentials
And if you go in, you could take a photo (come on)
So feel your shit, go on and get off
It's a hug, baby, it's coming to your city
You don't want to miss this, it's like Christmas
Become VIP with big D-O-G and see what gangstas do
Once we arrive with elchu, we can take photos.
We came to funk withchu
Oh really me in the dilli-do
Who are you calling? (Who are you calling?)
Oh really me in the dilli-do
Oh follow the bouncing ball baby (Who are you calling?)
Yes (who are you calling?)
Burn me, keeping your hot spot hot
Go up, shake what you have - you have a lot
Burn me, keeping your hot spot hot
Go up, shake what you have - you have a lot
Combating these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be on shine and get Grammy's
But these streets will not say goodbye.
I can't say goodbye (to the blocks)
Goodbye (to the hood)
Goodbye (to the streets)
Goodbye (to the blocks)
Goodbye (to the streets)
I can't say goodbye (to the blocks)
Goodbye (to the streets)
Goodbye (to the hood)
I can't say goodbye (to the hood)
Goodbye (to friends)
I guess it's true, you can't take off the boy's hood
Also, my hood just lost another boy
Another closed, and we don't know
If he comes home boy
Industry tells me, just leave it alone boy
Let them do it, take care of your own boy
But I feel, I think, before I was a child
So I dreamed of being a deer boy
Yeah I was running from the po-po, hitting the grass
Late night hunting, laying on the job
Hood next day, airbrushed shirt
Payday on the spot, I cut my hair first
It made mom sick when she didn't go to church
Look, I live in the 'burbs but I think 21
To the blocks that raised me
The enemies and friends that made me
Strong enough to hang around corners that would mold me
Critics wonder if I'm trying to be the old me
So they don't really know me
And we will know that we do not change, we only become O.G
You are always addicted to life, you just don't.
But shit, I owe it to the streets before they owe me
He took me when my mom didn't want me
Too wild to be his son, and he doesn't show up
Now all I have now are friends
To teach me how to be a man and what not
How to divide ounces into grams and what not
The reason why I am so kind with my hands and what not
Shit, do you think I forgot? Not
Thank God every day the boy could spit
And all over the world they enjoy my shit
I know I have many more prizes to get
That made me who I am, the music and the man
He said he could before the world gave a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas saying stick to the plan
It's probably a gun instead of a pen in my hand
I'm probably doing a pen dub with my man
All I had was the lock when I had no fans
I hit the corners when I couldn't turn
All he had were friends when he had no children
If it all fell apart, my career would end
I'm sure my name would live on these streets
I am a man, I have to take care of my family
Combating these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be focused on shining and getting grammies
But these streets will not say goodbye.
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the bell
Goodbye
To the streets (to my problems)
To the bell
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
To the blocks
Goodbye
To the streets
To the bell
I can't say goodbye
To the bell
Goodbye
To the blocks
Goodbye
To friends
VERSE (SNOOP DOGG):
I guess it's true, you can't take off a boy's hood
Also, my hood just lost another boy
Another one has life, and we don't know if he will come home boy
They on the street tell me "leave it alone boy
Let them take care of your own boy. "
But I said to stop a jump, before I was a child
You had dreams of being a fool boy
Yeah i was running from the po po
Putting me at work, good morning, airbrush, shirt
Payday, I got the spot, I cut my hair first
It made mom sick when she didn't go to church
Yes, I live in the suburbs, but I think 21
I know that since I left it has gotten worse
But it would still be there, if I couldn't write a verse
CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
I am a man, I have to take care of my family
I know my mind should be focused on shining and getting grammies
But these streets will not say goodbye.
VERSE (SNOOP DOGG):
To the blocks that raise me, the enemies and the friends they made
Me, strong enough to hang around corners that would mold me
Critics wonder if I'm trying to be the old me
And I don't know, we don't change, we just become OG, you're always addicted
To life, I just don't OD you, shit, I owe it to the streets before they owe me
He caught me when my mom didn't love me, too wild to be a kid, and he shows up
Not now, all I have now are friends, to teach me how to be a man.
In what not, how to stop ounces in grams in what not
The reason I'm so nice to my hands in what ain't shit, you think I forgot, man no
I am a man, I have to take care of my family
I know my mind should be focused on shining and getting grammies
But these streets will not say goodbye.
VERSE (SNOOP DOGG):
Thank God every day the boy could spit
And all over the world they enjoy my shit
I know I have a lot more wars to get
I have a beautiful wife and beautiful children
But it wouldn't be right if I ignore the shit
He said he could for the world, I didn't give a damn
If it wasn't for my niggas saying stick to the plan
It's probably a gun instead of a pen in my hand
I'm probably doing a dub and pen with my man
All I had was the block, when I had no fans
I hit the corners when I couldn't turn
All he had were friends when he had no children
If it all comes down and my career was going to end, I'm sure my name
I would live .. on these streets
CHORUS (CHARLIE WILSON):
I am a man, I have to take care of my family
Combating these pressures in my life
I know my mind should be focused on shining and getting grammies
But these streets will not say goodbye.
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Goodbye

You can get the man off the streets
But you can't take the streets of man
Niggas, get yourself a genuine Miller draft, because it's Miller time
We're about to go hard on these hoes with this one here
Can you control me ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yourself
She is stubborn and just won't obey
Can you control me ho?
You have to know what to do and what to say
Listens
You gotta put that bitch in her place
Even if it's slapping her in the face
You have to control your ho ..
Can you control me ho?
I went to your house
Your girl came in and started cursing you
You should slap her in the face
I wanted to tell you, but it was not my place.
I kept going down
Because I knew you were going to check that
But you were silent as a mouse
It made me think it wasn't your house
Because she was acting like a nut
What kind of pimp stops
I never knew a bitch that a pimp can't slap
What about the pimp?
Why do you have a whiplash?
Can you control me ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yourself
She is stubborn and just won't obey
Can you control me ho?
You have to know what to do and what to say
Listens
You gotta put that bitch in her place
You have to control your ho ..
Can you control me ho?
This is what you made me do
I really didn't want to get my hands on you
I am so sick and tired
Of noisy whores like you
A nigga had to go and give you advice
Because bitch you're playing with fire
I am so sick and tired
This is what you made me do
I really didn't want to get my hands on you
But, bitch, you're playing with fire
I am so sick and tired
Of noisy whores like you
So a nigga had to go and give you advice
Because bitch you're playing with fire
Can you control me ho?
You got a bitch, that won't do what you say
You can't control yourself
She is stubborn and just won't obey
Can you control me ho?
You have to know what to do and what to say
Listens
You gotta put that bitch in her place
Even if it's slapping her in the face
I've been across America
The same hoes on different days
Just ask my great friend Snoop from Snoop
Xxxxx you're not cute, with all that (woop de woop)
I could shake you, I'm not afraid to explode
Grab the heater and hit your butt
Xxxx back, clap automatically
Now this is how a gangster squashes
Coupé friends, Snoop and me in the glass house.
Chorus: Snoop
Yeah, and all my niggas say ... ride, ride
Yes, and all the awards say ... keep going
(repeat 2X except the last line)
I'm out of paper, count the bundle of paper a little bit of xxxxxxx and move
I take a trip with my click on a three-day cruise.
Whip the corner in the fo ', sit low get low
Now we head to the sto 'en fo', the hoes shout
Top dollar with gold flea necklace
Dippin on my blue Impala
They say Snoop Dogg is a fool, because he got the bitches
And the little homebody selling high school grass
I never break the law, I just bend it
Keep everything splendid, that's how I intend
The class is in session, you may be suspended (shhhh)
If you don't close the xxxx UP and listen for a minute
I have been for life, with two children and a wife.
No tattoos, just stress and streaks, so
I do what I feel and I do what I like
But I won't go to sleep without my heater at night (keep going)
Chorus
Nigga, give me everything you have in your hat
To your contacts, t-shirt to your socks
Dogg Pound Affiliate? Hell naw nigga
Cedar Paul Nigga Certified Brand
Mashin, gray and blue all day.
All night heated with heaters, mac-11
I have a xxxxx that gobbles dicks like steak
Close to one of those xxxxxxx is correct, hide the helicopter
DPology (DPG) but first call Snoop
What big homey niggas with the swoop
When we get there we will shake everything xxxxxxxxxxxx
Hit the nail on the head like a raid, one of the friends has an indicator
Come on
Chorus
Let me yell at everyone for a minute, man
I mean, this game is getting too deep
We got niggas that twist
I mean, xxxxxxxxxxxxx you know you think DPG
Niggas walking and xxxx as free agents
And only go when they want
Nigga, this is not a game, this is a damn way of life
DPGC, Dogg Pound Gangsta ... black!
Blacks are straight trying to put a little twist (holla to them)
But you know we try to be two steps ahead of the game, baby, you know?
Let me yell at everyone for a minute, especially YOU
You stepped on some shit Dogg, check your shoes
Nigga, this is not Hollywood, the house of the blues
It's the Dogg House, so regroup your troops
And tell them ... it's Kurupt and Snoop
It's Don Corleone in the chronic zone.
I turn your dubbing into five cents, while I'm relaxed
I melt your rhymes on icicles, while I kill
Sell them, I tell them, Kurupt, what's up?
I know you want to deliver it
We can't stop, we won't stop, what enemy
Because every other day another nigga tries to pull a dulo
Everything was bad, I thought everything was good
A nigga had to take a breath
Now I am living alone, like Khadijah, because they will squeeze you
Xxxx a food fish, I put my dick in your bitch
Nigga, that's gangsta shit, with the gangsta twist
Yes, Dogg Pound gangsta ...
Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle
(Ladies and gentlemen!)
Came in the door like whoa
Lift up
I can't even see more (no more, no more)
Somebody pull the wool
Surround myself with loved ones
Later for them the haters
And now I'm going to upload
On an escalator
You may think that I'm acting completely new
Everyone needs to hold on
I'm just trying to give you something new
I'm a different boy
They keep holding me back to what I used to do
Stop being critical
Leaving the middle
I have changed
It was different when you found me
Changed everything around me
Now you're looking at a different me
Changed
Down for so long
Down for so long
But now I'm way up, way up
I have changed
It was different when you found me (so different)
I changed everything around me (yes, yes)
I'm not the same (me, me, me)
Down for so long
Down for so long
But now I'm way up, way up
I tried to do it my way
(That doesn't work, that doesn't work)
(That doesn't work, that doesn't work)
(That doesn't work, that doesn't work)
Hanging out with the wrong friends
(That doesn't work, that doesn't work)
(Jazze Phizzle)
Get out of your feelings
Come down with the most real thing
And you don't even need a ticket
You can't accuse me of anything
Some people say i did
Raise your hands if you feel me
I represent it
Everyone knows that my praise is unrelenting
Coulda swore she was having the best time of my life
Was appearing
It was popping up (Turn it! Turn it! Turn it!)
I had to turn it around
Turn my mistakes into rights
I had to resign
I had to resign
Ladies and gentlemen
Now you're tuned
(Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle Phizzle)
Maybe (maybe)
Elvis black
Ayy!
(I changed but I'm not changing!)
Hears! I got the compliment!

Rhyme a rhyme and play this
Drinking silver satin as we smoke on the pinhead
A sofa was a black bed
Mary kept a fed black
Twenty-first a black, yes, that's where a black lives
I'm in GA and I fuck D.A
Why? Because they traffic with the easy friend
And just because they didn't know what (Whasup)
I'm on a damn mission to climb, climb

And all I want for Christmas is forty city hoppin '
It's too much to ask, oh no
And I heard on the east side that you spend to get some dough
So when you have your funk go to the store

Verse 3
Everyone in my family is nervous and waiting
How can I be patience?
They are not going to the station
So it all comes down to some inspiration
Interpretation, the conversation he had with the judge.
We are living in a world
And if you're not in the game
So I suggest you rearrange
Because the change is gone, come
And it's not waiting for anyone
For all the drama I did, I went through
To take this to you
You can't be because since DP
LB-B.S chronic in my chest
With a picture of what gangstas drink
And LBC keeps singing everyone, DP playing everyone
We and we all face everything
Times to live
Snoop Dogg again and you know I'm just giving up

Yes i am blessed oh yes

That's probably why I'm blessed and highly favored
Fuck that bitch nigga. My name is Sam Sneed, you must recognize

Coming out of them in these crocodiles Now or Later
Me and Kurupt with my sale to the flat
I have a lot of gasoline but I don't know which way to go
I'm trying to find a white bitch, a snow bunny
Because the word on the streets is that they like to give money to a nigger
(Me and Big Snoop nothing more than some players
Tryna cracks, active with action
The police are on my cock because they are all on my face
Put some yola on a nigga and then they run in my place
I have that in the trunk, 3 cases in a month
I don't give a shit; Kurupt, let me understand that
(Because we just try to get it; the money and the game
Entering this motherfucker, talent tucker, undercover, bang
And then bustin 'on these undercover busts
Only for G in the game, rolling over them thangs)
Bitch, you can lick; you can have a blowjob

Braids in my hair, super dome, super head
Said I had to lick it, I wanted it to
(Yeah, I heard I was the best at it; chewing on it like spinach
Chew it until it's done; man this bitch is not a trick
She is a professional, super ho, she has that super throat)
Living alone, jibbin 'on the phone
Forgiving when you're wrong
Listen to me spit it out with this meditation
(Hey, let's get this money, bitch
I got the crocodile now or later in gangsta shit
Just a little, listen to this shit
Just a little game spitting on this bitch)
Bitch, you can lick; you can have a blowjob

Until I threw that game on your table
Now they do anything for me if they can)
My little friend told me when I was 20 years old.
I'm in love with a bitch, I told her to fuck
Look, I'm your role model with a happy dog bottle
Putting paint where it is not, breaks a bitch; do you think i can't?
(I'm just hard on the paint, I'll do what you can't
Pimpin makes a bitch pass out; I'm a circle and then straight
Get the gat, get the nigga tape, 9, 38
Bitch, you can lick; you can have a blowjob

West Coast
So come on and check it out before tearing yourself apart
You better check yourself before you break
Throwing bombs on you mothers kill the car alarms
Commit a filthy crime, I'm the alpine's brother
And friends know, we have the Indo
I'm not an asshole, sitting in the house of pain
Headbutt already, just so you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch you, punk, you're an asshole
I do drugs, but don't call me an idiot
And hit you, throwing that yak up to your neck
So you better run a check
Come check your girl before she rips you apart
Chizzy-check yourself before you tear yourself apart
West Coast
Chickity-check, yes
Mmm ... yeah, better check your silly car
Yeah you too ... bitch
The tricks want to go to Snoop and then they are played (why?)
That's a little silly, because it's a knife, AK-47 assault rifle
Hold 50, I'm resourceful, how? has a new style
I hate when the suckas say they're turning the bank
First you want to take a step towards me, and now you're screaming for the deputy
They send you Charlie Baker [?]
Dear God, it used to be Don Juan, and now your name is just twan
Changing it, hitting it, rolling your eyes
You better write a check
So check it out before you tear yourself apart
Come check it out before you screw it up
So, check yourself before you screw up
Big D's in your mouth, it's bad for your health
West Coast
Chickity-check, yes
Mmm ... yes, BC powder, yes
See, my priority is to keep it on the west coast right now
In fact, my priority is the west coast ... yes
If you're gross, you better run a mark on that board
You could've had a V8, instead of a trey 8 slug on your skull
Will I blow you up or keep you guessing?
F-U-N that noise stresses you out
Trick, get out of the woods, you're not good, there goes the neighborhood
Rat, go ahead and keep your giveaways
At a time like this, pop ya coochie and you already did
The girl is a head of Mi-ami Hurr-icane
Suddenly friends call her lips and lungs
Diaper unearthed, you should come out
Because women like you have no respect
Trick, you better run a check
So check it out before you tear yourself apart
Chizzy-check yourself before you tear yourself apart
Come check it out before you screw it up
Yes, chick check
Yes it bloats the grass
Come check it out before you screw it up
So check it out before you tear yourself apart
Chizzy-check yourself before you tear yourself apart
In my hour of need
Say I'm not abandoned
Shower on me
All your patience
My stone is not ready
I've been a sinner for a while now
All your forgiveness
I may not deserve it
It's okay to let your flaws show
Nobody is perfect
It's hard for me to bend down
My hood, holy land
Street war for fun
Taught to walk through hellfire with kerosene
So fast to get it up a little
Low profiles, turning, burning the batch
I always have that new thing popping up your block
I always shoot in car, hard to stop
I'm kind of like a work in progress
Anyone already know
Pray for me
Let it chisel away
Let it chisel away
Please believe
He is working on me
Heavenly Father, let me lead by example
Let me be your servant
Give you the true word that is spoken
Have you heard
Don't be fooled
Realize, understand
Which is not your plan
That it's just God's plan (what?!)
Do you really understand
Close them up, praise them
For all salvation
Give you the compliment
My mistakes, my rights
I put them in your faith
Just love i don't hate
Try to keep us in order
Until we see that day
Watch
Life is how you make it
Reject it, or take it
Be real or pretend
Mistake and be patient
Things get real in the situation, boy
Don't fake it
24/7 trying to get to heaven
Don't try to eat the whole plate
Let it chisel away
Please believe
Keep working on me

Until we meet again
Yes let the music play
Yeah just let the music play right there
Yes go head
Can we have a damn moment of silence?
Taking the bitches out to eat and spending money on these hoes, you know what I'm saying?
I treat a bitch like 7-Up, I never have, I never will
I tell a bitch like this
"Bitch, you without me is like Harold Melvin without the blue notes;
You will never go platinum "
Hello Daz, give me a light, black
Good morning boys and girls, I am your substitute teacher, Mr. Buckwort. Today's topic is what you want to be when you grow up. You, there in the jean shirt, what do you want to be when you grow up?
"I want to be a police officer"
"I would like to be a firefighter"
All right, that's a very good profession too.
"My name is Snoop"
Alright Snoop, what do you want to be when you grow up?
"I want to be a damn hustla, you should ask someone"
I had seen many blacks appear in this game
But they never made it look so good
From sweet cars to bright yellow bras
White gangster walls and wood.
You see, there comes a time in a man's life.
Where you have to choose the game assets
Where everyone knows your name
It's a cold game, I haven't been one for
Jump in and out of range
Maybe an old school synagogue
Spinning the vision that I pass out
You have to, you can, you have to keep rhyming
East Side High enjoying life, hair blowing in the wind
The state I'm in is the gangster's bliss
This is what you call a sister
Fast passing them, lost memories
In fact, I got better, holding on to Beretta
Blowing a gooey, turn it into itself
And I will never be questioned by a new young fool
Busting its launch, Snoopy D.O. made you walk
I owe it to the almighty, without you it couldn't be done
Your praise put the birth of the son, do you dig?
Keep my hands closer to my throne
And I will never be crucified within my own zone
From almost falling for murder in '93
I changed, I got smarter, I have a daughter
Two children, beautiful wife to start
I did it all, Jack, exploiting these peas
Eating international cuisine abroad, yes
You never tried to meet Calvin, you tried to make me mad
I did so much shit down the coast, I should get a check
But overall, I did it, B, cool as a blind man with a C
Level my life as I drive away the groupies
Snoopin 'in a coopin', you can call me Uncle Snoopy
Take advantage of your possibilities, even from L, B, C
For you you are the C
Haler you are the Snoopy
And now it's time to make a change
I have to make that move
I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
I have to make that move
There is a time and a place for everything
I paid my dues
And now it's time to make a change
I have to make that move
There is a time and a place for everything
And now it's time to make a change
I have to make that move
There is a time and a place for everything
Take advantage of your possibilities, even from L B C
For you you are the C
Haler you are the Snoopy
Haler you are the Snoopy
That you had to trust like this and pray like this
You may feel that all you did is go too far (go too far)
I just want you to know that God is not tripping over your clothes
He is more concerned with your soul and your heart.
I don't have a heaven or hell to have you on my friend
(He loves us all) Yes, he does (He loves me, He)
So give it your heart, it's a very good start
And come as you are
It doesn't matter if you're from the street
Repent your sense of honesty
Just come as you are (Come as you are)
You don't have to drive a fancy car or dress like a movie star
Just come as you are (Come as you are)
Here's a voice
Rejoice and make a joyous noise
Come as you are (Come as you are)
Give it all the glory, we can live and tell the story.
Wherever you come from, * let's raise our hands like one *
He will tell us well done, we are all his daughters and sons
Let's make the world so much better
Just come as you are
I know, you told him you were leaving
I know, they called you pagan
I know, and no one said wait, kid, don't go
I know, you know what to believe
I know, and the teacher is not teaching
I know, yes (you know)
I know when you wake up
You know, it's not your own air that your breathing
You know, when you think about it, that's what brought you
It doesn't matter if you're from the street
Repent your sense of honesty (Repent and be honest)
(Come as you are) (yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)
You don't have to drive a fancy car (no, no), or dress like a movie star (hey)
Rejoice and make a joyous noise (A)
Come as you are (Come as you are) (Come as you are)
Give it all the glory, (yes) we can live and tell the story (yes, ah, ah)
Come on, come as you are (Come as you are) (Come as you are)
Wherever you come from, * let's raise our hands like one *
And praise the Lord together
He will tell us well done, we are all his daughters and sons
Just come as you are
Everyone is welcome
There is room for everyone
Why we sing this song
It could be you, if you want to come
Everyone is welcome (oh yeah)
It could be you, if you want to come (come on, come on)
Could you bring your problems (like us)
I know we can solve them (we could)
(Please please)
You can come get it from wherever you are
Come oh, just come as you are
(If you are from the street)
Repent your sense of honesty
(Just turn around and see how you are)
You don't have to drive a fancy car
(It doesn't matter what you drive)
Or dress up like a movie star
(It matters what you are wearing)
He loves you
Someone loves you
Come ooo, come ooo

Yes yes sir
Somebody loves you (yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)
Come home
Come home now, (yes, yes, yes, yes)
Come on
I told the bitch I'd cry for you
I would die for you, I lied to you
But getting the pussy is all I tried to do
I'll ride you rolling next to you
You know you want to fuck me
Bitch my name is Kurupt
Yes, see you with the crew
I want to fuck him
I want to fuck him
And what's your name? Devante Swing ...
And that's K-Ci, and that's my brother Dalvin ...
And that's Jo-Jo, so what's going on?
I see it as a photo, everything is on my mind
(I want uhhhh - ahhhh) Pumpin like the old days
Bitch you got your hooks on me like the O'Jays
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
Come to my room
I recognize you
You were in the hotel lobby
You looked damn good
I was sweating at the after party
I wanted you to go crazy with me
Save your mom's message
I don't need drama
A piece of mind
A piece of mind
So don't waste time
From behind
In your eye
I don't know what I'll do
When you come to my room
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
I feel a little lonely tonight
I need someone to do me so well
(I'm looking for a woman, I'm looking for my baby)
Don't be afraid to come to my room
Just get ready to stay until noon
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
Inside let me run
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
If you come, it ends ...
Come to my room
If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
If you come, it ends ...

If you come, it ends ...
Inside let me run
If you come, it ends ...

Even Jes' ora, hey, with difficulty comes ease
There is disease, poverty, congestion, or oppression.
I ask for your protection and I thank you for your blessing
Confession is good for the soul, this is how I try to roll
Be one of the greats, look at the pearly gates now that that's the goal
Until then, forgive my sin if that's not asking too much
Now that it's a tabernacle, chuuuch!
West side, it's 187 on a damn hook
I was shot in the neck trying to escape
And for surveillance it is nothing more than a game of weapons
HEEY!
Got a little static for some niggas across town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What do you want from us, you fucking niggas thugs?
Niggas making songs, trying to reach us
You must go through the grass of stress, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! So we ride until the sun comes up
Returning to brighten the sky, how many die?
I heard the Fugees trying to make me, look, bitch!
I cut your face, this is not a damn movie
Entertaining castrated in my fucking side show
BAM! Set my plan on mo ', time to exterminate my enemies
I can't bear your hoes, uhh
Now tag this fucking trick
Black to catch this nigga, I'm ready to peel one
Instead of the shoulders, I have to distort the grill from a black
Vigilante and villains and niggas of the regime come with weapons of steel
Get ready to sleep because you stumbled when you fucked a villain
Shady Pacino turned C-ho when I grabbed that N9ne
Me and my nigga mezzole C-Bo Yuk we didn't just pop that rhyme
We can make it illegal for the evil to go to hell next time

Shattered like Vell Bakardy, yeah nigga had enough
Nigga, Tech N9ne Killer Klown
Nigga six feet underground is where you stand
Nigga, 40-Water would never make a song with you if I knew the song
It was about me, never make a million
Next time say my name, say my name as Destiny's Children - bitch
Come take a trip through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain
Nigga, time to die, say goodbye
So just before you die you bow to a bigger nigger
Now dry your eyes, you were ruthless with your punches
Blacks love to scream peace after they start some shit, pay attention
Here's a word for those who stole from me
I kill you and then I run a train in Mobb Deep!
Don't fuck with me!
Nigga, you barely live, don't you have a sickle?
Watch me have an attack on stage, you don't feel good, hell
How many niggas wanna participate?
But I'll kill them all, then ball
So tell Da Brat to keep his mouth shut
You know what I meant, every damn word
When We Ride On Our Enemies
Buck these niggas, I'm a murderer screaming 'regime
Navis deep with heat like team A
And when my K screams, it's causing nothing but murder
Countering these niggas making them hate me
Yeah nigga we don't give a shit nigga we kill the lords
Connected from Tech N9ne and touched by the thugs war
Who has love for these loveless niggas?
Not at all give up pistols grabbed

Nigga and we headed for the tied cat
With a fat cat, all my niggas boils down to rat-tat-tat-tat
West Coast, bad boys, we were screaming
Woman - Sir, will you raise your right hand, please? Do you swear and confirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, nothing but the truth, the whole truth?
2Pac - I do
Police: Could you provide your full name for the record?
2Pac - Yes, 2Pac Amaru Shakur
Police - What is your age and residence address?
2Pac: I just turned 24 on June 16. I live in decatur, Georgia
Police - How did you become interested in music?
Police - Secondary, Secondary?
2Pac - Yes, Middle School, High School
2Pac - And the poets I saw when I searched the webs *, I did it personally, but then I started turning poetry into songs and got more attention
2Pac - In my opinion, I was rapping while writing poetry ...
Police - Ok
2Pac - and that's why I liked rap, I guess you could say Junior High, when I wrote my first poems. And after hearing on the radio that there were other poets, who were making records and selling and working, it was then that I decided to change the method of my poetry.
Police: how is rap defined? What constitutes rap?
2Pac - That's what it is for me: poetry. For me it is narrative poetry
Police - To music, music with rhythm?
2Pac - With or without music you can't define rap
Police - But he leaves, sometimes he has a rhythm, a melody, doesn't he, even if he doesn't have accompaniment?
2Pac - No, even a pentameter is rap. It's how you write it, the structure, it depends on how you write it, and if it has a rhythm, I suppose it won't sell as much if you don't have a rhythm; rhythm is more of a sales tool
Police - Now you were playing by the time you made your solo album what people call "gangsta rap".
2Pac - No
Police - Weren't you?
2Pac - No!
2Pac - Rap music!
Police - Have you ever performed gangsta rap?
Police - Well, why would you say that?
2Pac - Because, number one, I don't know what "gangsta rap" is, number two, I wouldn't classify my music as gangsta rap
Police - Have you heard the term?
2Pac - Much!
Police - Ok
2Pac - I didn't say that. Where were you there Oh there. I didn't say that: that's not what he says ... He says: "I am a real victim, everything I speak is real, I really got beaten up, I really don't like it ..." wrote the interviewer. POLICE
Police - You mean "?"
2Pac - No
Police - What did you mean?
2Pac - I really don't like "corrupt police"
Police - All right. So you feel good about another police?
2Pac - Do you feel good?
Police - Do you like another police?
2Pac - I like everyone who only does their job; I mean, it depends, I don't know ... Personally, if I know someone with a good heart *, that's true and fair, then I like them, especially in a position like that, when a person has to put their life online * , and it may still be fair to everyone you know, I definitely like them, and I admire that ...
Police: Do you know others who shot a police officer, especially teens who shot police after listening to them?
Lawyer - "after listening allegedly"
2Pac - NO
2Pac - But none of them said this until you guys started saying this, put it on all the news, and had Danny Quayle * say it.
Police - I ask you, do you know others?
2Pac - No, NO!
Police - When did you start receiving emails from fans? Do you remember what year?
2Pac - No, no
Police - Did I hear you say you also received unfavorable mail?
2Pac - Yes, like this! I got a lot of mail from you ...
2Pac - No! From "you": YOU, the lawyers ... lawsuits *
Police - What else, did you receive unfavorable mail?
2Pac - In my entire career, I think I received 5 pieces of hate mail. Of all the mail I have received, I have received only about 5 pieces, maximum
2Pac - I replied to your hate mail ...
Police: have you ever used illegal drugs?
2Pac - Marijuana, yes
Police - How often have you used marijuana?
2Pac - In all my life? At what point in my life?
Police - Let's say after 17?
Lawyer: I'm going to tell the witness * not to talk about the use or possession of illegal substances: I don't think it's relevant to this: he admitted that he used it
Police: I think it is absolutely relevant. You're trying to distinguish him as a child from the chorus * and I'm trying to see what he's really done.
Lawyer: I have not made it anything
2Pac - You're trying to make me a demon!
Police: Was your intention to try to make young black men violent towards the police?
2Pac - No
Police - Did you try to provoke someone into doing something in particular? Were you trying to provoke or get people to do things?
2Pac - Yes!
2Pac - Think! Use your head!
Ready nigga? Ready for that black fucking dog?
Ayy, I'm afraid to do a little freestyle.
I'm too high and I could miss a beat
My game runs, 2 Pacalypse doesn't sleep
I'm still with a damn Glock in my car
If I'm staying in the club, I have to be the fucking star
Because you know how blacks are, they want to see
If Pac is real or is like that nigger in the movie
I think I have to prove my point
Cutting motherfuckers, now I'm doing the joint
I got my nigga B-I to G next to me
Bitches on my dick, you know your hoes wanna ride me
And my other friends here like Spike Lee
They have the camera in black, I guess they like me
But now I'm about to move on to this motherfucker
Because this Tanqueray is getting very strong
Blunt smoke coming out of the nose is all a black knows
Turning enemies over, putting labels on their toes
Watching the stash grow, recording the cash flow
The neighborhood gravedigger
They pay me so much that all bitches wanna see a nigga
I guess they thought they pay me, I want to get laid
Or since I got the loot, I wanna touch boots
Huh, I'd rather beat my cock than trick
And if she doesn't stink, then we don't fuck
Huh, I'd rather lick a dollar, drive a fat truck
Grab all nine, two clips and run them
Yeah flex the 2 or 3 benz ever since I shit the shit
What the fuck did you expect?
Putting the swelling in your eye
And your nose even when I choke you stop breathing
And when the police come, I'll go
Conspiracies
After Tupacs' death, several people reported seeing him in Jamaica.
Suge Knight killed Tupac
In my mind I am a fighter, my heart is a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow ignites it
Arsenic writer, author with arthritis
Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shitting
Dick headed, a flat tire, a big headache. I'm sick.
Quick wit, for every letter spit there are 6 critics
Who expects me to slip so fast
This dynamite cartridge buried the wick, it will explode at any time
A lunatic turned it on and it's not Nelly
Don't tell me to stop screaming, when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling and I'm not felling
You sons of bitches are not ready, because I have jelly, like Beyonce's belly
So get away from me, I'm not slowing down or softening
They send armies to bombard me, constantly armed
The only DJ who can calm me down is constantly armed
My firepower keeps me warm, I'm constantly armed
And fuck the world until I'm gone, constantly armed
They send armies to bombard me, constantly armed
And fuck the world until I'm gone
I will not fall
I'll stay upright
Feel that no one can beat me
Follow me tell me if you feel me
I think niggas are trying to kill me
Picturin pistols, spitting hollow tips until I am drilled
Keeping it real, and even if I hide it
My criminal thoughts, worried about keeping the steel
The word is bonb, you will break
I'm bustin at Guiliani, he rubbed my niggas wrong
I'm spitting punk bitches and Hustlin to be free
Watch me set it up, niggas don't want it, you can get it
I bet these jealous niggas go crazy I said so
This nigga from Thug Life, we don't attend you hoes
Yeah nigga
I like the girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 jeans (baby)
I want it to be you
And my only one
I want to be faithful
But I can't get my hands out of the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my
I can't keep my hands, my hands, my
I can't keep my hands, my hands, my
I can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out of the cookie jar
It's instrumental, waiting for the nymphs, that's the introduction
Shoot when you rush me
I walked and it touched me
Why do you want to fuck me?
Do you like being upstairs or in the back?
Watch me as you lick your lips, shake your hips
Damn, I love that shit!
I have a room and a boner. Still down?
I found you standing in a bar full of black guys
Said you want to see my scars and my tattoos
When we go to my hiding place, act well
What is your phone number?
I like the girls
They look so cute in their 7 jeans
I want it to be you
And my only one
I want to be faithful
But I can't get my hands out of the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my
I can't keep my hands, my hands, my
I can't keep my hands, my hands, my
I have a thing for Milano biscotti Italians
Butter Puerto Rican nut
Or they porridge with Asian raisins
Brazilian hazelnut, Caucasian macadamia
It doesn't matter, you understand
Because i have a sweet tooth
That will never come off
And the fact of the matter is
I like the girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 jeans
I want it to be you
And my only one
But I can't get my hands out of the cookie jar
My hands, my hands, my
I can't keep my hands, my hands, my
I can't keep my hands, my hands, my
I can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out of the cookie jar
I'm a monster for these cookies
I am an animal because they are cookies
I can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out of the cookie jar
Damn. True G. Don't fall asleep nigga, Everyone dies Nigga, everyone dies, We all have to go, we all have to go, Go to sleep, nigga, Go to sleep, Close your damn eyes, We all have to die, Fuck them all X2, Westside MOB
First to bombard, quick to download
Exposing my enemies for being bitches
Keeping blacks suspicious
2 Glocks are full of ammunition
My army uniform is ready for battle.
Tell me nigga, how much can you drive?
Hitting wax
Booom!
My intention specifically
Pulled without sympathy
Images of closed coffins
As soon as Daz is with me (I'm the first to bomb)
First is calm, then panic
As soon as my niggas break
Earthquakes across the planet
The adversaries cannot understand it
The way my niggas strategize
No one dies unless we have planted it
I lived a long time committed, I write songs and then I spit them out
No matter how much motherfuckers try
They can't get it
It's the west coast
Westide, Outlawz until we die, Thug life motherfuckers on the first trip and we're the first to bombard
I have nothing to lose, paying fees
Nigga, do you want to die?
I get high, so my mission is a walk
You better fly when I get to your set
Because I'm coming, start running
Screaming Evil-Mind while I'm shooting
For the anger that I build inside
For the mothers who cried
The beginning is an end.
Am I just a slave?
So i was brave
So many people who feel like me
Who share the same views and exact same beliefs.
It's like a fucking army marching behind me
So many lives that I touched, so much anger directed
And directly through your radio waves, play and play
Until it gets stuck in your head, for days and days
Who would have thought, standing in this mirror bleaching my hair?
With a little peroxide, looking for a shirt to wear
What catapulted me to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict that my words would have an impact like this?
I must have played a chord with someone in the office
Because Congress keeps telling me, I'm causing nothing but trouble
You see I'm making proposals
Full of verbal indecency when you meet me
Flash light i am buzzing
Which is fine like drugs, got 3 hits
You had cause last night for thugs
Holding my position
My competition is never ready
Torn by a machete
My alias is makaveli
So what they tell me through the vine
I went for my voice
Every time a nigga says it rhymes
Spend and burst you thought
But you were not ready
Like Kamikazes on a suicide mission
I'm spitting multiple shots
Burning turning rappers into victims
I kick them all day
(Sound of bullet)
(Suddenly I see some niggas I don't like)
(Got him)
A black smoker stole from me blind
I got a TEC-9 now his steaming ass is mine
I think I felt sorry for the bastard, I was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't see him around
Catch him on the streets, I'm gonna stand him up, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see it coming now
Fuck the shit, get deep and let's run him over
He'll be the first to hit you when we meet
The first one jumped up and said "Freeze!"
Because the cops should be concerned about their business, when we rush
Now you're begging like a bitch, cause you don't know how, silence
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me body
One for the chest, one for its damn dome
Now the shit can rest, tell him to leave me alone
A nosy cop and a nigger who stole from me
Run away from your backup punk, how do you imagine?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked niggas
Twisted Ass Niggas
(Criminal behavior - criminal - criminal behavior)
(Suddenly I see--)
(Cri-cri-criminal)
Now listen to the crooked nigga trade mack
With the fine criminal mind, the cold rips like a blade
It's fast to go niggas with accessories.
A nigga tries to play me like he knows me but no
Sitting in ten kis, I'm going to catch it, do you think not?
My nigga 2Pac has the fucking Glock lopsided and it's ready
When the boy didn't even bring the bag of weights, he
He received us in his apartment.
Oh this is even better, two on his head, he's dead and clean! Niggas received PAYMENT!
And another sleeping nigga was killed, word
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch
The twisted ass niggas
(Criminal behavior)
(Criminal - criminal behavior)
(Suddenly I see some niggas I don't like)
Now it could also be a crooked black
I'm ready to hit the fall, from a whistle
So move around and act like you want to flip
I shoot thirteen shots and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock is like a fucking mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers fell
And even the policemen were shot when they arrived
I'm not the type to look for you, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke until he's drunk, fuck a damn urine test
I'm a happy trigger, try to attack me and I'll drop you quickly
Nigga killer iller me when the shit gets thick
My brain is spinning, I start to think like crazy
I rip shit, I come equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggas knew it, I'm a crooked nigga too
(Criminal behavior - criminal - criminal behavior)
Twisted ass niggas come in all shapes and sizes
They wear costumes, stabbing in the back is what they specialize in
They will try to get 'cha, they will sweat' cha to enter the image
And then they hit 'cha, motherfucker! Now he's richer
(Criminal behavior - criminal-criminal behavior)
Black twisted ass
(Suddenly I see some niggas I don't like)
(Criminal - criminal - criminal behavior
Criminal-crim-criminal behavior (behavior) - criminal behavior
(Criminal behavior- criminal be- criminal crim--
Criminal criminal behavior
Criminal behavior - criminal behavior)
(Suddenly I see some niggas I don't like)
(* machine gun fires)
(Suddenly I see some niggas I don't like)
(* machine gun fires)
(Got him)
(Suddenly I see some niggas I don't like)
(* machine gun fires)
(Got him)
That's right hehehe
Hey, I heard the police hit you
I have a big and fat demand and everything
Yes..
Niggas just wanna know
If you're still gonna be in a crooked black shit
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm angry
A motherfucker from the subway
And Big Stretch buckin 'niggas if they fuck
Why did you fight me with the police?
Isn't she a bitch, motherfuckers quarreled with me?
I wake up to the least bit peep and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
Instead they motherfuckers blame me
I have the right to carry a gun
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then, I have to do what I do
And it's still a crooked black too
It all depends on you, but until then I have to do what I do
And it's still a crooked black too
And maybe then you will see the truth; OOOH!
But until then I have to do what I do and still be a crooked nigger too
And it's still a crooked black too
And maybe then you will see the truth; OOOH!
You know, you really can't say you blame niggas
2Pac will provoke a revolution, fucks the Constitution
I want my dollars for the refund
This time you have a bigger problem
And we're not shooting at each other (fuck no!)
And all the klan bitches
Come feel the wrath of a black man who doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!)
Genuine Draft, ganja ganja and my fucking TEC-9

Blame the Korean ... (fuck) or be a crooked nigger too
It all depends on you, but until then I have to do what I do
But until then I have to do what I do and still be a crooked nigger too
It all depends on you, but until then I have to do what I do
And it's still a crooked black too
You can't fuck with the crew, crooked nigga too
I will be damned if I die, come look at the anger in my eyes G
They have my friends in a jail cell.
And it's the rebel and the devil, and one of us goes to hell
I have the whole place covered, with brothers located
So motherfucker makes a move
I don't give a shit, cut you down and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop; I see that it's great to shoot a nigger
But they hate when we get the police out
You better watch your steps or they'll leave you on death row
But I learn to look in front of me
Stay tied, look at your back, keep your eyes on the enemy
We operate enclosures and OOOH
It all depends on you, but until then I have to do what I do
And it's still a crooked black too
And maybe then you will see the truth, OOOH!
It all depends on you, but until then I have to do what I do

Yo 'Pac yo, I heard the police hit you

Niggas just wanna know
If you're still going to be in a crooked sheeeit
Please tell me what a nigga to do, and it's true
It's not new, so I do what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm angry
A loaded AK-47 lay under my head so I wouldn't trip.
A motherfucker from the subway
And Big Stretch buckin niggas if they fuck
Why did you fight me with the police?
Isn't she a bitch that motherfuckers quarreled with me?
Make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up to the least bit peep and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointing a finger at the police
Instead they motherfuckers blame me
I have the right to carry a gun
And when punk motherfuckers stumble, I shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (hell yeah)
But until then, I have to do what I do
And it's still a crooked black too
I have to do what I'm going to do
I'm going to live as I live, how else do you want a black man to live?
I will do what i do
I'm going to live as I live, how do you want a black to live?
You know, you really can't say you blame niggas
Fuck bein tame, set fire, time to aim triggers
2Pac will provoke a revolution, fucks the Constitution
I want my dollars for the refund
This time you have a bigger problem
Time to take on the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And all the klan bitches
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!)
Genuine Draft, ganja ganja and my fuckin tec-9
They know they are afraid to see us sober
Stop drinking King Cobra, and niggas will take over the world
It all depends on you (depends on you)
Blame the Korean, blame the Jew, or be a crooked nigger too
I have to do what I'm going to do
I'm going to say what I'm going to say

And nuttin but love for each other
So motherfucker makes a move
I don't give a shit, cut you down and throw your ass in the ocean
But they hate when we get the police out
That's when they get gas
You better watch your steps or they'll leave you on death row
But I learn to look in front of me
Stay tied, look at your back, keep your eyes on the enemy
We operate enclosures and OOOH
You can't fuck with the crew, crooked nigga too
I have to do what I'm going to do
I'm going to say what I'm going to say
I'm going to live as I live, how else do you want a black man to live?

It is the coldest city from here to Georgia.

I'm going to say what I'm going to say
I will say what I say
I'm going to live as I live, how do you want a black to live?
I ran outside 2 I feel the rain
and I stayed outside awhile
When the rain ended the sun came
and this was Cupid's smile!
Shit, tired of getting shot
Tired of being chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a place where we can kick it
A place where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas don't have to dress up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
There's no heaven for a nigga thug
Why we go to the thugs mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in for free and you have to be a G
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to rest
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry sometimes
I once contemplated suicide, and I tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mom's eyes.
No one knows my fight, they only see the problem
Imagine me in the misery of poverty
No living man has witnessed the struggles I survived
Pray for better days, promise to hold on
We found a familiar place to kick it
Where can we drink liquor and nobody argue about shit tricks
A place where we can smoke in peace, and although we are G
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind I see this place, the players come in fast
I have a place for all of us, so we can play in the bully's mansion
I will see you when you get there
If you ever get there
See you when you get there
If you ever get there
Will I survive all the fighting and the dark?
The problem sparks, they tell me that home is where the heart is, dear deceased
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep well
For several years, fellow witnesses capture shots
Nobody cares, we saw politicians ban us
They prefer to see us locked in chains, please explain
Why can't they bear us? Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of the things I did to keep?
I need a place to rest
With the little boys left, cause all the rest to be dead
Is there a place for us to roll if you find it?
I'll be right behind you, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I come from below
Watch my dad yell "Peace" while the other man shot him
I need a house full of love when I need to escape
Deadly places throw drugs, in the bully's mansion
Dear mom, don't cry, your baby is fine
Tell friends I'm in heaven and they don't have hoods
Sitting there kicking with Malcolm, until the day came
Little Latasha sho 'grew
Tell the liquor lady that she's forgiven, so come home
That happened, they in heaven, found peace at last
Imagine a place where they exist, together
There must be a better place than this, in heaven
So just before sleep, dear God, what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place, in the bully's mansion
Times of danger, times of danger, times of danger, times of danger
Times of danger, times of danger, times of danger, times of danger
It's lit, a corpse found wrapped in the carpet
No movies or clubs, because they will surely catch you
In the mix, running through your life, time to get home
Look at someone dumb caught straight to the dome
For no reason, death is still the season.
People are running frantic, because the shots keep ringing
These damn thugs just won't stop the gun
Having fun these days, you have to wear a vest
1-2-5 in the summer like the wild west
Something jumps out of a black cap, everyone's cap
Worst of all is that every fucking body is tied up
All you can do is cross your fingers and hope you're lucky
But if I'm fine when the shooting stops, I'm not in the blood
Hop on my journey, trying to slide with these scared thugs
Wherever we go, danger is never out of sight
What the hell is wrong with God? Pass the indo
What the hell are they killing about Nintendo?
So you can die later if you don't die today
Crying mothers, I can't understand it
I try to release hip hop when I rap lines
But every time I try, it ends up being a crime
Turn on the news, it's like we're living in a war
No one to trust, the cops are the damn thieves
These days, they don't go for the books
Proceed with caution, if you are not, you are lost
Let yourself twist, the last thing on your mind
Caught you boy, living in these times of danger
It is that reality (Dan's times of danger ...)
It is that reality (Dan's times of danger ...)
It is that reality (Dan's times of danger ...)
It is that reality (Dan's times of danger ...)
I'm riding through the back streets
Hitting the black beats, stop where the niggas sell crack
Say what about the dealers in my neighborhood
Niggas rollin 'cee-lo, local car thieves
Narcos crossing, they want to lock us in the way
But the niggas in the backseat look like a snitch
Police hooked, looking like a little bitch
I can't get caught in the mix
For these troublesome fake cops and crooked ass tricks
And uh, wait, niggas rolling, what for?
I don't know, but they were broken, so I care
Pop a man in his damn dome had to pull chrome
When the smoke cleared, I see that my man was dead
And the policemen on the corner, then a muthafucka fled the scene.
It has to be a dream, I'm upset
I stood up on the scene, looking like a damn fool, damn muthafucka
Make it from the streets
For the first jump, I put my hand on my heat
It is that reality (Dan's times of danger ...)
It's that reality (Dan's times of danger ...) [nigga, times of danger]
It is that reality (Dan's times of danger ...)
It is that reality (Dan's times of danger ...)
Will I live or die?
I don't know because they are strange times
I'm too high to read the muthafuckin warning signs
And you're mad because I don't want to call you, bitch
Now stop being quick to flip
My niggas dying for a short time, triflin 'shit
So I don't have time for this, you know what it is
About a black man's nuts making a lot of money
The best of New York, coming right behind us
Mind turning from the Moet a nigga is drinking
Crowd on the scene with the Queens Squad
Drinkin 'Hennessy, the damn cops are green
In addition to the mini 14 for punks with funk
Drop the trunk on those silly bitches, blow 'em up punks
It is that reality (Dan's times of danger ...)
It is that reality (Dan's times of danger ...)
It is that reality (Dan's times of danger ...)
It is that reality (Dan's times of danger ...)
Looking at the world through my rearview mirror
Go baby scream to god he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast because it's time to die
Reaching observation time fly
Why will we do it?
Looking at the world through my rearview mirror
I can feel your heart beating fast because it's time to die
Reaching observation time flies, you know?
Looking at the world through my review
And all my motherfuckers
Looking through my rearview mirror
Go baby scream to god he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast because it's time to die
Come on baby, follow me guide
Multiple shots fill the block, the fun stops
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me and then they lie to me
Product of a dying breed
All my friends trying grass
Now the crazed little baby got up from Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies run away when they see me?
And we turn bad boys into grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt and let me light it for you
A love from a black thug
Rollin 'with a gang full of paranoid drug dealers
Until the end my friend
I don't see anything but my dreams come true
While I'm looking at the world through my rearview mirror
While I'm looking at the world through my rearview mirror
Looking at the world through my rearview mirror
Come on, baby, shout to God, he can't hear you
And all my motherfuckers
Looking at the world through my rearview mirror
Come on, baby, shout to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast because it's time to die
Getting high, watching the time fly
Come on, baby, shout to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast because it's time to die
Getting high, watching the time fly
And all my motherfuckers
To receive payment, forced to make crack sales
I caught a nigga so they sent me to these jails full
In the cell, counting days in this living black hell
Do you feel Me? Ignition keys, use at your discretion
Niggas hate me in the chin checkup years section
Head to the weapons of war Smith & Wesson
I'm getting hotter because the world is getting colder
Baby let me hold you
Everything you want better to run, look at my bitches!
Now I know the answers to the question.
"Dreams come true?"
Still looking at the world through my rearview mirror
I said I now know the answers: "Do dreams come true?"
Looking at the world through my rearview mirror
I can feel your heart beating fast because it's time to die
Getting high, watching the time fly
Looking at the world through my rearview mirror
Come on, baby, shout to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast because it's time to die
Getting high, watching the time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Looking at the world through my rearview mirror
Come on, baby, shout to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beating fast because it's time to die
Getting high, watching the time fly
And all my motherfuckers

Makin 'my grits and trying to get my mail
So fuck a cop, they'll drop him if he takes the wrong step
I'm the bad guy, everyone points to me
But fuck off, everyone, as long as the retouchers are happy
Doing my cash flow, but how long will it last?
Pimp is not easy but I still leave your ass broken
Pass the vapors as the papers will arrive
I give the cuts and I don't give a shit about being a friend
Because a bitch will be a bitch, no matter what you say
That's why I fuck 'em, break a nut and I'm on my way
As soon as I'm done I'll be glad I fucked a whore
But fuck bitch, I keep my mind on my drink cause I

Fuck it, I didn't want to go to heaven anyway
But my mom put me on my knees with my hands clasped
Speaking of some "praise the Lord" shit
God save you, fuck her, I never knew her
Probably screw her and throw her body into the sewer
Big, black and evil, with Gabardine's fifth
What you expected from your relatives, huh?
I'm crazy brother, but I'm not Mexican
Got nine in the room, Glocks in the kitchen
Smith & Wesson's lesson is depressing
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
Follow me tell me if you feel me
I think niggas are trying to kill me
Imagining guns, spitting hollow tips until I get drilled
Keeping it real, and even if I hide it
My criminal thoughts, worried about keeping the steel
That used to be real, but now they're petrified bitches
I'm bustin 'on Giuliani, he rub my niggas wrong
And then it lights up, before you let me imagine
I'm spitting punk bitches and fighting to be free
Watch me set it up, niggas don't want it, you can get it
I bet these jealous niggas go crazy I said so
This nigga from Thug Life, we don't attend you hoes
Fuck me, have a hundred motherfuckers in your 'do'
With fo'-fo's, hahaha
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
I'm that young, pretty, pretty, glorious child
A bad boy, like Notorious B.I.G
With more game than Ron Harper
Bomb rapper slash bomber charm thief
As long as you guys are in the corners, bulky and high
I'm out buying the best shit that money can buy
You wish you were in a position where I am
Every week, bring a different car
I go to clubs and buy the bar
Uh, because I keep cream, I'm big on the street scene
Every time I play microphones, you hear all the monsters scream
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
With Ron G blessing me with the hype, nigga
You know the taste, you know I love to misbehave
Yeah nigga
Thug Life, the waterbed, deadly combination
It's the black heat
Now rewind this motherfucker, you know you can't help it

When I was young, my mom and I ate beef
Seventeen years, expelled in the streets.
Although at the time I never thought I would see his face
Suspended from school and afraid to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breaking all the rules
I shed tears with my little sister, over the years
We were poorer than the other little boys
And even though we had different dads, the same drama
When things went wrong, we would blame mom
I remember the stress I caused, it was hell
Hugging my mom from a jail cell
And who would think elementary school, hey
Would I see the prison someday?
And running away from the police, it's true
Mom catch me put a shriek on my butt
And even like a crack demon, mom
You were always a black queen, mom
It is not easy for a woman to try to raise a man
You were always engaged
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There is no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Sweet lady, don't put anyone above you (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?
Now nobody tells us it was fair
There is no love from my dad, because the coward was not there
He passed away and I didn't cry because my anger
I was looking for a father, he was gone
And even though they sold drugs
They showed love to a young brother
I moved in and really started hanging up
I needed my own money, so I started slandering
I am not guilty, because although I sell rocks
It feels good to put money in your mailbox
I love paying the rent when the rent is due
I hope you have the diamond necklace that I sent you
‘Because when I was low, you were there for me
You never left me alone, because you loved me
And I could see you come home after work late
But now the road has become difficult, you're alone
You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there is no way I can pay you back, but my plan
It is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Lady, don't you know that we love you? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, don't put anyone above you (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love you?
Pour some liquor and remember
‘Because through drama I can always depend on my mom
And when it seems that I have no hope
You say the words that can refocus me
When I was sick like a little boy
You're full of all the sweet things you did for me
I must thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel.
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can spend the night, there is a brighter day
Everything will be fine if you hold on
It is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Lady, don't you know that we love you? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, don't put anyone above you (you are appreciated)
Sweet lady, lady (dear mom)
Lady lady
Mom, yeah ...
When I was young, my mom and I ate beef

Would I see the prison someday?
And running away from the police, it's true
And even like a crack demon, mom
You were always a black queen, mom
I finally understand
It is not easy for a woman to try to raise a man
You were always engaged
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There is no way I can pay you back, but the plan
It is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Mom ... (Dear Mom)
Dear Mom ... (You are appreciated)
Mom, yeah ...
Now nobody tells us it was fair
There is no love from my dad, because the coward was not there
He passed away and I didn't cry because my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I don't have a heart, but all the time
I was looking for a father, he was gone
I stayed with the bullies
And even though they sold drugs
They showed love to a young brother
I moved in and really started hanging up

I hope you have the diamond necklace that I sent you
‘Because when I was low, you were there for me
And you never left me alone, because you loved me
And I could see you come home after work late
You're in the kitchen, trying to fix us a hot plate
You only work with the leftovers they gave you
And mom did miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road has become difficult, you're alone
You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own
And there is no way I can pay you back, but my plan
It is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated
Mom ... (Dear Mom)
Dear Mom ... (just so you know, you are appreciated)
Mom, yeah ...
Pour some liquor and remember
‘Because through drama I can always depend on my mom
And when it seems that I have no hope

To keep me happy, there is no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
You're full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I must thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel.

Mom, yes ... (Dear mom)

Mom ... Dear Mom ...
You are appreciated
When I was young, my mom and I ate beef

Isn't there a living woman who can take my mom's place?

Sweet lady
I Jackson! (A 231549)
Yes, close four! Going down!
All penitentiary centers
Yes
A thug, a thug (How do we keep the music playing?)
You're listening to the sounds of one, thuuug
A bully, a bully (How do we go?)
Shoots fantasize photos of a buried young brother
If the day is for fools, tonight we breathe
For all that, knowing that this world brings inconveniences
See how they tremble once I deliver these raw raps
Tonight we honor the dead, those who will not return
An outlaw, thug living in this game for years
Why worry, wait for God, rise when I'm buried?
Deep down knowing only a few love me
How I lived my days as a child; Now i wonder
How do we last longer? We always receive cash
Stay strong if we all puree, hold your head
How do we keep the music playing (yeah you gotta hold your head)
How do we get ahead ... (keep your head!)
Too many young black brothers are dying (yeah you gotta grab your head)
Hahaha
These crimes are like prophecies that beg me to stop
Because these lawyers get money every time they hit us
I changed my name to Makaveli, half the ghost of the rap game
Enemies exposed with my hocus pocus streams froze
Now fools idolize my chosen punches
And more money means litigation, more beach hatin
Make them understand me? heck no this is not my group
All who are with me are familiar, because they all have me
We all meet in jail ...
Last week I received a letter from my stray dog, written in blood
Hold him
In fact, enemies bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be the last for my unborn seeds
I hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
Money makes you jealous, take my game away
I hope for better days, the problems come naturally
Running from the authorities until they capture me
And my goal is to spread more smiles than tears
Use lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe mom had it all right, rest your head
Direct conversations all night, bless the dead
To the friends I used to have that don't roll anymore
Catch a brother at the crossroads ..
Also, nobody knows my soul, watching time pass
Through the glass of my deployable Rolls, hold your head!
No matter how hard it is, feel me
Look at the stars, get some cunt, whatever ...
I wouldn't be a damn thang without a woman
What did you say about my mother, man?
What did you say about my mother, man?

Child: Why are you by the window? What's up Daddy?
Mother: I know what happens to that crazy son of a bitch.
He just stands by the damn window
With that damn AK all day (there you have it)
You don't even do a damn thing
I see death around the corner, I have to stay high while I survive
In the city where skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me like a nigga G, no need to worry
I see death around the corner, any day
Keep my finger on the trigger, mercilessly in my eyes
In a ball of confusion I'm thinking of my dad
Crazier than a motherfucker, they should never have had me
I guess I saw too many murders, doctors can't help me.
I got stressed with my gun on my sheets, it's not healthy
Am I paranoid? - Tell me the truth
I'm out of the window with my AK, ready to shoot
I ran out of strength and my mind can't bear the stress, I'm out of breath
Make me want to kill my damn person; but I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
("When we were kids, belonging felt good ..")
I see death around the corner
("But having respect, that feels even better ...")
I no longer trust my friends, those fakes tried to make me
Smoking too much weed, made me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest, under my clothes when I get dressed
Here I hope he dies the way he lived, directly killing
Hugging my trigger for all the niggas that were teasing
They face like they're friends but they're fake motherfuckers
All I got were bad cups and cold looks
I have friends in my head who passed away screaming "Please!"
Young nigga, make G's
I can't give up, even though I'm desperate, I think my mind is gone
All I can do is keep going, death just around the corner
("When we were kids, belonging felt good ..")
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
("But having respect, that feels even better ...")
(I was raised) I was raised in the city, shit
Since I was a little boy
And smoking marijuana was an everyday thing in my home
And drinking liquor until you're cold
And even though I'm older, nigga is still on - Pow!
Bustin on them niggas until they're gone
How many more jealous bitches that come for my riches?
Now I have to suspect when I got rid
Because if I'm not strong and ruthless, those bitches will start shitting
Excuse me, but this is where we parted, bitch
No more free games, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who did you come to see?
Murder me now, but see you later, man, that's on my paddles
I hope the Lord can forgive me
I was a G and getting high was a way of being free
I see death around the corner
("When we were kids, belonging felt good ..")
I see death around the corner
I see death around the corner
("When we were kids, belonging felt good ..")
("But having respect, that feels even better ...")
I see death around the corner
I know that you are not afraid to die; we all have to go you know
A real son of a bitch will choose the time he leaves
And make sure he runs his damn business
(You think you're going to live long enough to spend that money
Damn hump?)
You all niggas stop acting like pussies out there, alright
They're tired of being scammed by guys like that ...
I want your family dead! I want your house burned to the ground!
I want to go there in the middle of the night I want to pee in his ashes!
I want your family dead! I want your house burned to the ground!
I want to go there in the middle of the night I want to pee in his ashes!
I want him dead, I don't care ...
And that's why we don't do it, I know what I'm doing, I'll destroy them
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What do you want from us, you fucking niggas thugs?
I used to love niggas now, connect niggas and drink niggas
I'm wrong? Niggas Makin songs, trying to reach us
You must go through the grass of stress, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! So we ride until the sun comes up
Shinin back to brighten heaven, many die
I heard the Fugees were trying to make me, look bitch!
I cut your face, this is not a damn movie
SO! We watch the other two die slowly
Entertainment castrated in my fucking side show
BAM! Set my plan on mo ', time to exterminate my enemies
I can't bear your hoes, uhh
Now tag this fucking trick
My lyrics running all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride
And if I die for a slug, the death of a real bully
Tell me, will my niggas cry for me?
The death of a real bully.
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
I never know if this game will last, feeling ashamed
And if I die for a slug, the death of a real bully
Tell me, will my niggas cry for me?
The death of a real bully.
A man of military means in my artillery.
Watching over me at every murder scene
Come take a trip through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain it, nigga, time to die, say goodbye
Look at my eyes when I pull the trigger
You had no heart in your blows
Blacks love to scream peace after they start some shit, pay attention
Here's a word for those who stole from me
I kill you and then I run a train in Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me
Nigga, you're barely living, don't you have sickle cells?
How many niggas wanna participate?
Look, I was just talking to Biggie, but I'll kill everyone, then the ball.
So tell Da Brat to keep his mouth shut
Fuck you and get carried away by the fucking Outlawz
Before I go make sure everyone LISTENS
You know what I meant, EVERY WORD MADREFUCKIN
And if I die for a slug, the death of a real bully
Tell me, will my niggas cry for me?
The death of a real bully.
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
I never know if this game will last, feeling ashamed
And if I die for a slug, the death of a real bully
The death of a real bully.
Watching over me at every murder scene
I was their representative, they would never hurt me.
And if I die for a slug, the death of a real bully
Tell me, will my niggas cry for me?
The death of a real bully.
And if I die for a slug, the death of a real bully
Tell me, will my niggas cry for me?
The death of a real bully.
A man of military means in my artillery.
Watching me through every murder scene
"Nobody closing me from my business"
"Nobody closing me from my business"
My definition of a black bully
I played the cards they gave me, thank God I'm still living
Pack my nine until it's time to go to prison
While I'm going down the block I come from, I still have to pack a gun
Case some young motherfuckers want to play dumb
I guess I live life forever jugglin '
But I will be in a hurry until dawn because I'm fighting
How to drink liquor, make money come faster
Getting pages from my bitch, time to fuck her
This is how it is, time to shake a ho, make the dough
I keep my finger on the trigger of my Glock
Ridin 'by the block licking shots at the punk-ass * cops *
The kind of shit to make hoes get boned
My definition of a black bully
"It is the season, to serve"
"What are you doing'?"
"Mob-mobbin 'like a motherfucker"
"It is the season, to serve"
"Mob-mobbin 'like a motherfucker"
"It is the season, to serve"
"What are you doing'?"
"Mob-mobbin 'like a motherfucker"
"It is the season ... to serve"
Well, I roll with a crew of niggas from the zoo
They're quick to roll a nine when it's time to do niggas
Coming like it's two niggas, a real nigga fucks a Zig Zag
Give me a hard hit and pass that dark beer
I'm driving drunk on the highway, so take it every time
Looking for a new face to overwhelm me
Everyone is looking for a nut, but I'm looking for a lot of money
Fuck it, instead of dying than being trapped
So how's that for a Thug Nigga's mind?
I bought a fo'-five because I heard that the slug is bigger
Imagine that the first son of a bitch to jump will find himself
Pushed by the bomb
I put it to my moms, word for the damn trigger
"It is the season, to serve"
"What are you doing'?"
"Mob-mobbin 'like a motherfucker"
"It is the season, to serve"
"What are you doing'?"
"Mob-mobbin 'like a motherfucker"
"It is the season, to serve"
"What are you doing'?"
"Mob-mobbin 'like a motherfucker"
"It is the season ... to serve"
Shorter than a motherfucker snatched for once
Make a phone call and get back to the ball at lunchtime
So here we go, we in the city center
Blacks don't like me cause I'm finishing
Roll in a Benz and burn a joint, cause I'm all inside
And any niggas who try to take what I have
Hafta dealt with the sixteen shot Glock (huh)
So here we go, I can't fade away
I have my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger
And I'm not taking shit from any niggas
Put some food on my tummy
I feel good like I'm supposed to, ready to dance
Find a place and we can serve you all
My definition of a black bully
"It is the season, to serve"
My definition of a black bully
"It is the season, to serve"
"Mob-mobbin 'like a motherfucker every day"
My definition of a black bully
"Mob-mobbin 'like a motherfucker every day"
My definition of a black bully
"No one closing me from my business" (scratched by Warren G)
I like this
Blastin ', dumpin'
Female dog
I have my gun armed and my knife
'About to cut this black windpipe
Throwing tops, pushing me on the dice
Nigga thought it was nice with the stain
But the nigga I am, farce, just fast with speed (Mark, bitch)
Respect the game, the lame niggas die slowly
Scam artists fly straight as Frank feared Scarface
From the Glock, the waste of lead
Dig your chest plate up
Thinking and running in my escape
Get on 2-10 and wait for you to retaliate
The terrorist making niggas whom we {Glock cocked}
Glock never get lost, through your grill here goes my fist
When I cut your wrist
With the styles of south central fuss
The outrageous anyone gets buckets uh (west side)
I'm doing niggas in the rap fight
Tear off your spine slowly, you go to pieces like a puzzle
I'm hand in muzzles to hit MC's
Niggas under siege, as Seagal fall
The booty, the chronic, plus the dives
The first shuddering black catches a bullet in my hip
In a rage, serving meter with my Glock to your grill
Let the garbage cans loose, now your brain is on the black roof
Killer mental state
I can't keep my nine straight
Drinking at this Hennessey
Waiting for the time to break
He appears and mothafuckas bows, acknowledges
West Side, Death Row, outlaws
Untouchable mafia of gun packers
Well known criminals tagged for the sale of ruthless jackers drugs
Forever buzzed
Roll with thugs and dawgs
Who wants to see me alone?
Catch Makaveli while sleeping
My mini-14 murdering niggas as they crawl, Uhhh!
Duck or stupid!
Drink until you pass out! (than)
I'm not fear to die
Driving drunk in my greenhouse
Niggas is under me
Bitches come to me
They heard the nigga stories
The pump first, my motto, is fully guaranteed
Niggas is playahatas
Name them my enemies and then pulling
Watch out young nigga!
Because it's time to tip
I am versatile, mothafuckas
What kind of rhyme do you want?
Niggas got me in sight
Now i'm running for my life
Tell me!
What is that, West Side?
I'm all about chasing paper because paper makes life so cool
Also, haste generates waste
And I have the whole place blocked, inventing styles
Catch me rolling everything top down (Nigga what?)
Realest with microphone
Most verbal disaster masher murders
Creator, 38 stasher
In the interior area where the Hellraiser roam
There is no place like home, TEC-9 and trading cards.
I have the heater sequence for the heat to disperse
In case the worst is worse, I turn over first
He who throws the last is the first to fall
My heart skips a beat at the feeling of heat
I'm defying death, bitches lying saying I'm not pretty
Now she wants an autograph (Hey, give me an autograph) Bitch, I'm not Snoop (What?)
A bone bitch ready to go bankrupt
Reaching your marks with my motherfucker 4
I'm hitting the hills so I feel like I'm ready for static
And niggas on my team it's automatic full meat
Planting all your hoes in your damn place
A bitch named Scarlo gets in your face
I'm dusting you off with slugs .44
So nigga, you wanna jump? You have to jump a little higher
Scarlo, nigga, miss messiah
So bitch, you better control the gang
You're fucking with the hillside, mentally crazy
Believing in my misery, I fucked her in yes
Giuseppe called me and told me
I have to do a mission on my butt, I have to go
Because you can run, hide (Hide)
But I'll catch you when I try to escape
You know my gat won't let you run, hide
You know my gat won't leave you
I'm flipping
Empty my gun
Because here the cops come
I'm going to crouch you down for blocks
Nigga I'm coming back
Empty my clip
Forever bustin '
East coast nigga running
Mothafucka, I'll be pulling
Assassin!
I carried things, nigga, it's time to throw
Sneakin 'on niggas who are sleeping when they fuck in the trunk
You slipped, then you dragged, now is the time for the trip
To the hills where niggas kill and peel your shit on the horizon
It's time to die, and no black can save g
Aiming for heads, pumping lead until I bury you
Niggas duck but I sway low like a car
Buck Buck, now tell your dead friends that I said, "What's wrong?"
Lullaby, rock-by-bye, nigga die
And rest in pieces, eternal pain of this fire
My 45 smoked and broke you
And nothing hurts like a cock with its liquid, in its eyes wide open
Gats smokin 'no jokin', Bullets to me
Soul removed from its core, as it lay, while I was pulling
Jay Z, come out to play
Hey, killer, give me one of those clues that I can ride on motherfuckers
Mobb Deep.
Niggas talking about we can't rap? Niggas must never have heard a motherfucker
Track a nigga from death row
Let's do it, in daylight or at dawn
CROWD
Come to hell or high tide, until you kill opponents
Just another soul lost, trapped, calling Jehovah
Outlaw until I'm done, brandish my leash, back like a cobra
I get drunk because I'm crazy when I'm sober
On a one-man mission, my ambition is to sustain
The rap game, while I make holes in niggas like donuts
And I still die for all my soldiers like hillbillies
They don't fear me, so we fight, bringing war to the city
With every breath death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me unapologetically your honor
A general at war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted assassins, quick to move, heavily armed
I am similar to Saddam, sometimes I wonder who is sane
Like frenzied demons for that last streak, caught in the game
I come on the scene like sandstorms, then I transform, look at me
While the bitches wonder who shot me
Loveless, hold a grudge, shooting slugs like Muammar Gaddafi
We take pictures of paparazzi, let's go and fly now, nigga, like Rocky
You have a lot of courage to play me, another gay rapper
While you guys are caught up in the rapture, even after me
I'm in Jamaica drinking daquiris, no doubt
We used to have nothing and then grab something and bustin
I wanted to be the black thug my old man wasn't
I can't tour, afraid to pick up cases, litigation
Niggas player-hatin ', cheated on me in all 50 states
We were raised on the driveway. bred to hit
As I build with this live place
Live it or surrender
And like DEMONS. late at night. hear them scream
With the money on hold, bail, come to murder, po hurries
Cap tilted to the side, when leaning out, bustin '
The outlaws enforce the secrets of war, but will not abuse it
Burned, bury my burners with my dead friends when I use it
Shit later. hot shots across the equator
The old ladies sing the blues. Let them smoke off their shoes
Now with every moment of my awakening
I'm on a quest to be better yeah
Position myself to prosper, prepared for anything
To go, out of that Novocaine, as in too difficult to live.
And I'm just a little beyond my teens. in adulthood
Now I finally travel with G, getting to know me well
EDI here take this black gun, it's over
I piss cold blood, shit hot liquor from my liver
Smoke like a tailpipe and write when I'm bitter
All my life I've been considered a downright dirty black
Since Dad hit Mom's pussy, the last drop of trash appeared
Tell me hit the hell of the world
But in hell I give you mo
Screamin 'fuck the Po' Po '
When I run to take that enough, of a simple fuck
To the billionaire luck
Also, I think it's time to grab all the guns, wave them in the air
Celebrate Outlaw living nigga, I wouldn't be here
For you death is losing, and for me this shit is a family reunion
My wallet. be as empty as the day I started
Twelve shots in my pocket, they let my niggas go
Too bad these niggas snake vultures are cold
In a dirty world where only God knows your death and can call it
We draw, necklines, Outlawz rush and royal flush
The first bomb kicking the dust. in Cali, but I'm not so much
Make them pay from state to state, from NJ to CA
The cowards felt the weight and became feminine like Michel'le
Niggas change their whole style when the outlaws come
A million miles and thuggin '
Young Noble, I keep them buzzing
While the abduction. Capture this damn style that I master
Bringing terminal disaster. I hit you when I pass nigga
I SAID YOU POINTS THAT I WAS AFTER BIGGIE WHO INVOLVED YOU, NOW WE GO OUT TO
WE, THE FIRST WE LOOKED FOR, WHO DO WE TRUST? OUT OF DEEP MOBB AND JAY Z, DEAD
The dust
I SAID YOU POINTS THAT IT WAS AFTER BIGGIE, YOU GOT INVOLVED, NOW WE GO OUT TO
SEARCHED ALL, ALL LEAVING
WE, THE FIRST WE LOOKED FOR, WHO DO WE TRUST? OUT OF DEEP MOBB AND JAY Z, DEAD
The dust
I TOLD YOU PUNKS THAT I WAS AFTER PIGGIE THAT YOU GET INVOLVED, NOW WE GO OUT TO
BUST IN ALL OF YOU, WEST, EVERYTHING HAPPENING
Jay Z (WESTSIDE), haha boy at the funeral, punk motherfucker
Big Cock Sucking Lips
How will you be Hawaiian Sophie one year and be a tough mob next year?
(Die, die slowly)
Nigga, my memory ain't bad for you in business
(Die, die slowly)
BANG, you are dead
(Die, die slowly)
(Die, die slowly)
BANG BANG, you're dead
(Die, die slowly)
Biggie, BANG, you're dead
(Die, die slowly)
(Die, die, die slowly)
You quit the game. There is no need to explain; out of here
Die, die, die slowly
Die, die, die slowly
MY LABEL: THE VICTORIOUS AND IMPACCABLE ROW OF DEATH!
Give it more volume
Hahahahahaha, hello man
You're a bit silly for love, right?
Word hahahahaha
Should have seen
You had problems from the beginning, you taught me many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this started, we were the perfect couple, maybe
We had some problems but we worked on it, and now
The arguments are getting loud, I want to stay
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned on being your man, it just wasn't me
But now I'm looking for compromise, in other weapons
I want to protect you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you have me stressed
As soon as I open the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be, you're killing me with your jealousy
Now my ambition is to be free
I can't breathe, because as soon as I leave, it's like a trap
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do it for love
Just when I thought I broke up and I feel happy
You try to catch me, say you're pregnant and guess who's the dad
To make you promises, trying to keep it
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holding on
Trying to be strong and in the process, keep you moving
To pack and leave notes, and get ghosts
To clear my head, I feel low, losing control
When we conspire to conceive, and now
That's all I need to hear because I'm leaving, I'm off the list
You'll never see me again, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheating, I'm sucking for love
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do it for love
Now it left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, waiting for the beatings to go away
It wasn't always a successful relationship
It used to be love, happiness and company
Remember when I treated you well
I took you to the hills, out of the evils of the ghetto chapel.
You and me a happy home, when it was on
I loved to call it mine
I should have seen you was a problem, but I was lost, caught in your eyes
Worried about being thrown, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry, we can do it now. I'm under pressure.
Make a decision because I'm waiting when I'm alone
I want to take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a suck for love
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, (do it for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Do it for love yeah baby yeah
Hahahahahaha, hello man
You're a bit silly for love, right?
Word hahahahaha
Piglet for love
I should have seen it was a problem from the start
Taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this started, we were the perfect couple, maybe
We had some problems but we worked on it, and now
The arguments are getting loud, I want to stay
But I can't help but go out, just throw it away
But now I'm looking for compromise on other weapons
I want to protect you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you have me stressed
As soon as I open the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be, you're killing me with your jealousy
Now my ambition is to be free
I hear you call me to come back, I'm a suck for love
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
(Piglet for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Just when I thought I broke up and I feel happy
You try to catch me, tell you that you're pregnant and guess who's the dad
I don't want to fall for it
But in this case, what could I do? So now i'm back
Trying to be strong and in the process, keep going
I'm about to lose my composure, I'm getting closer
To pack and leave notes, and get ghosts
To clear my head, I feel low, losing control
My heart is saying: go away, oh, what a tangle of cloth we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
That's all I need to hear because I'm leaving, I'm out of the game.
You'll never see me again, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheating, I'm sucking for love
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
(Piglet for love)
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
Now it left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, waiting for the beatings to go away
Remember when I treated you well
You and me, a happy home, when it was on
Worried about being thrown, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Make a decision because I'm waiting when I'm alone
I'm on the phone with secret conversations, huh?
I want to take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a suck for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
(I'm a fool for love)
You tried everything, but you don't give up
(I'm a fool for love)
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
(A fool for love)
What you won't do, do it for love
(A fool for love)
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do it for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do it for love

Hello snoop
(What happens?)
I put more punches than the gangster did
And Lucky Luciano about to sing soprano
And I know, I know how you feel
Just to catch you in awe
But when it is not, you can sit izzon bizzack
And let the Bizzow Wizzow ride the trizzack, ha ha
Unused suits, fifty dollar socks, one hundred thousand dollar shoes
Man I'm bluesing these MCs sucka
Yeah yeah let's go
Uh come on
Uh come on
Uh come on
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy Dogg Father (Father)
Uh come on
Uh come on
Let's make a move for this role (Where do we shoot Dogg?)
We have to be paid (making money, everything you want)
I mean I move on to the stage in my G-boy stance
And say some rhymes for your girl to want to dance
I'm so flying like a dove
I come from above
You're tripping over your girl because she showed me love
Nigga doesn't beat them, cause if he beats them, he doesn't need them
You put your hands on me, see how fast I take your freedom
I stay on em, and that's one to grow
You can rock to the beat you see
Or you can rock to the beat of me
Be sure to do your thang in a hang
And everything is everything
There's nothing more than this paper chase
You know I'm not trying to floss, but uh
The murder was the, the murder was the case that they lost
I'm Tha Dogg, Father
Come on, yes, come on, come on
Somebody say "hell yeah"
Hell yeah
Say "hell yeah"
Hell yeah
Come on come on yeah come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Now does anyone in the house remember
There were no rappers yelling about LBC
Am I tripping you? (Hell no!)
Now when I grow up I want to be like Snoop
Having prestigious women
That's the truth from the start
You say your family doesn't know me
Wait friend, that's for the majority and promotions
No one in my clique fails
But I'm going back to the grizzind
Snoop D-O double G returns for mizzine and
I'm tha doggdad
Snoop Doggy Dogg is Doggy ...
Big Lock!
What the fuck is wrong with you my friend!
The fact that not a day goes by that I
My album sold 5 million, so I love it like this
I'm making a record now called ONE NATION
It's a group album with me, Greg Nice, Buckshot
Smiff & Wesson, Outkast, The Outlaws, Scarface and E40
It will be out in late summer. What tapez
You need? I'll try 2 get new stuff
2 U when I can. Stay on the point, beach. Keep
Faith, shit gets better, don't even sweat
The Bitch Made Niggas Trying 2 Hate Beach
Doggz my true true Niggas "One Love"
Stay alive! I got that gardener job
Waiting for 4 U and profit R are reflected again
When you get here I am Let a nigga
Know what you need!
THE WORLD IS OURS
WESTSIDE IV LIFE
act as
Don't call me a bitch, punk niggas and all the counterfeiters
Weak muthafuckas are nothing more than enemies of the beach
Traitors, and all you did was hug me
Slow down, but everyone knows me now
So what you do is sit and think about a plot
This shit fell and warmed me
Niggas smiled like a bitch, while giving you accessories
I should have seen it as advice
Then I couldn't see the true mission
Because you smile on my face, and when I go straight
What my partner told me
"Yo Pac, look how you come back, everyone is not friends"
I should see you as a front and false
An envious snake ready to take my damn plate
I clench my fist and let it end like this
But it's dust for a nigga who betrays my trust
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me a bitch (call me a bitch)
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
You say you are a lady like
You wear your clothes so tight
That you excite the gloomy guy
And at night, girl, you're the type that gets weird
When I see you by day you are squeaky
Clean, what I mean is you can't be a demon for green
And expect to be treated like a queen
Because the brothers in the blocks don't have it
Now you screwed and that ass got screwed)
I came equipped with some shit to get you drunk
Because a bitch is a bitch
She will use any trick to catch me
And last year I used to be a saint
In 92 I am living without a heart
Niggas need to keep in mind they're domes
Because the time has come for them to find their own
Jock a nigga because he made a great movie
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
It's like a rope, I hung it up because I knew it was a drug
While others laughed and joked
I saw and took notes
Never give up, that was my motto while keeping myself strong
Or distinguishing, no one would listen, they were distinguishing
My record didn't sell, they said something was missing
Claiming that he was radical, because he was faithful to the streets
But were the streets faithful to me?
How the hell would I look if I changed?
Acting strange because I got a little bit of fame
Not a bitch, I was born in a beaten hut
There's no going back and now I'm making lots
And from the movie
Hoes wanna pop that coochie
Whenever it suits me
And I'm still the same
I have not changed my name
I still pledge allegiance to the game
Swear my life to the ghettos
Do whatever it takes to get paid one day
Refuse to lose, never smoke crack
A mack is a nigger with the biggest sack
As long as that is your hair, I'll take you there
But don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Dedicated to the scandalous hoes out there
Don't call me bitch
I'll see you at the clubs you know trying to sue a nigga
And for them punk muthafuckas out there (heh)
Don't call me bitch
But I call you Big Pac, nigga, you're playing me like one
Don't call me bitch
Yes, and for the muthafuckas who try to sell me, shit is on their mind, shit
Don't call me bitch
Yeah i told you not to call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Yeah don't call me bitch
This comes out for my teammates on the live team, do you see them all ?, Black Mafia
Ok you know what i say
5 niggas on this motherfucker, you know what I'm saying
Digital Underground, Ron Keys and all the fucking smell
Any of you know what I mean
Big john motherfuckin 'singleton in the house, ruthless records in motherfuckin's house
Look at a nigga on the big screen and you know what I mean
See how muthafuckas comes out of this song
But last year he was singing, Brendas got a baby this year, he says don't call me a bitch
Yeah call me bitch
Some of you niggas are bitches too
Some of you niggas are bitches too
Yeah don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Nigga, this is death row, Westside nigga fuck 'em all
Do not go to sleep
You can get your cash on nigga by looking
But don't fall asleep
Do not go to sleep
You can get your cash on nigga by looking
Other niggas close their eyes seeing dreams while sleeping
But don't fall asleep
West nigga
West Side
You know how we do it
California, the best in L.A.
Death row don't fall asleep black
Open eyes
Wide open
Contact focus, because I'm alive multiply
As soon as I open fire, blacks die with their eyes open
Dreaming of getting batteries, scratching the wrong way
What the song says, we murder motherfuckers every day
Blackout, turn off the track, my lyrics never fail me
Deliver the pump shit east to west
Like Yayo
Start exploiting motherfuckers copy me, it's fatal
The art of war living free of sucka, come with me
Nigga just don't sleep
Do not go to sleep
But don't fall asleep
Do not sleep
But don't fall asleep
Haha
Now in this life I am leading, I have tried to succeed but I fail
I'm thinking I should have listened when the teacher was teaching
Rebound
Through life with more knowledge, than a book can give me
But at school, I played the trick that probably
I should have taken it seriously
Now i'm in a position with a simple mission
Get some money in this rap game, a hustle to go Uh huh
Me and my children, down like we own the force
Fighting in war, shoulder to shoulder, Outlawz
Just until they catch us
Always running away from them times we were broke and
Three bucks for gas and before that, then we were walking
Haha but peep niggas walk down the street
Niggas knows the time, so we don't fall asleep
Come on
Do not sleep
Other niggas close their eyes seeing dreams while sleeping
Do not sleep
You can get your cash on nigga by looking (don't close your eyes)
Other niggas close their eyes seeing dreams while they sleep (Don't fall asleep)
But don't fall asleep
Sleep baby
Not sleeping physically, but I mean sleeping mentally
I mean, when niggas close, they watch the way the game goes
Microphone check, one two, one two, one two
I flip a double deck and stress you out
Complete this rap
And cut it from the neck to the rectum.
Jigga jersey another nigga from a drug stomach
Robbin 'cribs and robbin' niggas for bitches
Fuck phonetics, I chill down the school pumping 'notic's
The Madman, I'm trying to let you know about the badland
So now I'm in your city taking them to the caravan
So when I crawl I don't sleep
Or watch your floo catch a slow leak
Do not sleep
Other niggas close their eyes seeing dreams while sleeping
But don't fall asleep
Do not sleep
You can get your cash on nigga by looking
Other niggas close their eyes seeing dreams while sleeping
But don't fall asleep
Hahaha!!
Do not go to sleep
Outlawz nigga!
Outlawz!
Mutherfuckin 'M.O.B
Bullets to tricks
You know what time is nigga
Bad Boy Killa
There is no reader
Mobb deep killa
Hahaha
You all niggas die
In your damn dream
Go ahead close your eyes motherfucker
Close your eyes nigga
You sleep on the west side
Ahead
Go to sleep
Close your eyes
Rock a baby bye
At the top of the tree
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Don't fall asleep, nigga
Everybody dies...
Hands on my semi-automatic kill for pennies
Contact focus because I'm alive multiply
As soon as I open fire, niggas die with their eyes open
Dreaming of getting batteries, scratching the wrong way
What the song says, we murder motherfuckers every day
Black out the track explodes, my lyrics never fail me
It's like a throne that doesn't even own
He will not sit, he will give him a crown, he will only throw it
It is like a joke, it is like a king, but it does nothing.
He doesn't want diamonds, he wants gold or he wants jewelry
He doesn't want the room or he wants the loot that's in it for the sport.
Running circles around his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but is not begging for it
And you can love and you can hate it
But you can't ignore it, you can't be that ig-nor-ant
But you can try selling it short
And he was born to raise hell like them, the peasants.
And if I'm in front of the man, you'd better come confront me about it
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While the niggas flirt
I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
You want to see inside, uh, see you later
Here comes the drama, oh
That's that nigga with the fake, blaow!
Why are you hitting me in the face?
Stay in your place
Enter this black pocket
Do not go to sleep
You can get cash on nigga by looking
Other niggas close their eyes
Seeing dreams in them they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Do not go to sleep
You can get cash on nigga by looking
Other niggas close their eyes
Tryin blossom, he was knocked down walking, heh
Bleek a tall boy to hot, turned cold
Bring the body bag, look at the bullet hole and a burned soul
Don't cry, he chose life
Fast lane, in the brain, I was supposed to fight
How do you smile at a mom when she loses a child?
I inhale strong grass and then release stress
Deliver the pump shit east to west
Like yay-yo
Nigga retires when I say so
Start exploiting motherfuckers copy it fatal
I efficiently erase and then run away
The art of war, living suction free, take with me
Motherfucker don't sleep
You can get cash on nigga by looking
Other niggas close their eyes
But don't fall asleep
You can get cash on nigga by looking
Other niggas close their eyes
But don't fall asleep
Ahhh shit hahaha
My Hummer rolls up, evacuating tied soldiers
Internal strategy, manifesting military styles
Casual tragedy when niggas fight me
My prophesied prediction, change and move positions
My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world, me and the mafia to get married
It seems horrifying screams pierce the darkness
Just as suspected, a trick bitch where your heart is
The outlaws hold your head niggas anyway
Except some who want more from life than stress.
We're still hitting until no one is left
Do not sleep
Let's ride, keep my gun by my side
I always crawl with the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Do not sleep
Blowing pine, always rushing into the rut
Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Let's ride, keep my gun by my side
I always crawl with the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Do not sleep
Blowing pine, always rushing into the rut
Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Ingenious precision, they shouldn't speak, bad for me
A black man who committed murder, so sad to see
Another motherfucker floating on a plastic reef
Quick release, keep the police costing
East Oakland casualty clearance (doors open)
He drove into the hills, brought him to his knees, and blew his back off.
Death with the Lex Ruger, death for you
Blacks cry when bullets fly, kill them and execute them
First I explode until they give me body
Like my weapons in variety
Runnin 'wit' the real big fools that fools try to be
But in front
Doing my ride rolling a joint
Hands on my nuts in a stunt car
Poppin 'niggas like pimples nigga, nothing simple about mine
Etch-a-sketchin '
Dumpin 'on all of you punks at the intersections
Day after day, there are no easy exits for easy exits
Do not sleep
Let's ride, keep my gun by my side
I always crawl with the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Do not sleep
Blowing pine, always rushing into the rut
Let's ride, keep my gun by my side
I always crawl with the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Do not sleep
Blowing pine, always rushing into the rut
Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
G's up
A city
Blood, sweat and tears, when I break my rhyme
Yeah I- For my people like I carry my nine
And when I let go then there is no one left but mine
I don't give a damn lame nigga acting schiesty
He himself knew that he was in prison and did not write me
I want to fight with me, so come find me
You might see me with a battery in the trap (Yes)
I use my thoughts and my pen similar to a saran wrap
A little lame nigga I'll never be
Yes, I'll keep it, I'm one of the Three and Scrap will never sleep
Yes
Let's ride, keep my gun by my side
Do not sleep
Blowing pine, always rushing into the rut
Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Do not sleep
Let's ride, keep my gun by my side
I always crawl with the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Do not sleep
Blowing pine, always rushing into the rut
Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Do not sleep
Do not sleep
Do not sleep
This goes to C. Delores Tucker, Bob Dole
And everyone who feels like uh
They are stronger than the constitution
Freedom of speech big baby
Freedom of expression
Hahaha
Out of the law
Dammit! Rap music, I hate that
They are enemies of the police
Here going against society, I don't understand music
It's too loud. It is too loud, it is too loud, it is too violent.
(Outlawz)
Ban 2Pac, ban the Outlaw Immortalz, ban 'em
Listen, there's no stopping, I have to hurry
Take it, double it
Try to stop it and touch it
I'm a rooster and I break it
Niggas, fuck it, I'm trying to get him addicted to fast life
Get rich or die trying black, question 50
I've been operating under the laws of thugs as a warrior
Oppressed by the industry, the Hip-Hop government
Washed up by hip-hop police
All judges hold grudges
Giving my niggas life for a little almost nothing
So wherever you are, just a little something extra
You're not the only one, we're all going through the fight
Penny pinchin '
It's like you're not really living
Result on a 211, I'm cooking in the kitchen
As if we were looking and wishing
Praying, will you hear it?
It's eating my spirit
Speaking for the spirits
You can't break me, never make my heart beat
Miss Delores Tucker sued me, I won't stop
Until we get justice for these corrupt cops on my block
Time Warner full of ladybugs, tell everyone to miss me
A group of hypocrites who whistle at Dixie
Have a nice trip because you should never have touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't bear the pressure, I'm going to make you feel it
Trust me
Tryna sells 4 million copies
If I wasn't spitting it would be prison or death
So try to understand where we come from
Life as an outlaw is not for everyone
So here we go
Recognize how we organize ourselves.
And we can not stop
We can not stop
(Outlawz)
Until I reach the top
I don't know what you've been, I said
The real niggas don't stay, they go
I can't stop until I know you know
I won't stop until I get you to keep going
Bury me in a Makaveli suit and a MAC
If God hits me with lightning, I'm shooting at him
Skinny because I'm not going to exercise, my man is in the gym
As long as it's strong enough to put a hammer on your chin
Caught up in the storm, fuck the world until I'm gone
Until I'm gone
I imagine these bricks crouching down from the penitentiary
Watch
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams
Everything is wrong, pop disappeared a long time ago
And now 18 I'm stranded on my own
Protect my throne like a king, Al Capone style
Don't fake shots in this routine
Trapped with crack, I get mine
Living life as a Don, guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton
Yeah your boys come back with the right gear
When they think I'm wearing red, I'm a green rock
In an entire episode
The other side will hide in the block from the crime scene.
When it's hot in Nu, G-Ride from the clearing to the bricks
So gangster how he went from clearing to bricks
Blacks hate it but they're afraid of the fifth
(And we won't stop)
Outlawz!
In no way, how do we get to keep moving
And put it down
We can not stop
(Outlawz)
Until I reach the top
Through music we speak to the blocks
Strange as it may seem
I don't know what you've been, I said
I can't stop until I know you know
I won't stop until I get you to keep going
Because it seems that someone hid my nigga from me
Make a motherfucker become a Ki '
Son of a bitch, there's no one to stop me, my nigga
It's Mussolini, look at me all in the middle
I'm still getting cold like it's a bottle of Crys
So when you see me you can kiss me
He who poses with frozen wrists
Outlawed immortalized, we survive and curse
So I claim it like I'm hitting a lawn
Yes it's easy like I'm working
Call me squeeze and I'm ready to go dark
Outlaw, Nigga Makaveli ready to flow
Outlaw my niggas what they scream in the night
But Big Syko with the bully in your life
My nigga
Don't stop (don't stop)
Keep going (keep going)
Even when the wheels fall, we keep rolling (Keep rolling)
This Hip-Hop thing just won't stop
Here to stay as' Pac
Man I just can't let it go
It's in my bloodstream (Yes)
So when I flow I have to do the bully thing
Young Blacks Get Rich, Cash More Checks
Take life from the hood
Put it on wax
Bet now that we live the good life
New car and it shines so clean
I bought a house for mom, in sweet sixteen
From the block to the movie screen in the background and pimpin '
Recognize how we organize ourselves.
Create strategies now we unite brothers on the rise
And will not stop
In no way, how do we get to keep moving
And put it down
We can not stop
(Outlawz)
Until I reach the top
Through music we speak to the blocks
Strange as it may seem
I don't know what you've been, I said
The real niggas don't stay, they go
I can't stop until I know you know
I won't stop until I get you to keep going
Outlawz ...
Out of the law
Bob dole
And everyone who feels like uh
(Makes the kids go crazy)
They are stronger than the constitution
(Children kill people)
Freedom of speech big baby
(There are enemies of the police)
Freedom of expression
(They go against society I don't understand music, it's too loud)
Outlawz!
(It is too loud, it is too loud, it is too violent)
(Let's ban all rap music)
Out of the law
(Ban 2Pac, Ban Outlaw Immortalz Ban 'em)
You can't break me, you never did me, look for soft heartbeats
Miss Delores Tucker sued me, I won't stop
Time Warner full of ladybugs, tell everyone to miss me
A group of hypocrites who whistle at Dixie
You cowards knew you couldn't bear the pressure, I'm going to make you feel it
Trust me
Did I cry when they dropped me? (nah), can you stop me? (it will not)
Tryna sells 4 million copies (T.H.U.G)
This rap game all we have left
So try to understand where we come from
Life as an outlaw is not for everyone
So here we go
Recognize how we organize ourselves.
Create strategies now we unite brothers on the rise
Don't stop it (you're really not going to stop, hayy)
Do not stop
Stop the music (You really won't stop, haha)
Nooooo
Don't stop it (you're really not going to stop, hayy)
Do not stop
Stop the music (You really won't stop, haha)
Nooooo
Don't stop it (you're really not going to stop, hayy)
Nooooo
I fuck Knott's, so how much are you up to
In these young people, millions of them love everything we say.
Some of us are stumbling (huh)
But in turn, Busta slips
So get up, don't be an opponent
Because this is feeding my family, take it away
And look at me in every place where you plan to be
I have 58 ways to exit the game
But only one shape will fit my name; Hussein
Not even at the will of the police, I close the store
(You really are not going to stop, hayy)
Running fat blunt, niggas ain't rolling right
I complain about this song, I love rap (You really won't stop, haha)
Nonsense, unforgiving in every sentence, but on top of that
Brain Driller, fucking Fatal is a walking pain reliever
(You really are not going to stop, hayy)
Crazier than Caine, Uzi cops, then watch them fear
I'm ready to check a neck in a second
(You really won't stop, haha)
Grabbing the TEC and hitting you on the head because I break under pressure
Cutting circulation
Stranded on the ground, the land chasing
Burn like acid
Fart, blunt and jurassic, park
My ass bastard, we got the mashin 'strip
Don't stop it (you're really not going to stop, hayy)
Do not stop
Stop the music (You really won't stop, haha)
Nooooo
Don't stop it (you're really not going to stop, hayy)
Do not stop
Stop the music (You really won't stop, haha)
Nooooo
You're not really going to stop there
You really won't stop haha
You're not really going to stop there
Mhm !, I won't stop the music, I won't stop the music
Don't stop it (you're really not going to stop, hayy)
Nooooo
Don't stop it (you're really not going to stop, hayy)
Stop the music
I don't have time for this, man, I'm out
You should stop for a moment
You'll find me waiting (don't trust me)
Around here, next to your life (not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours running around
You have a little time
(not that I don't trust you)
As soon as I leave the house you want to call me
I see you got me trapped, I'm going crazy, this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous, give me room, it won't get better
Where have you been and who are you, I don't have room to breathe
It makes me want to go, I'm sick of these tricks up my sleeve
You suspect that I cheat, give me pain without believing
Ask me about my whereabouts, that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support, that's what you're here for
Not to give me stress and increase pressure.
Home is where I will rest, I will pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you alone
But I couldn't get home, so we argued on the phone
Do not trust me?
You'll find me waiting (don't trust me)
Around here, next to your life (not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours running around
You have a little time
Calling my house and then hanging up, do you think that makes sense?
Tell me what it takes to shake us off so we can be friends
We laugh a lot but the good became the past
Let's make an even break, don't make it outrageous
You're saying I'm too busy, I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said I cared about you
But now it seems that the arguments are nocturnal.
I want to hold you tight, but instead, you want to fight me
So why stop stressing and getting worse?
Instead, I'd rather break up, hope you don't hate me
You tell me you love me but you're lying
Fighting the urge to start crying
I love you as you love me, girl, but don't you trust me?
You should stop for a moment
You'll find me waiting (don't trust me)
Around here, next to your life (not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours running around
You have a little time
Have a little time for me?
(not that I don't trust you)
I hang up the phone, I can't bear to hear you yelling at me
Maybe we should finish it, none of us is happy
Coming over crying just to make me feel guilty
You and I were meant to be and still
You always want to sweat, how much closer can we get?
Don't worry, just let me pack my things and I'll be out
This time I'm dating, you let your mouth cram me
I have no space to sleep, I hope to see something because I'm leaving
Maybe next time you're a little bit more confident
But darling, until then I have to leave you
It is not that I don't need you, but that we see each other!
And I hope you understand why I'm bustin '
Not because we rush it
Do not trust me?
You should stop for a moment
You'll find me waiting (don't trust me)
Around here, next to your life (not that I don't trust you)
You have a little time
Have a little time for me?
Do not trust me?
It's not that I don't trust you
It's not that I don't trust you
Late night chilling with my friends
Drinking Hennessey and cold beer
After smoking, he stopped in Oakland
So we stopped to eat something
At the local barbecue
It's just another boring monday
And there is nothing more to do.
Now when we get out of the car
I heard someone fight behind me
Then I turn to look and discover
And the other was an asshole
And the junkie had an AK
He said he will spray and he is not kidding
Well he seems to be the fool
He owed man drugs for his product
And he swore if he didn't pay
I would end up being shot
Now i couldn't walk away
Wondering what would happen to this
Well my friend michael cooley
He said let's make our order
What is the use of looking at two men?
Highlights here fight for rooms
While walking inside the restaurant
And all the Dope Fiends greeted me
I heard the sound of various shots
All the people in the restaurant
I ran outside to see the big show
It was just another party
But for me I had concern
I wanted to go see the result
Would the mother have her child tonight?
Or would she live her life without one?
I hit the streets
Not only was the devil dead
But a little girl had been shot
That was daddy's bullet
But she took it instead.
I tried to push my way through the crowd
So I could go help the baby
She could hardly speak
Lord, can you save me?
Oh how I hated everyone there
The baby lies here dying
And I was wondering what I could do
Cameramen and newspapers had come.
For them it is just a story
It doesn't matter to them
I do not think I'll come back
Because it will never be the same here
So I wipe away my tears
Although some people say it's crazy
And the food could have been better
I will never forget, I will never forget the night
At Dopefiend's Diner
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do ...
After smoking, he stopped in Oakland
I have the snacks for some soul food
So we stopped to eat something
It's just another boring monday
Now when we get out of the car
I heard someone fight behind me
Then I turn to look and discover
What is the cause of this emotion?
A brother was a jerk
And the other was an asshole
And the junkie had an AK
Well he seems to be the fool
He owed man drugs for his product
And he swore if he didn't pay
I would end up being shot
Wondering what would happen to this
Well my friend michael cooley
He said let's make our order
What is the use of looking at two men?
Highlights here fight for rooms
While walking inside the restaurant
And all the Dope Fiends greeted me
I heard the sound of various shots
And I ran out to see ...
Another mermaid screams
Another mother cries
(What happens)
Because another innocent dies
(What's going on?)
All the people in the restaurant
It was just another party
So they see who they would know
But for me I had concern
I wanted to go see the result
Would the mother have her child tonight?
Or would she live her life without one?
I hit the streets
I almost cried on the spot
Not only was the devil dead
But a little girl had been shot
I felt a tear roll down my face
That was daddy's bullet
(What happens)
Another shot sounds
(What happens)
Another mermaid screams
(What happens)
Another mother cries
(What happens)
Because another innocent dies
(What's going on?)
So I could go help the baby
She could hardly speak
Lord, can you save me?
Then I screamed, someone help me
But I don't think they can hear
Oh how I hated everyone there
The baby lies here dying
And I was wondering what I could do
For them it is just a story
And they can't see the tragedy.
It doesn't matter to them
Because it is not, it was not his family
I do not think I'll come back
So I wipe away my tears
And leave the scene as I came here
And the food could have been better
I will never forget, I will never forget the night
(What happens)
Another shot sounds
(What happens)
Another mermaid screams
(What happens)
Another mother cries
(What happens)
(What's going on?)
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do ...
Respect for death row inmates
Death row inmates lawd dem never hesitate
To burst a shot, on a stupid face
Dis is Dogg Pound and your life is wasted
Dat Nigga Daz put you inna di cemetery
Now the D.P., if you feel bad about this shit, say "hell yeah"
Hitting a corner, hitting a switch, saying "hell yeah"
Fuck a hoe, fuck a bitch, say "hell yeah"
To all my G's that jargon, say "hell yeah"
To all my friends who hit, say "hell yeah"
No matter where the hell you hang up, say "hell yeah"
Yes check it out
Now here is the perfect mix to let it bubble and foam
It is the malicious genius and lyrical loose
And I pack the deuce-deuce of some juice right
I am in my own space and time
The elevation of my rhymes elevates your mind
For a DPG G to wear light blue and gray
I come, I came, I am, I am not
The nigga you wanna fuck, take off like paint
Down, nigga, give all you got
Bottom up or get hit, get shot
From this infectious enemy, they are loose (What)
My motherfucker from behind in the past
Now imagine yourself in a bottomless pit
No way are you climbing, and this is not punishment
Deadly as the glass crack, how should I react?
With intentions to keep going crazy, strap by strap
Is this my county-to-county limit?
Do your friends want to try to soak me like Bounty?
Dogg Poung Gangsta all day, all night
Partyin 'like a motherfucker all night now
But hey, simple as a fact, I've been waiting to serve your whole fucking crew
Slowly load your gun, get in, catch your homey straight glide
You should have known from the jump nigga that I was stumbling
Dogg Pound Gangsta gets to dive into the cut
My performance is huge, the way I kept on em
I catch them and let them know what's up with my opponents
I hold it for both of us and no one will shoot me
I will always reign, the first Dogg number one
My rhyme for some explanables and Doggs who can't train
I am a D.P.G.C. for life
I do what I feel and I do what I like (come on)
I am a D.P.G.C. for life
I do what I feel and I do what I like (sing it)
I do what I feel and I do what I like (fuck it)
I do what I feel and I do what I like
I hit it like gunshots, from the home strap
Give it a FUCK whatever your name is, I tell you fast
Out of my mind, something I wouldn't do without a nine
I have a pocket full of papers and a trunk full of rhythm
Smashing through the streets rolling with some heat
I'm hot, repeat it, day after day
Daily survival tactics in L.A
I'm on point and alert
Lurking, I get to work as a chemist
Mentally known to cause shitty dilemmas
It's a Dogg Pound Gangsta on the loose
Yeah it's your shit, say "hell yeah"
Dogg Pound gangsters say "hell yeah"
When I roll the length of your block, say "yes, yes"
To all my niggas the gang says "hell yeah"
If you looked outside and friends came
Would you ride (Amount) Would you mount (Amount)
Or would you think or by chance the circumstances of a brand?
And fuck you in the ass in the middle of a park?
Would you ride (Amount) Would you mount (Amount)
Don't doubt that Snoop

Who you are
Young nation, without revolution and without cause
A nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this
Killer mental state, I can't keep my 9 straight
Drinking this Hennessy, waiting for the moment to break
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw ridaz
Untouchable mafia of gun packers
Known criminals, tagged by ruthless jackets that sell drugs
Always buzz, roll with thugs and dogs
Start making rounds and then escape into the mist
My Mini-14 murdering niggas as they crawl
Niggas is under me, bitches come to me
They heard the stories, nigga, now they really wanna see
"Bomb first" my motto, it's fully guaranteed
Who you are
A nation under a bully and bullet scar
Young nation, without revolution and without cause
A nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just trying to get this
When it's on, I'm taking every opportunity I have
Out the window, some shit "Uptown Anthem"
I'm stressed but there's no pressure here I've been here before
Fugitive, task force at my girlfriend's door
Now check into your room, I'm not there
.40 cal, extended clips, still not afraid
Outlaw and you better believe they won't take me alive
I am different and I will prove it if it leads me to die
But he won't be lying in my coffin or making a living for me
I'm dying, do you think I'd let them see the joy of that shit?
Walking dead, angels spend the last days by my side
New Jersey Giant as Dave Tyree
Young George and Jonathan Jatt
Your pistols applaud, mine will go to brraaatt, soldier like Geronimo Pratt
And go through the black pound
When they raised the Twin Towers, Pac, I'm tearing them down
Children's poster: check it out!
Air Force Ones with alligator controls, I'm supposed to have wild sex
Money and murder is all I breathe in my life
It is full of judges and chasing enemies at night.
Through Henny I see the devil's eyes.
G ridin 'with extra bullet cases for 9 and shovel
Young nation, without revolution and without cause
A nation, young black and dangerous by far
I always thought I'd have to die to make a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a cemetery
You end up in a box ‘because they make them bastards
Dig your grave again, snatch your coffin
Worms in my eyes, eating my cabbage
Meat to bones, bones to ashes.
But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session
That's why I keep pressing them like an open wound
This given by God, he keeps giving me better music
So every time you listen to me my songs have improvements
You can't kill me, you're always losing, the songs are evolution
If I carry your gun for you when we hit it with other niggas, you better shoot him
Claiming you're ruthless
You got the same bullets you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it
Nacirema's dream prepares for execution
Papoose, Fatal and Pac: the revolution
Young nation, without revolution and without cause
I remember when you were LOST
and your soul was in the wind
But then your soul was found
and you discovered celibacy
But with this you forgot about me
And now I can feel it
the link we made before
I pray 2 God, stop
and never again
Young thugs in this motherfucker
Don't break the fight, let them rumble
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they don't see
Don't make enemies with me
Some say my criminal experience is legendary
I do what is necessary
Niggas wanna see me buried
I'm not going down, fuck the world, I'm a thug
Tell them nothing can stop me but a slug
I went from drug dealing to a caller
From outside the block, he no longer rocks
And putting money in my pocket, national baller
Bitch nigga, I'm ready to die, before I fry
I hit the grass so I'll always be high
My eyes have seen so much in misery, so before I run away
Bitches don't want to see me go, always hitting
And fuck the law 'cause raw niggas ain't free
This image is clear but we can't see, hahaha
This game is jealousy, don't let them change
That's what they keep telling me, fuck the fame
Loaded Mossberg wrapped in my sheets
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they don't see
Don't make enemies with me
You prefer to fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me, nigga
I try to tell these motherfuckers they don't see
Don't make enemies with me
Don't make enemies with me
The game is getting deeper with this, I couldn't stop, I'm remembering
And having flashbacks when those niggas lost
I wish in my heart these niggas don't have to start
Now therefore have to see in the dark
Played the role with the heart when we sparked, they parted
Foolishly running around the court, they really don't want to start
How do you want to do it ?, I K, anyway
So I stay, drinking my aray to keep my head up
And I'm where, everywhere from here until bedtime (yeah nigga)
And I squeeze when I say I'm coming
Shooting directly at enemies if it really is me they want
Because it's nothing, all of you niggas are up front
Do you really want it niggas dying ...
You prefer to fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they don't see
Don't make enemies with me
You prefer to fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me
Galitter tells them about that silly shit. Do you want to fight?
I want shit light, you lose your life, bitch (bee-yatch!)
A nigga fight too tough for what I got
I hustle and fold every fucking yard I copy and stop
Hell no! I couldn't see it
Waiting for a century in the Penitentiary but so be it
And Jesus couldn't help me in the state
Get ready for an early date to see my destiny at the pearly door
But wait, there's no time to stop, but death is calling
You want to step on it, someone has to start falling
It is true, what I do from the sun is to come
Wake up with my gun raised 'Cause when I sneak away it's when they run
Then it's time to spray like Ray
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they don't see
Don't make enemies with me
You prefer to fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me
You prefer to fuck with these other little G's
Don't make enemies with me
What a nigga, young thugs, let's do it
Don't make enemies with me nigga
You better fuck with these other niggas
Don't make enemies with me
Motherfuckers is a fatal nigger
I swear to the gods
Don't make enemies with me nigga
Niggas gonna see you attack with these bastards
Don't make enemies with me
It's for all those motherfuckers who swear to God
They are doing something
Don't make enemies with me
That they touch something
That they are something
You all niggas ain't shit
That's in my mom, bring the drama, nigga
These niggas are making records, you guys are the best niggas to check it
You all niggas, I don't give a shit who you run with
This is Thug Life nigga, the new generation motherfucker
Young thugs, we check in with all the high school motherfuckers
You better feel this shit, don't make enemies with these niggas
You better be a motherfucker, I swear to God
Do you think you will ever get to the point where you can live?
A normal and happy life?
And until then ... I have to make the life I live
As happy as I can and try to do my best with what I have
You know? Live the best life I can live
Be as happy as you can be ... nothing is perfect for anyone
I do not think
Thug for life, do you feel me? (So is)
I know sometimes it seems difficult, but ...
Remember one thing ...
For every dark night, there is a bright day after that
All my friends and my friends, stay strong
When things go wrong, especially the first and the fifteenth come
So no matter how difficult it is, stick your chest out, keep your head up ...
Wait..
I'll catch up with you in the next life
Oh, do this main Thug style, Thug style
When all this rhythm falls, we'll just run it to bet
I never had much, I ran with a lot
Little skinny boy hiding grass in my lunch bag
And throughout High School, we were just passing
And the driveby stole my friends from their young lives
I never cried, and although I had
Pain in my heart, I was desperate from the start
They couldn't tell me anything, everyone tried to help me
Marijuana was gone, it was not healthy
I traveled places, I discovered cases, what a bad year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
I never liked the police, that everyone knows
Now I have no peace, because they haunt me
And in front of me now, what do I do?
These things a thug goes through
And still I get up, so hold your head up high and make your mind strong
It's a fight every day but you have to hold on
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can spend the night, there is a brighter day
Everything will be fine if you hold on
It's a fight every day, you have to keep going
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can spend the night, there is a brighter day
It's a fight every day, you have to keep going
There is never a good day, because in my neighborhood they
And every Halloween, watch the crime scene
I can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
These are the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth.
I know it's not the truth, sometimes I look for evidence
I wonder if heaven has a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you're from blood or because
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects.
Little time drinking, taking drugs with them armies
Just another dumb boy from the sewer
I'm trying to tell you when it's on
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can spend the night, there is a brighter day
It's a fight every day, you have to keep going
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can spend the night, there is a brighter day
Everything will be fine if you hold on
It's a fight every day, you have to keep going
When it's on it's on but clean your eyes
In this world only the strong survive.
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
Well-being, AIDS, earthquakes, robberies, vehicle thefts
Yes, we have problems, but believe me when I tell you
Things always get better God doesn't like the ugly
And God doesn't like not to quit
You know what Billie Holiday said.
God bless the child who can hold on
You know you gotta stay strong
The game doesn't stop, mmm
If you never leave anything, learn one thing
Wait
Actually talk to the motherfuckers who persevered (hehehe)
I mean the first motherfuckers that came on the slave ships
(Hey, sorry, sorry) You know? (Look)
We come back for all you owe, you are no longer oppressed
Because now we overthrow those who put us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on the strategy and choose enemies correctly
Who is accused of my abuse?
Sorry, don't ignore what you think but you must leave the ship
Because once I break all your shit it sinks
Supreme ideology, you claim to uphold
Claiming that we are all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, the witnesses were silent.
Shattered, black claw style, thoughts I cast
It stays in your brain and then of course it grows
Maybe even your babies can produce and grow
Imagine a life where black babies can survive past five
Refusing to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Tie me up with words of destruction and I'll explode
But give me the will to survive and watch the world grow
Where is the restitution, stipulated in the constitution?
Hear the screams of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, the black seeds born in the ghetto still grow
We come back for all you owe
I'm going to pick up the shit that belongs to me
Motherfuckers are running and ducking
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission with a bad mind
Armed with grenade pistol missiles
Take out the pin, free, I'll come
How do you declare, Mr. Shakur, how do you declare yourself?
Yes sir, how do you file?
Shit, you know how I beg
Psssh
Not guilty of insanity, it was me or them
Bustin 'to my innocent family, they say they're looking for ki
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Where the hell is the search warrant?
No comment is what he uttered, before yelling "motherfucker Nigga"
Dropped me to my knees, I proceed to bleed
Suffering a rain of blows on my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watching?
I grab your gat and bust in self defense, my only option
Dammit!
Now they have me going to the county jail
And my family can't pay this scandalous bail
Try offering me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me and my people to a mansion in Brazil
Not to me, that's how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just got my Benz back
I told the judge it was in self-defense, he won't listen
So I'm hitting this in federal prison, giving everything I should
I'm going to pick up the shit that belongs to me
Motherfuckers are running and ducking
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission with a bad mind
Take out the pin, free, I'll come
I'm going to pick up the shit that belongs to me
Motherfuckers are running and ducking
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission with a bad mind
Armed with grenade pistol missiles
Take out the pin, free, I'll come
I couldn't help but notice your pain
Runs deep
Share it with me!
They'll never take me alive
I'm taking drugs with my four and five
Even as a young man causing a ruckus in the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kicking up dust
But now I'm labeled a problem maker, who can you blame?
Smoking weed helped me eliminate pain
I'm about to crash into the sidewalk, because my visions are blurred
That I have to do?
What else can I do?
But be a bully
Out slandering with friends
I've never been a stranger to murder
My city is full of gang bangers and drive-bys
Why do we die at a young age?
Was very young
But still a victim of 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse
Mind full of sick thoughts
And I will not go back to court
So fuck what you thought
Will I live to be 23 years old?
There is a lot of pain
Anywhere I go
I see the darkness
Covering skys
Anywhere I go
Anywhere I go
The problem seems to find me
Anywhere I go
What would you do if you couldn't make it to the NBA?
What would you do if you couldn't sing, like a Mary J?
What would you do if you couldn't hit a white ball like Tyga?
If you wanted to model, but weren't you skinny like Tyra?
What if you wanted to be Eminem?
You can be Eminem, and I have proof
Or you could be Obama and bring troops
Or you could be Osama and rip roofs off
Or be Corporate America and reject all young people
Or be the only one, inside my shoe
So you can see where I walk, you can see where I've been
Watch my father rape my sister when she was only ten years old
9, 8, 7, 6, NASA takes me, life is a bitch
Anywhere I go
The problem seems to find me
Blood in my eyes
Anywhere I go
They got me mobbin 'like it was
Load my clip and put on my damn gloves
Motherfuckers bust with paaassion
I'm crazy, I drink Hennessey and I get high
In search of my enemies
I don't want to die
Tell me why this stress is becoming important
A fifty dollar in the face with my razor
What can I do but be a bully until I die and go?
These crazy bastards
He wants to kill me while I sleep, but can they see him?
And every day is just a fight
Don't let them worry you
Keep swinging on these suckas until they bury you
I was born to raise hell
A gut black
Word to mutha, I'm tough
I'm kicking the dust
Ready to burst
I'm on the filthy bad scene
Until they kill me
I will be living this life
I know you feel me
There is a lot of pain
Davey D: His mother, Afeni Shakur, was a member of the Black Panther Party. She was pregnant with Tupac while in prison and on trial as one of New York's infamous 21. This was a time when all party members were charged with conspiracy to bomb public places. Afeni Shakur was finally cleared of all charges. Tupac's aunt Assata Shakur was also a member of the Black Panther Party. She was accused of killing a New Jersey state soldier. Finally he fled the country in exile. Today she still lives in Cuba. Tupac described her mother as a woman of strong character who ran her business. Her real father was unknown. When he was young, he identified with a pimp and little scammer named "Legs" who later died of a crack-induced heart attack. Tupac was described as an energetic boy who always liked to imagine himself in the lead role. His mother saw fit to enroll him at age 12 at the 127 Street Ensemble, which was a theater group in Harlem, New York. Tupac's first acting role was the character, Travis, in the play Raisin in the Sun. Tupac did not get involved with rap until he and his family moved to Baltimore. When he was a young teenager, he took the name "MC New York". While living in Baltimore, Tupac continued to audition and later be accepted into the prestigious Baltimore School of the Arts. At 17, Tupac moved with his mother to Marin City in the San Francisco Bay Area. It was in Marin City where Tupac lived on street life. In an attempt to be accepted and fit in with his peers, Tupac became a small scam artist who sold drugs. It was in Marin City where Tupac rediscovered rap. He congratulated himself on the emerging Bay Area rap scene by joining a group called Strictly Dope. This group featured Bay Area rap star Ray Luv. While a member of Strictly Dope, Tupac decided to diversify and eventually befriended Digital Underground's main rapper Shock G. Tupac auditioned for the group and eventually became part of the group first as a roadie and then as a dancer. He then went on to be an exaggerated man for the Digital Underground group. As a member of Digital Underground, Tupac became known as "the rebel of the underground". Much of this had to do with his excitable and unpredictable personality. Tupac's tendency to stir things up had led to many of his successes, as well as many of his problems.
(Problems, problems, problems, problems ...)

The one who writes for Billboard Charts
Okay, now let's take a look, what do we have now?
For the second aspect, thieves are going to lean on now
All of these mean muggin brothers from the streets
They have become loving rhythms of the 'Rubbin' club
And even if so, better pretend I don't know
There are no funky steps here, so don't even ask me
That is why the dancers on the payroll are paid
But there are no dancers in the studio when the record is made
It's just me and Big D going 'buckwild, on top of the pile
So come, come and do it if you feel bad
Lie down and bend over but sleep and I'll draw letters from you
2 Pacalypse is rocking it for the public
So what do you want to do now? You and your crew are done
I think the ice is melting, because the brothers are coming true now
Hip-hop is here to stay, fade away
The one who writes for Billboard Charts
But it doesn't kick any material from inside the heart
Fade away, fade away
Hooked like a thief, I reached out and grabbed your microphone
And when there is not a single instrument playing
And there's no one praying, I can't hear a word you say
I heard you sold a million records in a million states
And the tipper Gore doesn't impress me
She is a threat in a quest to undress me
Sometimes I joke, I don't put on the vest, so don't test me
This is not a bus, so don't rush or arrest me
Making money and destroying angels is a beautiful world in which we live
Looking at the Grammy nominations, smiling on my face and
Hoping to take my place to the beat of a corporation
This is just a sample of the aggravating, the frustration
Have faith in your occupation
The cops think I'm selling a toilet, I'm selling tapes and
Tryna takes my career to the best place and
Peace to the brothers who paved the way
Rolling in his grave today as they fade away
The one who writes for Billboard Charts
But it doesn't kick any material from inside the heart
Fade away, fade away
The one who writes for Billboard Charts
But it doesn't kick any material from inside the heart
Fade away, fade away
Fade off
Fade off
Far from an AK
Never fade
Never fade
Never fade, never fade, never never fade
But it doesn't kick any material from inside the heart
So they fade away, fade away
There were 2 people with a wish
2 GOD would pray that they would stay together
under the stars above
But someone else made a wish.
at the same time in the same breath
And although wish 4 love was granted
So was this wicked wish 4 Death
Now i make a wish
sealed with tears and laughter
It is my wish that these 2 loves
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You really are cute
You know I'm not trying to be silly
And be rude, they call me Kastro
And you; Oh! The storm sounds like a cutie too
What is poppin '? with me and you
Just hit me with all seven
It will be a pleasure to see what we can do
Oh! you are not alone, you have a man at home, answer the phone
What are you drinking at? - Hennessy with me
A glass of Thug Passion or just a simple Pepsi
Oh! You're great? - I'm sure I assume
Today you don't drink too much
You were fine i think i love you right away
Look, I'm only eighteen, these groupies just want to sue me
Push my whoopty, act like they don't waste my dooky
And I could see what it would be
I put you in my video and I give you a lot of mass
For my hotel room, four fifty-four, I hope you go
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
Look girl, I'm tied up with the game but it's not similar
The shit I'm talking about gets deeper
What to call and come to visit you, it's hard to feel
But I've been playing since I was born
I can't ignore the way you hit the stick and play on the floor
Hitting every position and that's for sure
But I think it's more than a situation that I'm facing
Your Shorty doubted, so I'm going to replace her
In addition to being specific; there is no hoochie that is not listed
That the friends I roll with are not twisted
And that makes me despise him
For dropping the highest level of the game and having no digits
Now can you dig it? - but you are not in competition
Now baby can you fade me away
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
Oh! Mo, you are a little player Napoleon but uhh
(Let me show all of you little niggas how it's really going)
I'll show you how big dogs do it, nigga
This is how you lift it
You don't know how to rule without bitch nigga
(Wait baby! Would you go, thinking you might fade me away?)
Go aside, which one?
Choose everything, choose nigga, which one?
That? - look at this shit
Wait baby, would you go, thinking you might fade me?
Oh! Yes you're crazy thinking you can be swazy
Participation needed, yes I'm drunk and I'm getting discouraged
In the back of my Jaguar, the life of a rap star
Completely strange
I get weak when I sit down and think about things we can do
Let me introduce Mr. Makaveli: who are you talking to?
What's up with you? - As you can see, I love to drive you crazy (Boo)
Who, black, Mexican, Puerto Rican too
As long as it's a ghetto, you can bet I'm getting into you
Believe it boo, I have my eyes focused on the size of your thighs
No, I'm not Dre baby, but won't you let me ride?
Because a nigga wants the putty cat
And that's a fact, so how do you want to act?
Baby can you feel me - as Run D.M.C. "It is so"
Tell me can you fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me
This is how you make a whore, little young niggas
Come on baby, let's go to my little hotel and shit
Ha ha, to see if you can fade me, do you feel me?
Hey, don't trip over the 'B' word
This is how motherfuckers talk on my block
Ha ha, what happens though boo? where you want to go?
No we can go get some drama and shit
Don P., Crystal, Fat Steak, Lobster, and Shit
Back to tv
Hit some of that immortal outlaw Dramacydal shit
That's the kind of shit that gets me in the mood, you know what I mean?
Ha ha, come tell you now and uhh
Nigga, this beat is bad for a motherfucker
You know, there is no disrespect, great player
But a motherfucker loves this beat so much
We are sending you this
OUTLAW!! WEST SIDE!! DEATH ROW!! THUG LIFE!!
OUTLAW!! WEST SIDE!! DEATH ROW!! THUG LIFE!!
OUTLAW!! WEST SIDE!! DEATH ROW!! THUG LIFE!!
Baby can you fade me away
WEST SIDE!! THUG LIFE!! WEST SIDE!! THUG LIFE!!
WEST SIDE!! THUG LIFE!! OUTLAW!!
This is a Jazze Phizzile production (Jazze Pha, Jazze Pha)
My sizzle! (My sizzle) Ha!
Outlawz! (Outlawz) 2Pac, Makaveli!
Still breathing, yeah, woo - wooo-WHEEE!
Fantasies of yours in submission, strange positions
Pushing, pulling and spinning I'm on a mission, I got into the mash
I tried to dig, you were screaming when I did
Constant yelling for me to hit and "shit"
As soon as I saw her she saw us playing hiding the weiner
I want to "Freak Like Me", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side by side
Make you scream my name when a nigga thug rides, "Can I cum inside?"
Say you don't feel that that's a lie
You're only afraid of having this prison dick
The jog caught your attention when I passed
I said hello"
But you were so shy, I can't lie, I almost stuttered when you passed
First you put your heart into me, and that's not a fair exchange
And if it's worth it baby I'll return the favor
A fair exchange, in everything
And let me tell you that it must be so
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it to me (give it to me) give it to me
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang
Open your legs
You got me marching like I'm a million, you tremble from the feeling
Look up because I have mirrors on the ceiling
And just for fun, I bet I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes let me warm it up
Because when we fuck I refuse to pop a walnut until I hit it
Drop the top, it's time to fuck while the wind blows
Remember on the balcony lean over the baby bounces off me
And let me hit it where it counts and run away
Although I like how you work it
You don't deserve it because you walk around acting like you're perfect
It took a while, but I finally got it, and as a chief player
Bitch, you're not doing me favors, fair trade
You make me
And if it's worth it baby I'll return the favor
And I give it back to you (I give it to you, I give it to you)
A fair exchange, in everything
And let me tell you that it must be so
Give it to me (give it to me, give it to me)
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang
Now your attitude is not realistic
And since you're tied up with penetration
It is correct to show a form of appreciation
Instead of pretending like you can't hear the bed shaking
In the naked bed, so twisted, think that your legs break
You said "take it" so I'm blind to my passion, how long will it last?
Constant doggy style pumping in that ass, until I explode
And then I laugh as we lie down
Look, I wait until you fall asleep and that's revenge
I made you drowning your screams in the sheets, fucking me
A true digger that triggers love, a black thug
Hustlin bitches as drug dealers
Before saying goodbye, end all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange
You make me
And if it's worth it baby I'll return the favor
And I give it back to you (I give it to you, I give it to you)
A fair exchange, in everything
And let me tell you that it must be so
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it to me (give it to me, give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn
You make me
And if it's worth it baby I'll return the favor
A fair exchange, in everything
And let me tell you that it must be so
Give it to me (give it to me, give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang
Do you want me to do what?
What is it?
The fair exchange, the fair exchange is not a robbery (I do, you make me hahaha)
The fair exchange, the fair exchange is not theft (everything is legal, baby, everything is legal)
An image of perfection
The object of a black affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of yours in submission, strange positions
Steadily screaming points for me to hit, and "shit"
As soon as I saw her she saw us playing hiding the weiner
Up and down is the object, side by side
Make you scream my name when a nigga thug rides, "Can I cum inside?"
Say you don't feel it, it's a lie
You're only afraid of having this prison dick
The jog caught your attention when I passed, I said "Hello"
But you were so shy, I can't lie, I almost stuttered when you passed
You want me to lick it, and worse still
Your heart is set on my going first, and that's not a fair exchange!
Fair exchange
No theft (hahaha, yeah nigga)
Fair exchange
Open your legs
You got me marching like I'm a million, you tremble from the feeling
Look up because I have mirrors on the ceiling
Close your eyes let me warm it up
Drop the top, it's time to fuck while the wind blows
Baby throw your legs out the window
Do you remember on the balcony? Lean baby, bounce off me
Remember me? "I move" and my "temptations" chase me
Sexual participation, my motivation
Although I like how you work it
You don't deserve it because you walk around acting like you're perfect
It took a while, but I finally got it, and as a chief player
Fair exchange
Fair exchange
Now your attitude is not realistic
Yeah it's true I'm putting my pussy on but baby you're putting your dick on
And how are you being tied with penetration
It is correct to show a form of appreciation
Instead of pretending like you can't hear the bed shaking
Constant doggy style pumping in that ass, until I explode
And then I laugh as we lie down
Look, I wait until you fall asleep and that's revenge
Because you're acting like you did something, giving me a piece
I made you drowning your screams in the sheets, fucking me
A true digger that triggers love, a black thug
Hustlin bitches as drug dealers
Before saying goodbye, end all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange
Fair exchange, fair exchange, no theft (no theft)
(if I make you and you make me)
Fair exchange, fair exchange is not a robbery (it is not a robbery)
No theft (no theft)
Fair exchange, fair exchange no theft (no theft) no theft (no theft)
(if I make you and you make me)
Fair exchange, fair exchange is not a robbery (it is not a robbery) it is not a robbery (it is not a robbery)

Fair exchange, fair exchange (not a robbery) is not a robbery, stealing is not a robbery, yes!
Fair exchange, fair exchange, no theft (no theft) no theft (no theft)
(if I make you and you make me)
Fair exchange, fair exchange, there is no robbery, (it is not a robbery), there is no robbery (it is not a robbery)
(if I make you and you make me)
Fair exchange, fair exchange, no theft, (not a robbery), (not a robbery)
Fair exchange, fair exchange, there is no robbery, (it is not a robbery), there is no robbery- (it is not a robbery) robbery!
(if I make you and you make me)
Fair exchange, fair exchange, no theft, (not a robbery), (not a robbery) (hey, check this out)
(if I make you and you make me)
Picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Pushing, pulling and spinning I'm on a mission, I got into the mash
Constant yelling for me to hit and "shit"
I want to "Freak Like Me", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side by side
Make you scream my name when a nigga thug rides, "Can I cum inside?"
Say you don't feel that that's a lie
You're only afraid of having this prison dick
But you were so shy, I can't lie, I almost stuttered when you passed
You want me to lick it and even worse
Just one thing you can do for me
Nothing but our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make it scream your name
You can do what you want, I got what I want and I left
Nothing but our fair exchange
Open your legs
You got me marching like I'm a million, you tremble from the feeling
Look up because I have mirrors on the ceiling
And if you want, then we can travel until the sun shines
And just for fun, I bet I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes let me warm it up
Because when we fuck I refuse to pop a walnut until I hit it
Drop the top, it's time to fuck while the wind blows
Baby throw your legs out the window
Remember on the balcony lean over the baby bounces off me
And let me hit it where it counts and run away
Remember me? "I move" and my "temptations" chase me
Sexual participation, my motivation
Although I like how you work it
You don't deserve it because you walk around acting like you're perfect
It took a while, but I finally got it, and as a chief player
Bitch, you're not doing me favors
Fair exchange
Just one thing you can do for me
Baby you can treat me well we can do it all night
Nothing but our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make it scream your name
Nothing but our fair exchange
Now your attitude is not realistic
Yes, it's true, I'm putting my pussy on, but baby, you're putting your cock on!
Instead of pretending like you can't hear the bed shaking
In the naked bed, so twisted, think that your legs break
You said take it so I'm blind to my passion, how long will it last?
Constant doggy style pumping in that ass, until I explode
And then I laugh as we lie down
Because you act like you do something, give me a piece
I made you drowning your screams in the sheets, fucking me
Hustlin bitches as drug dealers
Before saying goodbye, end all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange
(It's just one !!!) Just one thing you can do (thing you can do for me), for me
Nothing but our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make me scream your name (make me scream baby)
You can get what you want, I got what I want and I left
Nothing but our fair exchange
Just one thing that you (whatever you want) can do for me
Baby can you treat me well (can you make me?), We can do it all night
Nothing but our fair exchange
Hit my G-spot and make it scream your name
You can get what you want, I got what I want and I left
Nothing but our fair exchange
Fair exchange
No one give me love (love)
Like you (nobody loves me like you)
No one gives me love
Like you (I know that, you know it, you love it, I love it)

Go up, go up, go up, what
Go up, go up, go up, what (yeah)
Go up, go up, go up, what (yeah, what, yeah, uh)
Pack your cannons, we brandish weapons extravagantly
Know Jamaican like you god {U-god?} And he's giving them lessons
And talk about the conditions of blacks
That is illegal, they enforce it with the force that is lethal
Go to Congress exercising your constitutional right to bear arms
Leather jackets and glasses and you can say it's us
The FBI will probably go crazy if we destroy ourselves
Call him militant but no one kills Barry {Goldwater}
You can't be a militant if you don't have an army
Imagine some niggas with guns, I got them so upset, word
Nowadays you could be shot for a cheap necklace
Back then my people searched for free breakfast shots
Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
Could you learn from the stars that fall from the sky
Everyone acts hard, like they have no consideration
So we cry shooting stars, they still live so hard
(We are still here, word)
This is for Medgar Evers, Martin and my brother Malcom
Sometimes we sit down and wish for another result
My head is spinning, it will be full of why and how is it that
The value of life is so cheap if your skin is not talc
It's all about the cash, so we respect the biggest winners
Don't confuse me with enemies, player
Get your role, just show respect to the people who did it (yeah)
Blessed by the creator, so give him black money
Just don't bring a plate of food around a hungry nigger
On these streets the police are killing
I'm pouring out my heart in these beats so I can feed my kids (yeah)
Cause we don't need no more falling stars
Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
Everyone acts hard, like they have no consideration
So we cry shooting stars, they still live so hard (We're still here)
Hands off Asada and the blood from a dance floor
Word, rock, launch the 2Pac
Shine brighter than those Las Vegas lights
Lighting up that night from Las Vegas to the party after the fight
until the shots disturb the peace like Luda
Too bad I'm not a white girl in Aruba
They would have an entire department dedicated to finding the killer
Word, Bill O'Reilly would be flapping his gums
How much respect do you have for my people?
Actually none
Or you do the nigga packing a gun that hates niggas
Although every time a mirror passes by you stare at one
My man highlighted the cause of the lack of funds
This is the kind of shit that makes you want to drown your liver
And blacken your lungs
Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
Could you learn from the stars that fall from the sky
Everyone acts hard, like they have no consideration
Now before you see God, or stand before Allah
Could you learn from the stars that fall from the sky
Everyone acts hard, like they have no consideration
So we cry shooting stars, they still live so hard (We're still here)
Eazy-E, still here (still here)
My fair man (still here)
Big L (still here)
Big Pun (still here)
I'm from brooklyn you know what i'm saying
Brooklyn knows a lot about tragedy
That was our whole world, I (still here)
This is for our fallen stars
Inspired by poets, revolutionaries, and activists.
From the generation before us
Come and do our thing in this microphone
Can a black man put on the microphone?
And say whatever you want to say?
It's a lot of responsibility
But we are standing on the shoulders of our ancestors.
So I bear that load, I throw it on my back
They could never understand
what you set out to do 2
instead they chose 2
ridicule
when you got weak
They loved the view
of your attenuation
How could they understand what was so complex?
they wanted 2 c your dead body
In this way you could not alter the course
of ignorance that they have established
2 make my people forget
what they have done for a long time 2
2 just forget and carry on
I had loved you forever for who you are R
And now I cry our fallen star
We want fame!
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain, caught in this game
Seeking fortune and fame
The only thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
It was nothing but pain, caught up in this game
Seeking fortune and fame
Although we exist to reproduce, some believe that the currency reaches the G
Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
They made me hot when they shot me, plotted my revenge
To increase my ends, the enemies fall
Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay faithful
Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
And for fame, niggas change fast, it's a shame
What to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?
A little crazy, I hope we can change over time
I know, death follows me, but first I will kill him.
Is there a cure for a scammer with a death wish?
Cigar ashes, glass toast, glasses
We crushed each other on those jealous bastards, with my balaclava
I'm the first to want it ruined
Wrapped in plastic, the shit hit his ass
There's nothing left now, treated like a stepson was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches will be rock rhythms, fake in fame
Block run and shoot slugs
We throw them back like hard balls
Without the gloves, there is no love for these desperate false
And thugs bleed to envy
They smoke and turn off, Roman, drinking Henny
Drunk nights and hot days
Raising my heat, shooting it sideways
A life on the run, full of common blunts
Fulfilling my destiny on my knees and one's wishes
I'll be pulling all my cabbage like priors, caught in the trance
Looking for something higher, fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Something we all adore
Something worth dying for
Seeking fortune and fame
Seeking fortune and fame, lost in the rain
A loss of the game, with life is the cost of the game.
We're forcing change, motherfucker wearing a chain
All the blame belongs to the part of the brain.
That we never use, nigga, plus my heart is aching
And if I ever lose, buddy, I bet I'm on it again
Outlaws don't die, so close we stay
And if the family comes before, all the fortune and fame
As I walk to the crib I rested my head
Say salaam to the angels, I hope they bless my bed
I hope you bless me on the right track
I have a friend locked out of town, today I sent him a kite
Man, that hate in your heart you have to clean it up, dawg
Praying for my fall, and I can feel it, dawg
They gave me the fame of the street
Like Glocks timed and keep on target
And I ran with the local street gang
They say the light fades but still glows in the dark
And that's a game that I got from the game generation
On the path of life, dog
We need to change lanes, think about it!
One thing we all adore
Nothing but pain
Trapped in this game
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Being nothing but pain
Seeking fortune and fame
I can't complain, I've seen my fair share of fame
It won't change me, now I have this change
I feel strange, I got so used to the hood
That when I finally came out at first I don't feel well
I was just a baby, still delayed by slavery
When we fought to shovel shit, no one saved me
The ghetto didn't make me, I made myself
Poverty raised me, thinking there is no help
I pray for my health, my mind and my family too
State of myself, my routine and my family team
Where one hand washes the other
No, we are not blood, but we are still true brothers.
The fight is real, nothing can steal what we build
And that's real, the life that was meant to be
Love for my family tree, that's fame for me, how are you?
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Trapped in this game
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain
Trapped in this game
Seeking fortune and fame
Because we all sprout from different trees
It blooms in the dark and gives birth to promising pods.
I was that tree that grew out of the undergrowth and was not meant to be
I'm not ashamed, I'm actually proud of my blossoming family tree
Although I ... fight in my life, I never give up
And you ... you know I'll always be by your side
My family tree ... yes, a family tree
Yes, my family tree ... my family tree
I find greatness in the tree that grows against all odds
You'll never see me give up
I'll keep going ... never hold my head alone
Never no ... my family tree ... my family tree, yes
My family tree ... family tree ...
Because we all sprout from different trees
Or in the vast forest where you breathe?
The tree must fight to breathe.
I'm not ashamed, I'm actually proud of my blossoming family tree
Haha, aight
Storm, motherfuckers
I really don't know if you can flow or not
So do this shit like last time
Scream my name, nigga, you're gonna scream
You must be a bully with a heart to be part of my team.
It seems we have a problem
We are not letting any woman and the feminine side
Now who's the craziest?
I agree, it's a man's world, but why should niggas dissuade us?
I'm not trying to hear it, witness my thug spirit
Because blacks love to hear it
I called my kids because they are loud and then a motherfucker
I love you niggas like brothers, but don't fuck with me
So all of you niggas be warned
From dusk till dawn
Out of the law
I said it and I meant it
And when you see me live on television
Now let me hear you scream
This is for my niggas
Just for my niggas
For my niggas
Let me see you raise your hands
This is for my sisters
Just for my sistas
For my sistas
Let me see you raise your hands
Verse 2
Now when I say pig
You say B-I-G
When I say Bad Boy Killer
Then you tell me
When I say that Puffy is a punk, you scream a word about my life
I wrote this shit while Big's fucking wife
Now I've been told that Lil Kim thinks she's hot
She does not
Also now the journey of Da Brat is going crazy
Must want a whipping ass
We are the first to fuck with you and Bad Boy, weak bitch
Crossing Brooklyn, licking my shots to Queens
Because I'm looking for Little Shawn, that damn devil
I made him scream like last year
The best thing is that you don't come to California, we don't want your butt here
We ban ryders thugs until we die
Niggas getting high
Call me a damn troublemaker
Send me to jail
But watch me burst in LL
This is for riders
Only for riders
For riders
This is for riders
This is for bitches
Just for the bitches
For the bitches
Let me see you raise your hands
This is for them you look
Just for them you look
You look for them
Let me see you raise your hands
This is for my niggas
Just for my sistas
For my riders
Let me see you raise your hands
Look at it, did you?
We get out of here
2pac and storm
Outlaw Immortalz
Death row, west side
THUG LIFE, beyatch ...
Because we all jump
we are not created equally
or in the vast forest where you breathe
the tree must fight 2 races
among the evils of weeds
I find greatness in the tree
that grows through thick and thin
blooms in the dark
and gives birth to 2 promising pods.
I was the tree that grew from weeds.
and it wasn't meant to be 2
embarrassed I'm not in fact I'm proud
from my blossoming family tree
I Ryan man (me what's up cuz)
I just ordered locked girls (what's up)
I'm trying to talk to her but we didn't even explain what happened (honest man)
It was funk, she was fine (she was fine) (she was talking about friend, what do you think)
She was fine, some of us yelled for the magazine (just shit)
(I want to know what happens with that)
Look at this man (what's up)
Trapped like a prisoner, fantasize about kissing her
I treat you like a queen, but other boys are losing you
I wonder if you know how much I think of you
If I can throw water on you, then I sink into you
It's for eternity, these feelings are burning me
It's like a fire, this desire longs to be pulling me
Closer, until your chest is close to mine
But I don't want to rush you, so I'm still waiting
What if we were lovers, what night would it be?
Because we are attacking undercover like the wild beast
Then wake up and realize it wasn't real
It was just my heart, playing tricks on me
Because just thinking of you baby makes me love you more
These feelings drive me crazy but I can't ignore
What you mean to me, you are a dream to me.
No matter how realistic it seems to be
I have to control myself, because I'm dissipating
I wake up, I realize that I'm kissing
And I hope someone in this world is who it meant to me
But if I find her, will I have the nerve to speak?
Or will it override my ego causing my heart to become greed?
I have to, I have to tell him how I feel.
Now my heart beats fast, sweats feat on my thumb
I have to fix myself because here she comes
I said hi, she was flying, get lost in her eyes
I tried to speak another word but my tongue was tied
Every time I try to speak I stutter again
I feel like I'm ready to cry, ashamed of my mind
She smiles and gives me her number and says to call her sometime
And I realized, I never knew his name
So when I turned around I felt my heart break
She was gone, just like the number she wrote
It was a fantasy
Nothing but a fantasy
I fell in love with a fantasy
Straight man (word man I feel you)
Oh cuh (well, do it your way, man)
But look at this, man, I just came from the cradle, oh man
She is [?] I can't believe this man (what's wrong?)
Let me tell you that [?] It's saying
(break it down to do, what happens)
watch this
I woke up this Thursday morning in a terrible mood
I went straight to the kitchen because I needed some food
Come in, the kitchen door told me what I would see
A giant stacking dirty dishes is waiting for me
Spill all my funky tequila and my feline hat
Tell my [partner, "Hmm, I think I'm going for a walk"
I see my friend in the corner, "What's up, Terry T?"
He said he knew a lady he needed to know
Super good as wine and couldn't be beat
I said, "Okay," he said, "Come in," then we went to his house.
And here I'm cold, like I'm in disgrace
He had a beautiful smile, eyes greener than grass.
And damn it, boy, you should see that right
I don't want to be explicit, but you know what I mean
The type of girl who doesn't recover from a magazine.
She said her name was Limay, she didn't know what to say
We go out and have a drink, talk a little
Terry said we had to go, but then he told me to sit down.
She said "Terry, you can go, but Ryan is staying awhile"
When he said this to my friend, I started to smile.
She says she wanted to talk, so she could get to know me a little more.
I said "great"
Terry left and then closed the door
Now I'm a really cool type of guy, really soft on her
And when she came and stood next to me, I had sweat on my palms
I mean she was so good, I can't explain it to my brothers.
Finer than the dilla album cover Ice T
I said, "Well, here we are. What can we do now?"
She said: "Ryan D., as difficult as it may seem, I want to make love to you, you are the man of my dreams"
He said he had seen me before, and then he knew that day.
I said, "Baby, don't worry, because I think I'm in love. You are the angel of my life, sent from heaven above"
Without hesitation, we were deeply immersed
Just with persistent movements, I took off her clothes
She was heavy as the kiss that started to moan
First she starts, pull me back, I really don't know how
She put her arms around my neck and said "I love you now"
She was already hot, she had started to sweat
I knew this would be a time that I would never forget
She told me to lie on my back so I can climb to the top
She said, "Make it last, please, and don't stop."
I got up, rubbed my eyes
It was then that I realized I was home in my bed
I said "damn it" to myself, as difficult as it seems
Imagination had to go, but it was just a dream.
It was a fantasy
Nothing but a fantasy
Damn man. That's hard man
Man, it was removed
Isn't that weird, though? We both feel like this?
Just remember that shit, man
Word
I don't know what to tell you, man
Hey, see you later, friend
Well. But do you know what it was?
It was a fantasy
Nothing but a fantasy
We fell in love with a fantasy
We fell in love with a fantasy
We fell in love with a fantasy
Look look
Every single one of my thoughts is caught up in the cream collection
A black fact; imagine me dying in a gun fire
Won't retire until I get paid, raise base
When we ride, we fly, bitches blow me kisses
Niggas from Compton to Brooklyn let's get your riches
Rolling niggas from Long Beach to Long Isl '
I barely smile because my heart froze
And now I have One Nation, it's a crooked compilation
Just to end the shit, let's make money again
Tell the hunters that I rolled controlling the house
My shit is so wicked when I turn around, niggas shut their mouths
The Cocoa Brodaz, Buckshot the BDI Thug
Greg Nice, L.S., Asu, so show black love, Outlaw!
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high because you never know when you're going
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we bloat life because you never know when you're going
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high because you never know when you're going
Top Billin, make a million
Paparazzi, chase us through the tunnel in the Maserati
On probation for theft
There is no need to answer a plea, there is no need to stop a G
I'm on 6, you have to jump on 3, company monopoly
They call me the given gift
Even rottweilers, go on, the Impala
Do you want to talk about this concrete? black I'm a scholar
The incredible, hetero-sexual, credible.
I beg a hoe, let it go, the cock is not edible
Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit
While you chose the motherfuckers who gave transcripts
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high because you never know when you're going
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high because you never know when you're going
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we bloat life
You can't break me, never make my heart beat
Miss Delores Tucker sued me, I won't stop
Until we get justice for these corrupt cops on my block
Time Warner full of ladybugs, tell everyone to miss me
A group of hypocrites who whistle at Dixie
You cowards knew you couldn't bear the pressure.
I'm going to make you feel, trust me
Did I cry when they dropped me? (nah), can you stop me? (it will not)
Tryna sells 4 million copies (done)
If I wasn't spitting it would be prison or death
This rap game all we have left
So try to understand where we come from
And we can not stop
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high because you never know when you're going
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we bloat life because you never know when you're going
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high because you never know when you're going
Live a bitch and then you die, that's why we bloat life
{Omar Epps - Q}
You are a crazy man!
{2Pac - Bishop}
You know what? When you said that last time
I was kind of stumbling, but now
You're right i'm crazy
But do you know what else? I don't give a shit
check it out
Is it money or women at funny beginnings, tragic ends?
I'd rather be buried than worried, living under pressure
My game plan to be trained heavy, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sitting in the graveyard
Crying, I've been lost since my teens calling to Jesus
Ballin 'like a young man, wondering if he sees us
Young black boys, crack sales hit me three times
Living in prison, this is hell, enemies die
I wonder when we all pass by if someone listens?
I've got my hands on my semi shotty, everyone's snitchin '
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Lead us all, before we fall into madness
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches with their jaws clenched
Come on niggas wanna put it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas on my click that make their jaws clenched now
Come on niggas wanna put it on, let's fight!
Got some niggas on my click that make them clench their jaws
Come on niggas wanna put it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas on my click that make their jaws clenched now
Come on niggas wanna do it, let's fight
Got some niggas on my click that make them clench their jaws
Bad temper
Throw them folded
{2Pac - Bishop}
You have to take away some necklaces and let the motherfuckers meet you there to get them out
{Xzibit}
Love is lost, the gloves are gone, so imagine
Which side are you dealing with, the barrel or the trigger?
A gang of niggas talking, but not walking in a straight line
They try to hide behind the one time
Fuck, be scary and constantly safely
I'm not afraid of whatever fags treat me
Shoot me, try to corner me, the helpers try to reach me
And have you run for your fucking life?
Until they put me in court fighting for mines
When niggas mutter under my breath, I'm under their skin, so
I pray forcibly to handle what my city brings
Better stop for something, or you're bound to fall in love with anything
The pitfalls, the potholes, I spit out flows that generate direct sales of crack, we have those
A batter who abandons split a black like an embryo
Take him to his crib, to his children, to his video session
Give me the loot, my debts are paid
The half scared rat packed up and sprayed
You are transparent, Reynold's envelope, I see it clearly
Mister rack rack the meter and kick the do '
And motherfuckers try to say I couldn't rap without mo '
Let's go!
Dirty Harry
I'm a swindler until it's over, motherfucker
Do you have the heart to see a black, before bursting?
Bustin 'motherfuckers out of the box, I'm not even going!
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From making movies to bustin tricks outside the fucking frame
I got these bitches on my athlete, niggas on my block
Jealous fools got them out of my smoker glock
And bustin 'niggas asses to stay alive
Skinny ass gamer looking at fingerlings of older motherfuckers
Buckin 'busters' till they die
Lord forgive me
Hennessy made me not know how to act
I'm falling and I can't go back
Until I die
You walk with your head down, scared to look
God bless my soul
They ran me out of the police, where to go
With the lights off, rolling down a dirt road
With the lights off, rolling down a dirt road
But I won't live, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather shoot my target, oh shit!
Is that all you got, man?
That black P-Double has that shit for all of you
Peoples to rock, stirring pots of beer
In hell's kitchen, I cook the impossible
Sit down and have dinner with the best rap representatives
We the streets that are watching, boy, move diligently
Infamous
I could catch myself in a burgundy chair, my shirt is locked
Cool with my scarf and Timbs, we got out of there
Army bags full of money, bulletproof
And that too, put something on the ceiling
Niggas shooting from windows, we're untouchable
Yeah we're rich thugs, they shoot the clubs
Create albums that click more than little drugs
They ran me out of the police, where to go
With the lights off, rolling down a dirt road
But I won't live, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather shoot my target
They ran me out of the police, where to go
With the lights off, rolling down a dirt road
Niggas know it's not me to sleep, I'm under pressure
I have to sleep with my room, an extra clip next to my dresser
I want nothing more than a niggas trip and, that's it
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
It's a man's world, niggas are played, another street
I hope to live to see another day, hey!
These hidden capes are sweating me
I have to pay but all the drama attached
Am I going to explode when it's time to shoot? Do not even ask
Don't turn around, I won't give up, cause I don't care
Cunt bitches better bury me, bury me!
They ran me out of the police, where to go
But I won't live, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather shoot my target
They ran me out of the police, where to go
With the lights off, rolling down a dirt road
I'd rather shoot my target, oh shit! (x2)
A love for my friends, death for my enemies.
Bad boy killaz, Outlaw muthafuckin 'Immortalz
Do you know what time it is
When we ride (when we ride)
Thug niggas until the day of our death
Tell me baby, what's your frequency?
You see I'm making proposals that are full of verbal indecency when you find me
I've got three hits, you've got these last nights for thugs
Holding my position, my competition is never ready
So what they tell me through the vine
Retaliation takes time
Create rhymes so fierce that the bass line
I went for my voice every time a black man says his rhyme
Nigga freaks out, I'm eternally thuggin '
Like kamikazes on a suicide mission
I'm spitting multiple blazing shots, making rappers victims
I make it rough enough, you and Puffy crawl away
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you face to face
First to bombard, quick to download
Keeping blacks suspicious
Two Glocks is full of ammunition
My army uniform ready for battle, lyrical command
Tell me nigga, how much can you handle
Hitting wax, I turn this track into a Roman candle (boom)
My intention is specifically, he did not throw sympathy
Images of closed coffins, as soon as Daz gets me
As soon as my niggas break, earthquakes all over the planet
The adversaries cannot understand it
Nobody die unless we have planned
No matter how hard muthafuckaz tries, they can't understand it
Westside, outlaw until we die, thug life
Muthafuckaz on the trip and us
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size
Call me my enemy assassin, when I see you face to face
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you face to face
Nigga, I've been fighting for years
There is nothing good here
I get the beat of the drum, that's how I get over the fear
Give me your soul, life, give it to me like I'm Christ
I look to death to be nice, I want to try it some nights
And I swear to God, I get medieval on your shipwreck
Mom told you to knock me unconscious, but you're still not crazy
Claiming you mobbin 'deep, with your pity team
If you're a soldier, ask him, friend, could it be you and me?
Head first, I'll kill your job, I've got you lost so it hurts
A hectic combination, then I leave your dick in the dirt
Nigga, I leave you surprised
From project streets to cell blocks
Glock 45 with tail cocked
Makin 'jacks in no way
Pocket full of crack and money in my jeans
Wildin 'on ya street high off codeine's (codeine's)
I ask a few questions after opening fire on your sector.
On the fucking ride
Uh
How many niggas really think they can object?
Dumpin ', but taking it first in every function
Nigga, we're playing punches [?]
It's hitting your jaw and now you're hitting the flo '
You obviously didn't know what we knew about '
Nigga us
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size

First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you face to face
Yeah ... hitting niggas to shit
Yeah nigga you know how we do it when we get up your bitch ass
I got three hits, you got these last night for thugs
Holding my position, my competition is never ready
Torn like a machete, my alias Makaveli
So what they tell me through the vine
Retaliation takes time
Create rhymes so fierce that the bass line
I went for my voice every time a black man says his rhyme
Spending and bustin 'you thought about it, but you weren't ready
Nigga freaks out, I'm eternally thuggin '
Like Kamikazes on a suicide mission
I'm spitting multiple blazing shots, making rappers victims
I kick them all day
And our motto was to make them all pay
Do you think you're rude enough? Nigga you crawl away
Come and be my enemy killa, when I see you face to face
First to bombard, right outside the door, nigga, fuck next to you
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
It was then that the killing began, it was when I murdered your friend
You're a crazy madman thinking he's running back, running
Running through the streets again, with AK and Mac-10
This by escaping the heaters [?]
You and your friend are gone, when we get closer to you
And we ride like a roller, every dog to talk
5 double or B-E-N-Z DAG
DPG showing the place to be
Wow this [?] Will divide the boy flat
Leaving fools stuck
Gang bang bang
I'm from the crazy ass bitch
Always down for intent
Nigga, you know we're a ghetto for fo
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size

It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
Keeping niggers suspicious, 2 Glocks
Lyrical command, let's start
Tell me nigga, how much can you handle
Hitting wax, I turn the track into a Roman candle (boom)
My intention specifically, foolish, without sympathy
Images of closed coffins, as soon as Daz is with me
I'm the first to bomb, first is calm, then panic
The adversaries cannot understand it
The way my niggas strategize
Nobody die unless we have planned
All my life committed, I write songs and spit them out
No matter how much motherfuckers try, they can't understand it
It's West Coast, Westside, Outlawz 'until we die, Thug Life
Mothafuckas on the trip and we--
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size
Come and be my enemy killa, when I see you face to face
First to bombard, right outside the door, nigga, fuck next to you
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size
It's Makaveli with Dillinger when it's time to ride
I come from battle rap, nigga imagine that
For every nigga you got, I got the party
Nigga, you better give up nigga or die for her place
Cash and jewelry make my revenges a little blind
My vision is not blurry, I told mom don't worry
Now I have the streets tied, the stripes in glory
If I live to tell a story about gangsters and thugs
Friends [?] That drug through the mud
Herb, money, alcohol, with AK
Lapel sprayed for your drug and you're not
Come beat up and then you bend over to shoot niggas, motherfucker
Come and be my enemy killa, when I see you face to face
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck your size
First to bomb, right outside the door, nigga, fuck off

Flex, flex flex
Flex, flex flex
Let's play a game, call to catch a bitch, how do you play?
Well dissolve me nigga and catch a fist, are you playing?
Ooo, I know you didn't expect a nigger to catch the wreckage
I'm coming from the west, everyone was sleeping (Flex)
Because it's been a long day
And I get Johnny Q when niggas rub me the wrong way
Twenty-four tracks are fat and all that
Pack smack, jaw crack, after that, can I get my balls back?
Nigga don't face it, just pass the blunt
I make you jump
So here it comes, let's have a gun
Bomb bomb!
Flex, flex, flex flex
Flex, flex flex
Flex, flex flex
OH! duck, get ready to throw nigga, throw that butt
Give us crazy accessories and pack, I'm crazy
So take that step, walk the damn wrong man
The crew too, fifty niggas in the wrong clan
Damn bitch, you better take your ass home
Boom boom boom niggas better duck or get rejected
Fuck caught in the damn gut
I try to tell you but blacks don't feel me
Fuck with the dollar, wouldn't that be?
Born for erection, breed in the pile
Schoolin ', I'm ready to feel pain I bet your butt
It will fill in the
Dirty guy, then you say hello when I pass
A nigga try to act fly God bless the good try
Slammin 'powder, you got a little nerve

If they want to be a
Flex, flex, flex flex

Flex, flex flex
Hey me, nothing costs fast money
When he fucks and Thoro Headz stays
See it's fifty niggas with me, it's a hundred raw heads
Not to mention countless, I'm not your ammo
You can't fade the best as you lie down
Yes, still smashed, you're testing your check-filled microphone
Niggas wanna flex it
They call me Big Mac, you put the fucking whore
And i'm out
Five dodge and you will never doubt me
I'm flammy on this 2Pac jammy
Me, sitting and pissing in a bitch panties
Yes, like magic, let's go to that massive ass
You better touch or kick your butt
And if you plan to rush, you better stomp fast
Because on the floor, I took a plaque that marks your ass
They should give that motherfucker some of that real shit
So fuck a rhyme if you feel what I want for tacs
See you back, nigga, 'cause we don't give up
Thoro Headz motherfucker
Big Malcolm, motherfucker indo boy
So when I fall and die they'll take the shit
All of you weak motherfuckers have the motherfucker [?]
Young niggas, young niggas
You say you will love me forever, but what about today?
As the sunsets dawn and the years go by, you will love me the same way
If so, let us rejoice and bathe in constant pleasure
I just wanted to know if you would love me forever
Before today I would BEGIN!
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're just looking at the skies
Hoping for the best but hoping for the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not?
Can you imagine when this race is won?
Praising our leaders, we are tuning in
Music is played by crazy men
Always young, I want to be always young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Do you really want to live forever? Forever Young
As I laugh, pushing the gas as my Glocks explode
We were young and stupid but we had a heart
In the dark we will survive through the bad parts
Don't hesitate to exterminate these snitches
Envious bitches, they still keep chasing me
A couple of movies, now everyone's trying to fuck me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, drinking 22 beer
And now the media is trying to test me
Misery is all I see, that's my state of mind
My story with the police will shake up the crime rate
Two strikes, slipped, was arrested and flipped
Always young, I want to be always young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Always young, I want to be always young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever Young
Now every time I see you cats are rolling in packs
For the life of me I can't see why you don't know how to act
I love clowns when you dig deep, but when you're on that solo crawling through the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga, it's a damn shame, someone explain
Why did they send a bad boy to play an adult man's game?
Tear that ass off the frame, kick it all the way
I woke up on the street, but you'll be sleeping in the coffin
How long will it last? Nigga don't ask, just be the first to shoot
My shit is classic, like my black Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation looking ahead until we break
Money made me wicked, court cases stressed me out
Niggas pointing at my head, but I still wear my vest
I don't give a shit, motherfuckers, I'm crazy
Everybody ducks when my gun smokes
You are not shit without your friends
Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we are tuning in
Music is played by crazy men
Always young, I want to be always young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Always young, I want to be always young
Now I was born alone, I took my first joint and I drugged myself
Now I'm a black outlaw, I never die alone
My niggas and I are so close, it's complicated
A nigga smoking and drinking, and yet we all vanished
My black Edi had a son, everyone happy
Because now that little Ridah has to deal with eight dads
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers, everyone dies
I've been trying to win a million for Hustlin since my teens
From crack to rap villian, my new profession
Who wants to see me in 8D, 3D fuck
Coward motherfuckers will never see me
Bustin 'with automatic straps, my raps raw like good crack
Hell niggas, I've got them coming back
Forever, my niggas be together
It's not shit without your friends
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're just looking at the skies
Hoping for the best but hoping for the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not?
Can you imagine when this race is won?
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we are tuning in
Music is played by crazy men
Always young, I want to be always young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Always young, I want to be always young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever Young
(Laughter) We go platinum black, we go platinum
We got my nigga Treach from Naughty By Nature in this motherfucker
My black Apache in this motherfucker
My Mossberg fires, give me room, can I catch it?
Speaking faster than a victim who is trying to avoid being criticized
I had enough, I hit those bastards
Boo-yaa, turn this Benz into a coffin
Buck Buck, big and reckless alive
Niggas with a death wish step in with a TEC and I'm going to wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
True to what I am writing, representing and hitting like a viper
Huh, I made up my mind, I have my nine
Ring the alarm and strong arm what's mine
I'm old-fashioned, run to me nigga and they criticize me
With five deadly venomz
That deadly old shit. Aiyyo Treach where are you?
Take a step forward and hit the ass with evil)
We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
For the Onyx of your nose, punk is funky like blunt skunks
Smelled like funk pussy
I come to take you through a tough and rugged war
And if there are other doubts, I will fly your fucking mother
I scream: "I'm from MC with a disgusting mouf!" and kick the bitch
Sue me? I pay the lawyer for you oh boy yeah
Also, my style weighs between ten and twenty pounds more
I get you faster than a picture of a punk already picking up shit
Don't steal, I'm building the store
Once you sound hot, because if you're not a perfect ten
My signal is to stop!
There are twenty malicious and corrupt styles in them
Like the women I made them, I'm in the deadly poison ready
Yes, as I take a breath I get hard, Big Mad
To put it on, no one can come stronger to see
Breaking them, I make them see their destiny
Steal, steal and run away from the coppers
Whoever holds a rock turns the gun controller
Younger, reckless, crazy, mess
That many cops can't stop me until my head pops out
It's a mess, I come for the blood splatter
I make them scatter, leaving traces of brains and bladders
Blowin 'em out of the frame without shame
I play tight, drop a body and then get out of sight
Count my loot after shooting, stop my kicks and it's
Something I don't want to do, something I never did
I try to catch it, I think I hit them, turned it on
He is out! A poison, a deadly poison
(Yeah crazy, fuck that! You know how we do it
Now you know that a black like me has to represent)
Again, back to shit, quick on the flip tip
The psychopath represents the real to take the flow of the microphone
Deadly, shake your head G, check the tune
Niggas can't touch me when I destroy G, you better run away
Because I am endowed with a jab and a forty-four Mag
Uhh, boom, you slipped, now you're buckled
No kidding, you'll be yolk, no matter how it sounds
We're taking all the fake niggas back to the footsteps
Align them in a single file, dome running on them
A nigger hit them with the poison, the fourth deadly poison
(Nigga, you know what I'm saying? Fuck it!
I told you, we got along, I 'Pac.)
Five deadly venomz verse five be the most alive
Fighting and fighting, keep a nine on my waist
Take mine, you'd better bury me, G
Punk ass niggas don't even bother me, look
I have a Glock that says' Pac runs the block
As I sit and remember the old days
I say niggas need you to care
Until they do, I pull out a clip and grab my nine
Now it's on every day, it could be my last day
That's why I explode on her butt when I passed, I let the glass spray
Deadly Venomz
(Hahaha, yeah, pass that shit around here
Apache fights to clean the shit up)
Raise your middle finger! The track for the maniac begins
All I'm giving is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell you how hard I get
I pop shit behind your back, get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't go in because my door is bigger, I'm a black snake
My act protects me so much that I pull the damn trigger
I am child's play in a clinch, your blow is like a pinch.
Fucking whores, cut them like cold cuts
Asphyxiate them with the lace of my boot, then leave them hanging like old walnuts
Cut and move, it's time to get them
Those are the results of fucking with the fifth poison in denim
(Yes, do you know what I'm saying?
Five damn deadly venomz, in effect for ninety-three
Ninety-four ninety-five all that other shit
We take this motherfucker for this biggest blow
YaknowhatI'msayin? Follow us, come. Yaknowhat I'm I'mayin?
We took this son of a bitch away. TRUST. Us out)
This poem is addressed to 2 Mrs. Hawkins
I'm not out 2 offends positive souls
only the racist dogs that lied to me
An American culture riddled with nights
like the night Yusef was killed
if it were reversed it would be work
of a savage but this white assassin was only strong-willed
But Mrs. Hawkins as sure as I am a panther
America will never rest
if Yusef dies in vain!
West coast after the store (come on)
Shake your damn hands in the air
For all my bitches and my niggas
(We don't give a shit, we don't give a shit)
Shake your damn hands in the air
Look at these other fools but you can't see me, nigga
Who I am?
So slow down your roll, I'm in control like Janet
The twenty-one-year-old nigga on this planet.
Take it for granted, if you want, because I'm going to
Grab my leash and then wipe the corner, beeotch
So all my bitches and my niggas
Shake your damn hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
To all my niggas and my bitches
Shake your damn hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your damn hands up in the air
Now in one, two, three, who could it be?
So ninety-four blacks came back
Now no one can see me here or there
Wherever it comes out, I put it everywhere
Because it's not shit for sale in the Coupe
With the rhythm flossin 'gold D's
And my cousin Snoop is fine, you know what I mean
And it doesn't take long for Dogg's pound to pop a cap
In your ass, for making us screwed
Now check it out, it's a call for niggas like Doggs
Who is the shit supposed to be, but constantly biting like hoes?
(Yes, all of you) other Doggs (yes, all) yiggy, all of you
Stay full of that gin and juice and have fun
I pack a strap like this, kick it like this
Now how many bitches should be fucked?
Before they say, okay, Daz, that nigger of the time
You never thought I would see it bustin with Dr. Dre
Because I grab microphones, rip microphones in half
Hoes will come to my flat so I can touch that butt
So all my bitches and my niggas
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Shake your damn hands in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches and my bitches and my niggas
Shake your damn hands in the air
And if you don't give a shit like we don't give a shit
Keep your damn hands up in the air
And my niggas say, we want fame!
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Seeking fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain, caught in this game
Seeking fortune and fame
Although we exist to reproduce, some believe that the currency reaches the G
Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
They made me hot when they shot me, plotted my revenge
To increase my ends, the enemies fall
Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay faithful
Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
And for fame, niggas change fast, it's a shame
What to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? The world seems strange sometimes
A little crazy, I hope we can change over time
I'm living blinded, seeking curse of refinement
And worse still, with each breath, steps I take, out of breath.
Is there a cure for a scammer with a death wish?
Cigar ashes, glass toast, glasses
We crushed each other on those jealous bastards, with my balaclava
I'm the first to want it ruined
Wrapped in plastic, the shit hit his ass (Outlawz)
There's nothing left now, treated like a stepson was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches will be rock rhythms, fake in fame
(Fuck everyone)
Something we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain, caught in this game
Seeking fortune and fame
Something we all adore
Something we die for
Seeking fortune and fame
Fold nigga fold
It's my black cell phone, it's my cell phone
Oh yeah, do you have that chicken, nigga?
Hey, how does that shit snag, though how does that shit snag?
Can i get some
I love that 2Pac shit (that Pac shit)
I'm that nigga out of your window eating chicken out of your caddy shit (shit)
We wrote this song to make you kill motherfuckers (motherfuckers)
Smash motherfuckers (motherfuckers)
Just to see you, cluck clucka (clucka)
I'm not just a rapper, I'm a drug dealer (drug man!)
And I ignore the son of a bitch spray cap peeler (cap peela)
It's like the bass (bass) How low can you go? (Go! Go! Go)
I'll have to move my yay around San Di-ya-yo (ya-yo baby)
Westcoast, tax free, money is a bitch (beotch)
These niggas out of state get mad because we're rich (hahaha, richhh)
Collect a super chicken bac-ca (bac-ca, bac-ca)
He said selling 28 and a hundred
By mail...
To be known (known) in this society
Because when I lift my block mane, my cost is to floss
I scream (scream) until I lost myself forever, no one came (fame)
So on this day, I will die for fortune and fame (fame)
I have been in my name (fame) where all these years that I walked this earth were
I went for all of mine (we seek fame) especially been cautious from birth
Although I live my life hellishly (fame) for all this fame (fame)
Block fronts shoot slugs, we throw them back like hard balls
There is no love for these false hopeless and thugs (hahaha)
I bleed to envy
Smoke and turn off, dull sipping Henny
Drunk nights and high days
Raising my heat shooting it sideways
A life on the run (hey care, care)
Fulfilling my destiny for needs and wants
I'll be throwing all my cabbage like pliers
Caught in trance looking for something higher
May fortune and fame
Hahaha
Something we all adore
Something we die for
Nothing but pain, caught in this game
Something we all adore
Something we die for
Nothing but pain, caught in this game
Seeking fortune and fame
I don't want to live forever, is to do or die
It would be a dead black man talking gangsta S.P.I
Blacks don't want it to be in their system when I pass away
Talk shit when I'm in the coffin nigga, you'll rest in peace (well it's alright)
Motherfucker, I'm dying for this shit, I've gotten rid of a lot
Some niggas are players in the game five years
Some niggas will be making a platinum album
Fucking hard since I was fo-teen, mates (part-fo-teen)
Some niggas are lying down on their streets, they broke something appropriately
Haters can try to take your soul cold-hearted niggas
Blacks don't want to see that you have nothing, so have something
And if a nigga runs you over, put a bullet and start shooting nigga
Fame...
Something we all adore
Something we die for
Trapped in this pain, trapped in this game
Seeking fortune and fame
Something we all adore
Something we die for
Nothing but pain, caught in this game
Nothing but pain ...
Trapped in this gaaaaaame
(Yes Yes Yes)
Why don't they sing some shit man acapella?
(How many rare ladies are there tonight?)
(All the ladies say scare me!)

What should I do
To show how much
I think about freek'n you?
Yeah that's not the shit we came to say
They motherfuckers want to hear "How do you want it?"
You heard that shit, nigga
Oh me, what are you going with that big ass?
My ghetto love song, light it up, light it up
Where my niggas, where my niggas
Where are my niggas, all my real niggas
Where my niggas, where my niggas
Let's be friends, throw your hands in the air
No need to face
Let's see that you only throw your hands in the air
Let's be friends, Westside on this motherfucker here
Throw your hands up in the air, Westside
All in my double 'R', tinted
My eye is freshly scented
What is happy baby? What happens?
Come find me and maybe ma'am
Can you help me multiply my stacks, baby
The coin seems small, I need company
I bet your man ain't shit, ain't shit
So why are you hesitating?
Look at my diamonds, bitch, they'll all blink
This is a nigger thug paid for thugs with riches
Cream dreaming motherfucka in a puree for bitches
Smoking big weed, typed the Cali road, Westside!
I do not like to cheat but I will buy you what fits
I can't stand any diaper-headed bitch wearing sneakers
Let my pedigree breathe reason, this' OG
Put the whore hunters to sleep without penalty
Mash in my car called, that man
While I'm tugging on your bitch's hand, Westside
Understand this, there ain't no nigga like me
Fuck Jay Z, he's broke and I smoke daily

Because I know you want to fuck
Let's be friends, there's no need to be in the front, let's be friends

Although a little blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass, you make me check for you hardcore
Watching and watching, you and me one by one
Erotic, psychotic, I would own my body
Far from falling in love, I want to burst your guts
And touch everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweating like a fat girl going for mine
Only a skinny nigger is fucking like he stole my mind
In the past I remember how it used to be
I guess money and fame got you used to it
What about nine and six, good tricks on drag
Damn Dre, tell that bitch, 'He can kiss my butt'
Back to you, my pretty candy queen
I have my hands on your thighs, now leave me in the middle as friends
Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks?
I prepared her for a booty call, I caught your bitch
Was it me or fame, my dick or the game?
I bet you yell 'Westside' when I came, Westside
Up and down, similar to switches
My move, baby, let your back dip into it, make it fluid
In and out, all around when a nigga does it
You got me stoned, let me in
I love it when you get up baby let me ride
Who wants to stop me? Am I first class?
Fuck the niggas who hate players because they lock their dick
What is the game, I prefer to see a black man in prison?
He made a living with bad words, liquor and grass
A bad seed became good in this world of G
Baby got me fantasizing, seeing you naked
It's a shit song, check the record, so check my record
Make money, take money, let's be paid
Pawhoo hoo hoo hoo

With that outrageous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
So why do you hesitate, act like your shit doesn't stink?
Look at my diamonds, bitch, they'll all blink
This is a thang thug, a black outlaw with riches
Cream dreamin ', motherfucker, in a puree for bitches
Look at my resume, taking Cristal and Alize
Smoking on big grass, he keyed the Cali road
I don't like to cheat, but I'll buy you a fit
I can't stand any diaper-headed bitch
Leave my pedigree, read briefly, this O.G

Everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweating like a fat girl going for mine
Just a skinny nigger fucking like he stole my mind

Up and down, similar to switches
My move, baby, let your back dip into it, make it fluid
In and out, all around when a nigga does it
You got me stoned, let me in!
I love it when you go up, baby, let me ride.
Who wants to stop me? Am I first class?
The shit player hates niggas because they lock dick
You probably hate seeing a real bully with vision, what's the game?
He made a living with bad words, liquor and grass
A bad seed became good in this world of G
Baby got me fantasizing, seeing you naked
It's a shit song, now check the record

Make money, take money
Make money, take money
Make money, take money
Make money, take money
Come on put your cash
Let's pay
Listening to the radio, wishing I could rap
Because everyone in the industry was fucking me, man
Listens; I have a plan, break up, do my thing
Leave some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas don't wanna see me get up
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers to size
And if I find another case, God knows how they hate me
I have a player in the courtroom, please don't let me be framed
I have been dealt many bad cards living like a bully
Count my blessings and cast my tensions on this loveless land
Maybe they see me rolling, look at all this green I have
I understand why they envy and puff up their eyes
Waiting for the heavenly father to love a scammer
Meet the toughest nigga on Earth who's ever snapped a nut
My friends tell me: "Have a heart", fuck your feelings
I've been trying to make a million since we started, we had a cold heart
I emptied my clip, it's time to puree, they asked for it
I, Makaveli, am a son of a bitch.
Niggas talk a lot of shit, I choose to ignore it
Now what will you do, when my niggas come for you
Now what will you do, when my niggas come for you
Tell me now what are you gonna do when my niggas
Is it coming for you?
Now what will you do, when my niggas come for you
Look at me clown, give me love when I'm high
I'm an outlaw baby, I'll be hitting until I die
In my double-R drop-top, life as a rap star
Go ask someone at your show
Look at them niggas at the sight of my night reach
Cooking white dope made my 25 year old nigga stretch
Trying to have the best things in life.
Well Makaveli - a born leader, 10 millimeters
Change a black's future as a palm schizophrenic reader
And the strong will lead
Hitting the grass like it's alright
I'm in the studio making music all night
My enemies cry every time I get up, they hated to death
Trying to beat myself on my last breath
What are you going to do?
Tell me now what are you gonna do when my niggas
Is it coming for you?
Is it coming for you?
What are you gonna do when my niggas come for you?
Who is to blame for my mental frames?
This poverty game makes money
Got me demonized for the riches they want to kill for proving fame
Recurring 'dreams of more illustrious ears, magazine covers
Living life like a hooligan queen
But instead, I have nightmares
They are called premonitions outside the law of premeditated missions
Living conditions are suspicious, so I was put on the list of results
Wishing I slipped like a wet bitch
And I've been waiting for years, I put my routine in black
I see you smoking, because I have what you want to flaunt
Every calculated move is a nail in your coffin
Launched a female war call
Now what are you going to do?
(When we come for you)
What are you gonna do when my niggas come for you?
Now, black now, what are you going to do when my blacks come for you?
What are you gonna do when my niggas come for you?
(Raise your hands) Now what will you do when my niggas come for you
(Whatchu running for '), now what will you do when my niggas come for you?
(Busted) What are you gonna do when my niggas for you?
(when we come for you)
Now what will you do when my niggas for you
Hahaha
(When they come for you)
(When they come for you)
Shhh
When they come for you
At first glance, I know exactly what it would be
Circumstances don't even matter because my heart never lies
And if you don't admit this, it's you who will be surprised
"I thought I had friends, but I don't have fucking friends
I thought I had friends, but I have no friends "
I do not need anyone
Fuck you ... fuck you all (fuck you all)
The money went to hell friends, I need a friend who knows me
When all these fucking cops are with me
Now what the hell is going on with my cats?
Remember me? I'm your friend who fought
Drinking Hennessy, hanging out with the clowns, and everything
What we used to do is drink beer, screw and common knowledge
We had bitches by the dozen, fucking cousins
A nigga just got paid and we were still broke
It took time, but finally the cash was mine
All the rewards of a scammer caught in the rut
I look around, and all I see are snakes and fakes
It's like scavengers, waiting to take the place of a scammer
They have burst and cannot be trusted; Fuck off!
"I thought I had friends, but I don't have fucking friends
I thought I had friends, but I have no friends "
Fuck all of you
I'm drinking Tanqueray and juice and what's the use
‘Because I'm a hopeless thug
There's no love remembering how close we were
Far back in the day, before they put the crack in the way
And heeyyy, how much money can you stack in one day?
It's getting hard, picking up calls from my niggas in handcuffs
I remember we used to dance, now just living is enough
I stay upright in winter, summer, spring or fall
I know you're going crazy after dark, these marks
Keep running away and puffing, there's no fear in my heart
What's going on in the ghetto? Still fight and fight
I keep rolling with the heater, smoking Thai chocolate
In '94, I'll go alone
Too many problems of my own, so I'm filming intent; fuck all of you!
Huh, forgive me!
I thought I had friends, but I don't have ... "
Fuck all of you ... Fuck all of you
I went from rags to riches
I went from a bucket to a rag with switches
I'm getting high and like I said it was some Thai chocolate
Mixed with some Indonesian, watch me fly
And though I know the cops behind me
Hit the grass and I keep doing 90
Until they catch me, another ticket will kick it in court
Fuck the law, I don't give a shit, I'm even worse than before
I know they want to see a black man buried
But I'm not worried, I still throw these thangs
Locked me in these chains
And hey, nigga, what the fuck are you crying about?
As soon as I get to the cell, I will leave
And when I go out, I'm in a hurry to dance
I'm yelling "Thug Life!", Nigga, fuck off!
"I thought I had friends, but I don't have fucking friends
I thought I had friends, but I don't have screwed friends
I thought I had friends, but I don't have screwed friends
I thought I had friends, but I don't have screwed friends
I thought I had friends, but I have no friends "
That's right, fuck all of you, man
Fuck all of you
Fuck all the printouts of the daily news
Fuck all of you
Fuck off
Are you a what? Bad Boy Killaz
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
Hahaha, yes, nigga, fuck everyone!
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
Fuck all of you motherfuckers!
Ayo, Biggie, put your hands up!
My rappin 'is similar to motherfuckers when they throw away
Blast and watch them recede
Notorious Biggie Killer, affiliation with death row
Niggas take off their caps, fool, this is the west coast
Bitch, misdemeanor, I'm going to hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli directly from prison to sell these
Intoxicated, we duplicate but we never faded
Now that we have, my opponents are players who hate
I have a Mercedes for these tricks, which I thought I gave up
Then I got a top Jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smoking bud in the back
I wait for the niggas to shoot because, bitch, I love to throw away
Mama raised me like a black thug, with love niggas
I'm a millionaire I started as a drug dealer
I went from trusting these tricks
Now everyone wants to sue me, so fuck everyone!
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
Come raise your hands in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
I am addicted to these streets, as crack is to these hairs on end
Seeing visions of a prison, wake up screaming while I sleep
Is there a heaven in this hell? A chance to live well?
But if they kill me, I have my sores and who to tell
When choosing to sell, I prefer to die and die
Now raise your damn hands if you're a rider (Ride)
Shoot them all, touch them all; we do it like this
Come on, fuck you, watch that bitch nigga lose it
Man I'm as strong as this game, you'll know my name
A very nervous young black thug created by pain
And my next piece of ass, so fuck 'em all!
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
I do my dirt for my loneliness
I don't need no fake friend to call me
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
So don't feel comfortable, I'm running you
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
Nigga, we horsemen outlaws
Don't mind if you love us, we're killing
I was glad the bags with enemies, I cut to remind me
Soaked in Hennessy, so your family members know it's me
Ridin 'these hoochies like they're heavy ass Chevy impalas
Jump and shoot your butt
I'm bustin 'with self defense, you see
Poppin 'nobody got' em, holla
Empty the scene, count the cash and hide the precious metal
Here come the coppers, the S.W.A.T. equipment and helicopters
Crackers are crazy, why? ‘Because they will never stop us
I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger pop someone in a movie
Niggas is over too, true to the game
I claim outlaw riders, we don't give a damn what they try, I'm ...
‘Because Young Noble behind this
Relax, lil 'nigga, and watch the game
Make your mob swing and what not
We keep it exploding, like a place of drugs
The streets know what's hot, trust me.
Even my hood calls me "baby Malcolm X"
With the TECs, bathe them some slugs
Always in a bad mood, hurry to find food
Have you ever seen Faces of Death? That's what my 9 do
Even rapping with a gat, I must be going crazy
As if against the world, this guerrilla team of mine
Even if the last nigger left, I will travel for them
Feel me? Until they kill me, that's how I'm rolling
"Fuck everyone, let them die!" That is my slogan. Fuck everyone!
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
Come raise your hands in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
I do my dirt for my loneliness
I don't need no fake friend to call me
So don't feel comfortable, I'm running you
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
(That's right, bitch, fuck everyone!)
Do you want to know how I did this shit? Do you want to know how real my shit is?
Nigga, go read the damn newspaper, nigga trick
How many broken rappers have something to say?
I sit down and strategize, in due time bitches pay
Also, all day long, I puff grass until my eyes bleed red
Look at this, I know your niggas don't want me
But how the hell does your whole clique become thugs, dude?
Like misdemeanors, it's a little problem
You niggas ain't ready for war, let my balls hang
Bust Bad Boy, Mobb Deep and assassin The Firm
When you yell "fake thugs", who the hell are you referring to?
Get more cream than all of you, nigga, fuck your team
Now Dre wants to change sides, the tricks are hidden in the war
Last year I shed tears, but I don't cry anymore
Also, Jay-Z tried to play with me, it won't last long
Go and ask the Sun King what it feels like to be gone
Listen Doo-Wop, don't drop, you can't win
Yeah nigga, all of you niggas can't fade this shit
And sold 5 million
I am a self-made millionaire!
Thug livin 'out of prison
Pistols in the air.
More than the Firm, more than Bad Boy, he kills Mobb Deep)
5 shots did not let me fall: I took it and smiled (3x)
(3rd time in parallel :) Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my A-K, I'm still the thug you love to hate (love hate, love hate)
First of all, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride come equipped with game
You say you're a gamer but I fucked your wife
Bust Bad Boys, niggas fucked up for life
Also, Puffy tries to see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some marked bitches
We keep on coming as we run for your jewelry
Constant shots, keep looking for them fools
You know the rules
Little Caesar, go ask yourself how I'm going to leave you.
Cut your young butt apart
Now be deceased
Little Kim, don't fuck with real G's
So fuck the peace
So let the Westside ride the night
Bad Boys killed in wax and killed
Fuck me and take off your caps
You know
Pawhoo hoo hoo hoo, live from the crazy house
I don't wanna be your man, bitch, (fuck) what are you crazy
I don't want to be your fucking man
I want to be ... let me fuck that nigga
What is that? Ayo, what are you doing with that big ass?
My ghetto love song (hahaha)

Can you help me multiply my stacks, baby
With that outrageous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
Look at my diamonds, bitch, they'll all blink
This is a thug, black outlaw with riches thing
Look at my resume, drinking Cristal and Alizé
Smokin 'on weed big keyed the Cali way
I don't like to cheat, but I'll buy you a fifth
I can't stand any diaper-headed bitch
Let my pedigree be read briefly, they are very cheap
Put busts made of bitches to sleep without penalty
Mash in my comp call, who is the man?
While I'm tugging on your head bitch head
Understand this: there is no nigger like me, fuck Jay-Z!
Let's be friends (Where are my niggas? Come on!)
As long as you bring me your friends

Let's be friends! (Where are the bitches?
Where the niggas with money? Where are you baby?
You don't have to be my man at all
Why are you fooling other hoes? Let's be friends
I met you and I stuttered with passion
Every time you pass you have me checking for you
Hardcore, watching and watching
Erotic, psychotic, would possess bubonic.
Everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweating like a fat girl going for mine
Just a skinny nigger fucking like he stole my mind
In the past I remember how it used to be
I guess money and fame got you used to it
What happens at 9-6? Good tricks in drag
Damn Dre! Tell that bitch she can kiss my ass!

Scream my name because baby it's delicious
Ghetto weak spot for pretty bitches
Up and down similar to switches
My move, honey, let your back slip inside
Make it fluid (fluid), inside and outside, all around when a nigga does it
I love it when you get upstairs baby let me ride!
Who wants to stop me? Am I first class?
Fuck the niggas who hate gamers cause they lock their dick
You probably hate seeing a real bully with vision, what's the game?
Instead of seeing a black man in jail, why are you changing?
He made a life of bad words, liquor and grass
It's the shit song, so check my record and let's be friends
Where are my niggas? Show me where my niggas are?
Where are my bitches Thug style!

Let's be friends, tell me where my bitches are
Let's be friends, tell me where my bitches are
Earn money, take money, be friends
You don't have to be my man at all
As long as you bring me your friends
As long as you bring me your friends
(Come on, put your cash!)
Why are you fooling other hoes? Let's be friends
Earn money, take money!
Earn money, take money!
Earn money, take money!
Earn money, take money!
Niggas ... fucking the wrong nigga
My seductive introduction be specific
And I'm still up; Blacks can't get to Mr. Wicked
Imagine me turning my opponents around, getting my cock quickly
Niggas is freaking out, but their styles miss me
Never personal business
I'm up before the sun comes up, I'm tired
Just a ghetto star, a double top R is what I'm ridding
Bring your artillery when you come for me, because we are sick thugs
I don't doubt when I threw and exploded, because Syke was bustin '
Also, Bo made them duck, yelling, "Get them in cash!"
So now I have the law on me
Tell them niggas this year when they pull the trigger
This is what you get
When you fuck with the wrong nigga
Hehehehe, yeah, nigga, take a look
Before I go to bed, I pray and I thank the Lord
For giving me another fruitful day
I wanna be a peaceful man, but even when the niggas come for me
All I can see is kill them
Really that's how i feel
Reflect my thoughts, flowing on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel; they stripped hats
We're still fine, but you played yourself
Give it the MAC and make it spray, hey
Putting two bullets in his dome, he wanted to die in the sky
Why call in shots? No one really as clear as me
I'm not trying to help the feds get a conspiracy case
Murder, my enemies are eliminated
We're all friends of death, so my real niggas show me love
God forgive me for my lifestyle, a negative figure
But why fuck with the wrong nigger
You know?
It's like ... why are you fucking with the wrong nigger?
I was raised by thugs, educated by murderers
I tried to get up, but they tried to
I guess they all had to die, cause we tried peace
I die in these streets
Explosion until they recognize
I still die or die, all my niggas get high, watch the time fly
The best strategy for profit
Better organize how you drive, so they can't stop you
So keep it poppin ', many busters wanna see me fall
I fucked your bitch, and now this new shit will fade them
My niggas ball, called for some backup
The little homies and my dogs in the black truck
"Buck Buck" was the sound when the doors burst
How do you imagine making moves in the wrong black
When you fuck with the wrong nigga
Niggas get hit, when they fuck with the wrong nigga
Fucking the wrong nigga
Punk police
Oh you too, nigga
Don't think we're not talking about your punk ass
You're a fake old nigger
Here we go
Turn it on, let it start
From block to block we snatch hearts
And jackin marks
You made me
Twisted Ass Beast Something Daisy
I have my mind ready
Looking down the canyon of my nine
Get up
Because it's time to make him pay
Done
Black
And don't accept substitutes
I bring the truth to youth
Tear off the roof of the entire school
Oh no i won't turn the other cheek
This is what we burned the other week -uh
Now we go with him in the explosion - explosion
How long will it take until the po 'get mo' in cash?
For my young black boys, BLAZE up
Life is a mess
Don't stress - try
Or give in
Much love to my brothas in the pen
See you when i set you free
Not when they push me
Thug for life
Stop until I die
Twisted Police Shootin
Letting it fly
Tell them
Thug for life
Twisted Police Shootin
Letting it fly
Tell them
Stop until I die
Letting it fly
Tell them
Thug for life
Stop until I die
Twisted Police Shootin
Clench your fists like this
Hello if you listen to me
Pump the pump if you are angry
For sold out tickets, live it
I guess because I'm black
I'm supposed to say "peace" sing songs and put myself on top
But it's time for a new plan: BAMN!
I'll be swinging like a klan man
Thug for life
Stop until I die
Twisted Police Shootin
Letting it fly
Tell them
Thug for life
Stop until I die
"The good thing is that we can show the human side of the police doing what they do
Because I've always believed that cops are just a gang, with the good and the bad
How I think street gangsters became good and bad like the police do
They got stressed out and had character flaws that stem from their lifestyles
Could be the best actor anyone has ever seen
Given the opportunity, the opportunity and the experience and the lessons of the people, it could be the best ...
But right now I don't want the best, I just want to be one of them
If you look at it from a stereotypical point of view, as people say, you know
'All your problems with the law, how can you play at being a police officer?'
Only from a stereotypical point of view
Who could better interpret a police officer?
I have seen them and their evil when they think that nobody is watching. I've seen compassion, I've seen anger, I've seen jealousy, I've seen fear, I've seen respect, and I've seen hatred by the police.
More than anyone, you know what I mean? I've been there. I just got out of the maximum prison
Who are you calling a rapist? Isn't that a bitch?
You demons are two faces
Do you want to see me locked in chains, ashamed?
And be harassed by these corrupt cops again
Fucking the young black man, trying to stack the bail
And, um, stay away from the crowded prisons
And that's why I had that .45 with one on camera
They try to say I don't care
I just woke up and yelled "To hell with the world!"
They try to say I don't care
Uhh, I woke up and yelled "To hell with the world!"
I got up and yelled "To hell with the world!"
When it was going wrong, you didn't even call it
Why i smoke blunt now and run with alcoholics
I'm flexing, coming from my enemies
And in their dreams it's hell where they send me
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Never take your eyes off the prize and even if you're getting high
Never hesitate to try
Because you can fall or stay playing, niggas, we are all
And they my motherfuckers calling
Fuck the world!
They try to say I don't care
I woke up yelled "Fuck the world!"
They try to say I don't care
I just woke up and yelled "To hell with the world!"
They try to say I don't care
I got up and yelled "To hell with the world!"
They're trying to say that I don't care
I woke up and shouted "To hell with the world!"
They're trying to say that I don't care
(Man, fuck the world)
Cause I'm sitting here drinking Guinness
Weighing 165 and these tricks should die
For being jealous of a brother when he gets up
I can see it in your eyes, you want to see a young beach fall
They hate to see a nigga dancing
Some of you fools are rotting, plotting what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him (Booyeah)
Stop giving free games, you want to hang out with me
How to be a bully is what it should be
But I got love for my friends, the G's and the macks
And if you're black, you better stay tied
They try to say I don't care
I woke up screaming "To hell with the world!"
They try to say I don't care
I woke up and shouted "To hell with the world!"
They try to say I don't care
I got up and yelled "To hell with the world!"
Haha, fuck the world!
Fuck off
I hear my niggas scream "Fuck the world"
They want to know if I claim the clique I'm hanging with
And if I'm depressed with this shit
Well buddy, I don't give a shit if you're Blood or Cuz
As long as you have love for thugs
But don't try to prove me, stop that
Homie, this is Thug Life's nigga and we're all tied up
Then go back to the corner where we sell crack
A straight son of a bitch who's not afraid to burst
They try to say I don't care
They try to say I don't care
I woke up screaming "Fuck the world!"
They try to say I don't care (They try to say I don't care)
I woke up and shouted "To hell with the world!" (Yes, what is going on?)
I don't care ... I don't care, I don't care!
(Introduction): 2pac
We take this to all the other level gutter bully style
You feel me, things we can only do as a true G
(Verse 1): 2pac
Hit me, I have my Hennessy find you enemies
In a room full of niggas trying to hide hoes
I'm on drugs with the Buddha because times are slow
I keep my mind on the dough, you'll never find me broken
And who me A black living life like a G
In that artillery, keeping the blacks away from me
I can't sleep living in these evil times, look
Niggas after me cause they see I'm stacking G's and heat
Can you scream if you want please!
I'm not running without punk bleeding!
Enemies and my rank is activated, you are in the danger zone
My fucking game is strong, now hotline
You better find your mind, I have mine
To my niggas in Quentin, Down on Rikers Island
Stay mad, but a nigga has to wear his styles
(Hook): 2pac
These niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, youthful, he was a troubled kid
Try to put me on the cross, but my strength was wild
These niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, youthful, he was a troubled kid
Try to put me on the cross, but my strength was wild
Niggas ass bitch don't know my style
(Verse 2): 2pac
I could be wrong but I never got along with the police
It's like the duck Makin 'niggas from Glocks got stuck
And all the time my mind is full of thoughts of ends
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
Because in the dark they see their hearts full of murder
My mom cried when they took me to jail
I heard some fools scream like the devil was inside
I'll drive them away in the morning, only the strong will survive
I cry, but in my own way I swallow my pride
Cemetery full of brothers I buried, it's falling
Even now I wonder if I'll still be around
My hometown is the gutter where I was born wild
I came out of this dust in my ruthless style
(Hook): 2pac
These niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, youthful, he was a troubled kid
Try to put me on the cross, but my strength was wild
Niggas ass bitch don't know my style
These niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, youthful, he was a troubled kid
Try to put me on the cross, but my strength was wild
Niggas ass bitch don't know my style
(Verse 3): Eazy-E
Aw yeah let's take a trip
Just sit down and light a joint with this and don't slip
On a funky-dope track, jump back
Tied up with a fat boot bag and a flak 7-8
Come clean, lean gangsta, I turned green
But I serve dubbing like it's not something I hang around with O.G. players don't organize the trip Or maybe you get what we call a pack of rats I don't slow down when it comes to the street Pateo real G funk to a Gangsta beat It's so sweet when you have money to spend I have a great prize tilt and a fabec benz
I make ends, I spend my mass, I am not an enemy
This is how it is, and this is how it goes
Giving love to the beaches that I know are true G's
(Hook): 2pac
Quick to smile, youthful, he was a troubled kid
Try to put me on the cross, but my strength was wild
(Verse 4): Eazy-E
Dump quickly into fools
And they have no cure for this disease
I get paid for the way I kick this
Like a G-ster, an OG-ster
And I live my life completely crazy
I don't need punk fools paying me
And I broke groupies and hootchies don't puzzle me
I take two steps back and free myself
To put platinum and gold on the record shelf
I don't brag, but I do it like it's straight
Before making a registration, partna, run your business and don't get caught sliding down
Or maybe you wonder (What about the ends, G?)
I call things by their name, and they pay me
G shows the way, so I give them love. That O.G.P.I.M PILMO, GILMO
Hip-hop thugsta, so fast to rush
Straight down to earth, fool, work
No one move, no one will be hurt
That's when it comes to me
Because I'm the shortest but fastest player name Eazy Women can't play me, some say I'm crazy
I don't care a trick without skank
Let me hit it once and gimmick, that's it
But don't stumble, don't give my mass to any enemy
This is how I have no love for you
These niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, youthful, he was a troubled kid
Try to put me on the cross, but my strength was wild
Blacks don't know my style
Quick to smile, youthful, he was a troubled kid
Try to put me on the cross, but my strength was wild
Niggas ass bitch don't know my style
Blacks don't know my style
Try to put me on the cross, but my strength was wild
Niggas ass bitch don't know my style
Blacks don't know my style
Quick to smile, youthful, he was a troubled kid
Try to put me on the cross, but my strength was wild
Niggas ass bitch don't know my style
Are you crazy about my damn hell being [laughs]
This thug shit, for life, I told everyone, it's album three, see?
G sound, freestyle
Damn young thugs in this motherfucker [laughs]
Dear Mama
I stole from my adversaries
But he slipped and left a witness
Or this black snitch
Or make the black rich?
But damn it, they caught me
Hawkin while I'm walking
And talking behind my back
I'm a little schizophrenic
I'm in this shit to win it
Here's my chance to spin it
To let the fools take me away
Niggas get jealous (jealous)
Peter picked up a pepper
But I can choose a punk
Caught him like a bitch
And threw it in the trunk
Punk thought it was a bluff
But I swear that I'm not nice at all
Before taking your life
I hear him scream
Had finally found his brain
New Rovers stop me
I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little bird
He sobbed and told a friend
It's a problem on my mind
I'm with the old men
They sentenced me to death
Today is my last day
I'm counting every breath
I'm bitter because I'm dying
So much that I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed
I have beef with a sick society
That doesn't give a shit
And they rushed to say goodbye
He's a scammer with a book
That motherfucker never mattered to me
He's only here to be sure
I don't give God a penny
About the crimes he is committing against the poor.
They are not my companions and in all these years
They never want me
It must be part of a great plan
To keep a nigga in the state pen
They caught you
You better get shot
I am convinced that self-defense is the way
Please stay tied, pack a gat every day
I wish I had known while I was there
Now I'm going straight to the chair
Dear Mama
Because I come from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me
I never told you that
Scared of what you could do
I couldn't hold you
I let him feed my anger
I'm sad for all my friends
Mercilessly for a stranger
It's 16 too
It is difficult to adapt
Instead of living sad in prison
I could have died free and happy
And my cellmate violated in the norm
And I went through the bedroom
You can hear his torn asshole
They made me an animal
I can't sleep, instead of counting sheep
Niggas counting cannibals
And so it is in the pen
And your soul is your best friend
Tell the Lord to make way for me
Get ready any day for me (why?)
Because when they come for me, they find a fighter
To death
The trick is to never lose hope.
I found my friend hanging dead on a rope
First there was nothing
Not even the faint echo of a song.
Loneliness was daily 4 yo
There was a sparkle of STARS in your eyes
I thought I would never feel like this again
But you were the only one that reached my heart
And find a friend in me
I couldn't ignore the magnetism
what I felt when you were close
And any trouble plaguing my mind
would suddenly disappear
It was the rebirth of my heart
The day you became my friend
Because I knew it from the moment
I held you I'd find love again
What time is it?
Shit, it's early nigga
It's like (damn it) ten o'clock
Fuck off
Ayo, I'm going to get some more of that shit
(coughing)
Yes, it is time!
Yes
Thug life nigga!
What time is it?
Ah yes, it's time to take my drink
It's time to have my drink
Yes it's time to take my drink
It's time to have my drink
Time to take my baby drink!
Yes it's time to take my drink
It's time to have my drink
Yes it's time to take my drink
It's time to have my drink
Yes it's time to take my drink
It's time to have my drink
Time to take my drink baby!
Time to have my drink, yes!
It's time to have my drink
Time to have my drink, yes!
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink, yeah
Time to have my drink baby!
It's time to have my drink
Yeah nigga
It's time to have my drink
Time to drink baby!
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink
Time to have my drink, yes!
Get my drink in black
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink
Time to take my baby drink!
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink
It's time to have my drink
Time to take my baby drink!
How are you living
Time to have my drink, yes!
Time to take my baby drink!
It's time to have my drink
Time to have my drink, yes!
Time to take my baby drink!
Is life worth living if I explode?
I'm tired of being poor and worse yet I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm looking for a purse to snatch away
Cops don't give a damn
Give the crack to the kids who care
A less hungry mouth on wellness
First send them drugs and let them deal with the brothers
Take a step back, watch them kill each other
Two shots in the dark now Huey is dead
Unless we share with each other
We have to start making changes
And this is how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother if he is near me?
I would love to come back when we play as children
But things changed, and that's the way it is.
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's the way it is
Aww yeah
I don't see changes, all I see are racist faces
Misplaced hatred dishonors the races
We wonder what it takes to do this.
A better place, let's erase the waste
Eliminate evil to the people with whom they will act correctly
‘Because both white and black are smoking crack tonight
And only when we relax is when we kill ourselves
It takes skill to be real, time to heal
And although it seems that heaven sent
We're not ready to see a black president, uhh
It's not a secret, don't hide the fact
The penitentiary is full and full of blacks.
Try to show another way but you stay in the drug game
Now tell me what a mother should do
Being real does not attract the brother in you
You have to operate the easy way
"I did a G today" But you did it in a bad way
Sell crack to the child. "They pay me"
Well well that's how it is
That's the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's the way it is
Aww yeah
That's the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's the way it is
Aww yeah
We have to make a change
It's time for us as people to start making some changes
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat ourselves
You see the old way didn't work, so it's up to us to do
What we have to do, to survive
And I still don't see changes, can't a brother have a little peace?
Then the police can bother me
And I never committed a crime that I don't have to do
But now I'm back with the niggas who give it back
Don't let them lift you up, back you up
You have to learn to hold on
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the police they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush, I blow this up
That's the sound of my tool, you say it's not great
My mom didn't raise a fool
And while I stay black I have to stay tied
"Because I always have to worry" about refunds
Some money I mistreated a long time ago
Coming back after all these years
That's the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's the way it is
Aww yeah
That's the way it is
Things will never be the same
That's the way it is
Aww yeah
Some things will never change
Uh, hit 'em with a little gospel ghetto
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome you with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
On the golden hills
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
I sit and remember, thinking of happiness and good morning
My heart is with them, they tried with the stress they had
And today things change
Everyone is ashamed of youth because the truth seems strange
And for me it is inverted
We leave you a world that is cursed and hurts
‘Because any day they will press the button
And all the good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Doesn't it make you cry? The world looks sad
There's no need for you to fear me
It is not black or white, because we are human
I hope we see the light before it is ruined; my ghetto gospel
Those who want to follow me
(Gospel of the ghetto)
I welcome you with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
On the golden hills
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
Tell me, do you see that old woman? It is not sad?
Living out of the bag but happy about the little things she has
And there, there is a lady, the crack drove her crazy
I don't stumble or let it fade away
From the frying pan we jump into another form of slavery
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, I took control, I took my own bottles
I make mistakes but I learn from everyone
And when it is said and done, I bet this brother will be better
If I bother you, don't stress
Never forget that God is not finished with me yet
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy?
Why did I choose to inflate a little and drink a beer with my friends?
Before finding world peace
We have to find peace and end the war on the streets.
My ghetto gospel
Those who want to follow me
(Yes, ghetto gospel)
I welcome you with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
On the golden hills
And peace to this young warrior
Lord can you hear me speak
To pay the price of being in hell
If I could remember before my bell days
I sat, I remembered thinking of a good morning bliss
I stop and look at the youngest
They proved that it was stress that
We never really went through that
Because we were born B.C. - you and me before the crack
Everyone is ashamed of youth because the truth seems strange
And for me it is inverted
We leave them a cursed world and that hurts
Because any day they will press the button
And everyone convicted like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Don't make them cry
The world looks sad
But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to listen to me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me up
It is not black or white because we are human
My ghetto gospel
(Chorus, Akon)
Who said this problem would stop today?
Many niggas get locked up
Teenage women growing up with AID
Ghetto
Ohh eating in the
Ghetto
Ohh sleeping in it
Ghetto
That's the life when you live in the
Ghetto
Ohh eating in the
Ghetto
Ohh sleeping in it
Tell me, do you see that old woman? It is not sad?
Living without bags, but she's happy for the little things she has
And there is a lady there, the crack drove her crazy, guess who is giving birth to a baby.
I don't stumble to let her fade away
And even now I get discouraged
I wonder if they'll get it all back. Will I continue to maintain courage?
I refuse to be a role model
And when it is said and done
I bet this brother will be better
If I bother you, don't stress, never forget that God is not finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain when I write rhymes, I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy?
Because I choose to inflate a little and drink a beer with my friends
Before finding world peace
We have to find peace, there is a war on the streets.
My ghetto gospel
Who said this problem would stop today?
Many niggas get locked up
Teenage women growing up with AID
Because that's the life when you live in it
Ghetto
Ohh eating in the
Ghetto
Ohh sleeping in it
Ghetto
That's the life when you live in the
Ghetto
Ohh eating in the
Ghetto
Ohh sleeping in it
Gun shot every night in the
Ghetto
Corrupt policemen sideways in the
Every day is a fight in the
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ghetto
I have children to feed in the
Ghetto
Sell coca and weed in the
Ghetto
Every day someone bleeds
Ghetto
Oh oh oh oh oh
Ghetto
If I could remember before my bell days
I would sit, remembering happiness on good morning
I stop and look at the youngest
My heart goes to them
They tested, it was emphasized that under
We never really went through that
Because we were born B.C. - you and me before the crack
And today things changed
Everyone is ashamed of youth because the truth seems strange
And for me it's the other way around
We leave you a world that is cursed and hurts
And all the good men like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Don't let me cry
The world looks sad
But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to listen to me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me up
I hope we see the light before it goes bankrupt
My ghetto gospel
(woman singing)
Okay, okay, okay
(2Pac over choir)
Yes my ghetto gospel
(Man talking)
(woman singing)
Okay, okay, okay
Tell me, do you see that old woman? It is not sad?
Livin 'out of bags but she's happy for the little things she has
And there is a lady there, the crack drove her crazy, I suppose she will give birth to a baby!
I don't stumble to let them fade away
From the frying pan we jump into another form of slavery
And even now I get discouraged
I wonder if they'll get it all back. Will I continue to maintain courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, I took control, I took my own bottle (yeah)
And when it is said and done
I bet this brother will be better
If I bother you, don't stress and never forget that God is not finished with me yet
But am I less holy?
I choose to inflate a little and have a beer with my friends
(and this is not world peace, we tried and failed) and there is war on the streets!
My ghetto gospel
I remember that Grandma's hands used to hug me, shape me, I never forget the things she told me
Brothers a butt and played the big shot because you know
Grandmothers are the only thing young children in the Ghetto have
Moms work and dad is buried
She dropped me on grandma's house
Bless her heart because she cares
And the ghetto grandmothers are like books, we have so many criminals because so many grandmothers shudder
And fall into the nursing home
And times are hard and even worse just
And how can you be so cold?
You will have your turn as soon as you get old
Everything they ask of each person
Because everyone needs a little help to trust themselves
My ghetto gospel
I was a stone cold gangsta man
Until you gave me the ghetto gospel, I appreciate it.
Now I'm hitting these tracks, slandering the rhymes I got
In this world of greed trying to succeed in my beliefs
Now i lie down to sleep
Can you forgive me for my sins?
If I had to do it all over again I would still play to win
I hope the Lord can understand me
A man has to do what he can for his family
And pay the price of being in hell
But I'd rather see hell later than see hell now
And the devil has nothing on the president, cut down and keep us tied up in our residence and be like animals in cages
We can rant about slavery for centuries
Or we can start doing something positive and hit them with a little ghetto gospel
My ghetto gospel
(my ghetto gospel)
Okay, okay, okay
(my ghetto gospel)
Okay, okay, okay
(my ghetto gospel)
(it disappears)
Haha
To all my niggas in the neighborhood (yeah!)
Living the life of a ghetto star
(you know) You know how we do it hahaha
Just holla my name and official witness of the game
Niggas so embarrassed they stiffen like scared bitches
Although they promised me shots, when am I going to stop?
Witness the death of my enemies when I pass
They shouldn't have tried me
I send their bodies to their parents up north
With their faces, their wrists, and their chopped nuts
Fuck everything I scream while I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, make me rich and the bitches will come
Break my weapon, make them disperse
The bullets to my nuts only made my balls fat
Eat a dick, mercy biyotch, never that, you say you will come back?
Go ahead, always tied
Present you the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
I live the life of a black thug, drug dealer who lives the tight game
Mug niggas, slug niggas for life of fame
Quick for slang, and let it rain through your brain
Movin 'niggas with telekinesis
Keeping Channel 7 at work, filming different features
Leading niggas to a premature death with their heads blown
And for those who didn't make it to the morgue, he was dead and missing
And I hope that blacks are punished
Kidnapped, trapped in the back with MAC's up to their necks, rappers wait to finish
Behind him we kick his ass
I imprinted my name on these streets like a damn G
Now the next generation is looking at me like Cedric told them [?]
Walking through the cemetery, talking to my friends who were buried
See my enemies, I want to see me dead, I'm not worried, forgive me
Please give me shelter, calm my fears
I see bodies splashed with acid
Two shots rang out from the plastic Glock, wrapped in plastic
Buried the bastard, time to notify
Evacuate the crime scene fast
Fly, I won't touch land until I see Tijuana
Set up a store selling marijuana to corrupt cops
Retired from life that never gave me shit
But cash I couldn't spend, countless cars
I have news that some nerds want to plan this
Born soldier, fucked with a MAC-fo
Because I have, slugs, to get the air out of your chest
Death, apparently they were not free of suction
Because I had all those would-be black thugs in protective custody
I thought I was a nerd until I hit one of them on the sidewalk
With a team and a clientele on my damn cock
By giving points, life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I want to be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I want to be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I want to be like them
When I grow up I want to be like them
And live my life like a ghetto star
When I grow up I want to be like them
Live my life like a ghetto star
When I grow up I want to be like them
And live my life like a ghetto star
This goes to all you motherfuckers (to all you motherfuckers)
That STILL, I have to kill to earn that money (still, I'm going to leave it)
You all niggas on the block, selling rocks
Hand in hand, running away from the police (selling damn drugs)
(smoking weed)
I see you
Live your life like a ghetto star
(look at these hobo hoes) Talk to the hood
Claiming riches
Running away from the new enemies of the beach. (any fake ass niggas)
Live my life like a ghetto star
(this is still 70 south)
Niggas with two shots that don't want to see the third (nah), I feel you
It's Don Makaveli: live my life like a ghetto star
The only way for me to return is through Makaveli
That's! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm taking back what's mine
Motherfuckers can't stop me (laughs)
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black ... ghosts
Feel me?
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
He used to find drugs in his coat
And he almost drowns when he tells me not to smoke
My mom smoked a lot
When I was pregnant, I am surprised that she is not late
At night I can't sleep, I count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors, five deep
Starin on the wall, I heard a scream
Wake up in the morning
Look at the blood in the hallway at the crime scene.
Take a breath of the forceful and watch the smoke swirl
My mossberg turns BOOM, what is another plug?
(WAIVER NIGGA) Don't be out of breath
Every step could be death until you explode
And be the last nigga left then I'll be a ghost
Don't cry, just ask why and try not to die
As I take you through the lullaby of a ghetto nigga
As I take you through the lullaby of a ghetto nigga
I thought I was stumbling the second time they rolled, for
Don't kill me, kill me, kill a nigga while sleeping
Let me die while I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggas in the Seven Deuce
Run to protect yourself and return fire
DIE MOTHER FUCKIN DIES, I hope her ass gets fried, don't ask why
But I left everything I have
An empty clip hit the ground like a black blow
On my ass was the damn police now
Barely breathing trying to avoid being knocked down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet buzzed by
Still running like a nigga has nine lives
I don't know why but I'm running to my damn block
He shot, tired of running away from the niggas and the police.
Time to be a ghost
(Hey man, let's go fuck yourself)
Don't cry, just ask why and try not to die
it's time
check it out
Yes bow down
Yes yes bow down
Yes yes bow down
Just rolling (come on)
Just rolling (Ayy, what are you doing?)
Just rolling (Ayy nigga, what are you doing?)
With so much drama on the L-B-C
It's kind of hard being Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, somehow
Keep coming up with funky shit, like, every day
Can I kick something for the G's?
And do some extremes as I make my way?
‘Because my mom is not home
Then what do you want to do?
Turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) We don't love them hoes, yeah
So let's smoke an ounce of this (Sing that shit!)
G is up, hoe, while you motherfuckers bounce off this
Just rolling!
Just rolling!
Just rolling!
And my money on my mind
Just rolling!
Just rolling!
Just rolling!
Relaxed, with my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Now that I have some Seagram gin
Everyone has their cups, but they haven't been chopped
You gotta get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listen to the D-O-G
I have the cultivation music that will captivate him
Who listens to the words I speak
While I take a drink in the middle of the street
And get mackin 'to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the little lady of my nigga (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I say to that bitch please
At ease, while I move with the pound Dogg
Feel the breeze, because I'm just ...
Just rolling!
Just rolling!
And my money on my mind
Just rolling!
Relaxed, with my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Later that day, my friend Dr. Dre
He came with a gang from Tanqueray
And a fat ass J from some chronic bubonic
That made me drown, shit, this is no joke
I had to go back and sit my cup
But there's no stopping, cause I'm still exploding
Dre got some bitches from Compton town
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
‘Because when I pass, I have to go to the drug scene
I don't love you hoes I'm out the door and I'll be
Just rolling!
Just rolling!
Relaxed, with my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Just rolling!
Just rolling!
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
(Death row)
Say "Dogg's Pound"
Say "Dogg's Pound"
(Dogg's Pound)
Say "Snoop Dogg"
(Snoop Dogg)
(Snoop Dogg)
Say "gin and juice"
(Gin and juice)
Say "gin and juice"
(Gin and juice)
Yes
Nothing but a gangsta
No, nothing, but a gansta (Say what, say what)
No, no, nothing, but a gangster (Say what, say what)
No, no, nothing, but a gangster (all of you)
No, no, nothing, but a gangster
No, no, nothing, but a gansta (Baby!)
No, no, nothing, but a gangster
No, no, nothing, but a gansta (Party!)
I represent all of you to the fullest
You know that we are representing for all of you
We take it to another level
Nigga shot me five times
I got out of jail and sold five million
Niggas can't fuck with us
That fat shit only sold two million
I had half of New York rapping that shit
That's the death row style, west side
That peace shit, I'm not even trying to make amends, fuck them all
The beaches are on this side.
That nigga tried to play that gangsta shit, but we M-O-B for fucking real
Then they will make a song called "LA, LA"
Niggas don't know, they gang bang in LA, they love to fight
(Killing and shooting)
Stupid fucks (motherfuckers)
That's why we drop it like we drop it
So don't you think a nigga is going crazy
We will only try to represent it for all of you to the fullest
When they tell us something, we want to make sure to pound their ass
Like we did to Biggie, look at that quiet nigga like a damn church mouse
He fell down, hit him, that black shitless
His pregnant wife, that nigga waiting like a waiting father
Without knowing who the baby is (Ha ha ha)
The world doesn't know that I use rubber, so it's not mine
Tell you directly
I didn't want to fuck that fat bitch in any way (just out of spite)
But you know, that's the secret of war.
He is my enemy, so she looked good
Then they tried to put my nigga in a murder case and just lock his butt forever
Like it's the season to kill a nigga
However, Snoop went crazy, they got out not guilty
We'll drop your shit in a couple months
So make some noise for Snoop, definitely running for president
(The gangsta party)
Give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC
Give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC, give me an ACC
I was like woah, this nigga must be fucking fucked in the ass
Because he gave him ecks, the bill is because that nigger has to go ask for a bill that had a weird name, and this black man, this black name that I want to fuck with Outlawz, black is his West Side until he dies I'll screw you up like the 9/11 nigga, Carton, this ain't a mistake, it's just a fucking message, if you don't listen then give me an ACC
Cardboard, man, I'm just trying to be a friend, but
Man fuck all the niggas, just give me a bill, and besides that gives me nitro
God
I asked a friend to help me endure the pain
No one came except God
When I needed a breath to get up, from my dream
When all I saw was sadness, and I needed answers
No one heard me except God.
I'm not looking for another name except God
That's right, bwoy, it's happening right here
Thug Life, God bless the dead
God bless the dead and buried, nigga don't worry
If you see God first, tell him that things got worse
I'm not mad, I know you represent the crew
And I can imagine you in heaven with a blunt and a beer
Fuck the world, pain was part of the game
If you are a baller, the money was as fast as it came
My role models disappeared or locked in the pen
Straight hustlers caught in the whirlwind
We all have hoods and all we had were dreams
In the gutter you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to trying, I never wanted to do time
My epitaph will read "It was the last of G"
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless death
God bless death
God bless death
Since I was a little motherfucker who wanted to hang up
Memories of my nigga but he's dead now
Looking back on my yearbook
Every year they took half of my companions, they stretched for years
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me clear my head
Behind me, life without my 9, I'd rather make time
And why the hell am I locked up in jail?
They were released, white boys, we were astonished as hell
In my mind I can see it coming
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga running
I keep a gun and never run unless I come to you
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless death
God bless death
Rest in peace with all the motherfuckers who died too soon.
Real fuck, this is for you
Yo Big, this is for you, my nigga
Springfield Hollis Crew, Thug Life, YG'z
Sending respect, you know what I mean?
You are my black for life, forever
You will always be with a nigga
No matter what, don't forget it!
I pray before I go to sleep, "OMG!"
Say my grace before I start eating, because times are hard
So I get down on my knees, "Oh why!"
Niggas terrified by the drama of the young weapon
Hearing they did it out of fear, don't surprise me
But it's amazing, so I'm going crazy
He slipped, forgot the gun, but didn't run like a punk
You should have the meter in the trunk
But spunk is what I had, boy, I'd rather attack Big
Now you're about to smell the consequences of what the mag did
I want to suck you want to try, I tell you yes
Teflon is about to rip your fucking vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quickly
The Biggy Smallz spirit and the thug clique, yeah
God bless death
God bless death
God bless death
Interlude:
You must understand that when I was having a gun and being on the street, my mother left him to be at home and do the dishes and feed us and put the thoughts in our brains. Because we didn't get any of that story from any of those soldiers we lost, we didn't get any of it. They all went to jail, if you can remember. They all went to jails
Verse 01 2Pac:
Calling all fake rap stars and dogs
Uh
Because I am convinced that my squad is real
I have a mind full of murderous thoughts
When unleashed
I make niggas bow
Sit me down now or be deceased
I'm not choosing sides
Hell no
It's Westside when I go to see 4 corpses
The letters are colorful words and anesthetics
Problems resolve faster than calisthenics exercises
I'm bulletproof
Let's get to work on a complete AK, what plan do you have to do?
It's West Coast nigga fuck New York
Now everyone heard me?
You shot my friends now, I'm a blast
Screamin 'Thug Life muthafucka when I pass
Hook:
NY '87
NY '87
NY '87
NY '87
The dance floor is dangerous
Packed like a briefcase
Rhythm with rough rhyme ral
Rhythms with deep bass
Girls in tight pants
Maybe they can dance
The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s motives they are neutral
Now that you're here, let me introduce you
Get prepared
I am hard to read like graffiti but constant
The science I drop is too heavy
The recipe is one every hour
You need another hit from the freestyle fan
Attention: follow the instructions very closely
Keep out of the reach of children
Too many milligrams
NO ONE made an iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kills a man
Ideas to make the ear afraid
I could divide
Will never forget it
At least when he leaves, he'll know what hit
The last breath of the words of death
NY '87
2 your name is only poetry
I hardly know you and now
I can't explain this feeling that I feel
April 4
I want 2 c u from the moment
My cold indifferent heart finally only has eyes
April 4
So now I risk it all
I accept the ridiculous
in exchange for the words you share with me
All this and much more I will
April 4
The border postcard was driving me crazy
So I get up on my cruise, I got off the platform
I rolled over to the West Side to see my boys
Twenty brothers in the park, all bring the noise
I got out of the car, Levi sank
I pray around my neck with my limb walking delay
I walked my boys with the old E chillin '
The box with the great rhythms and my children started to get sick
A hoop game started, so I jump
Outside said, 2Pac above center
A ten minute game and we were the winners.
The boys started hitting, talking about that slack and
Until I see my gang and the fools started backing down
Another light fool who can't handle defeat
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It is not to understand, it is only one day in life
(2Pac)
I'm finally on vacation and school is over
So here I am, Monday morning with nothing to do
So there I stayed, for half the day just thinking
But I was alone, so it was nothing
I got up to shower and heard the phone ring
I picked it up, greetings, a little frustration.
Who could disturb me on my vacation?
Talking on the phone in an aggravating tone
Now I know what Michael meant by leaving me alone
It was the voice of my friend Roc-T.
I had a show at three and now I'm late as can be
I said I have to take a shower, I'll go and take it
If I leave in an hour, I could still do it
I'm rolling in a sweater, I wasn't trying to get cute
He jumped on stage and said "I'm sorry I saved you"
I couldn't wait to finish so I could start mackin '
He jumped off the stage, picked up the girl for the night
Huh, that's how I'm living, one day in life, come on
one day in the Life
(Ray Tyson)
Stretching white limousine hits the coliseum
A crowd full of people saying "I can't wait to see them"
Who's in the limo, who are they talking about?
Strictly dope in the house, here to turn off the party
We get out of the car and we can hardly bear
Because wherever I look they are fans screaming
They'll rip my new clothes if your bodyguards leave them
Hit backstage with two minutes to spare
Just long enough to breathe fresh air
I went on stage and then I moved the crowd
Winners everywhere, we try to leave the scene
Pen and paper on my face, it couldn't be bad
So I signed autographs at the age of seventeen
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It is not difficult to understand, it is only one day in life.
Kick it - it's a day in the life
Kick it kick it kick it
(2Pac)
Coolin 'with my group at the neighborhood disco
Talking to a girl while I'm drinking on my cisco
Asking me to dance but I keep saying "No"
I hate dancing fast, I just like to slow it down
Dizziness on the dance floor, funky, funky movement
The girl keeps sweating me with sexual things
Strictly Dope is positive, we are trying to stop the violence.
I started to feel drunk, I'm looking for the door
Cisco made me dizzy, I fell to the ground
My stomach starts to spin and my head feels resourceful
The room starts spinning, I pass out at night
(Ray Tyson and 2Pac)
I knew I was a genius, as soon as you saw this
Avoid the value of ho, you don't have to redeem this
Teen terror, no margin for error
Risin 'like inflation on your favorite season
My mother did not want it to be, but I am a master of ceremonies
That is why many hate me and call me a liar.
Bass Drum Hoods, Girls on the Bad Trip
I'm done rocking this hit, so that's it
I'm the tall type, my style is very correct
and your soul was in the wind
It was at this uncomfortable moment
that you and I become friends
and you discovered celibacy
and our bond was a memory
And now I see you feel it
that bond that we made before
and never again
To my niggas who got out in the service line
21 pistol salute! A love, a bully, a nation.
(Let's go down, let's do this!)
21 pistol salute! (Come on, yes, let's do this!)
21 pistol salute! (Come on, come on, let's do this!)
All the time I'll be ...
Hoping my real motherfuckers know
Against all odds, up in the studio, exploding
To the truest shit I ever spoke
I just appeared in the crowd, all you saw were troops
This little black man named Nas thinks he lives like me
Speaking of who got out of the hospital, he took five like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I refuse your deposit
Mobb Deep wonders why a nigga blew them
The next time adult people talk, nigga shut up!
Look at me, I take this war shit deep
Fact seen many real players fall
To let these niggas bitch hit me
Puffy, let's be honest: are you a punk or will you see me wearing gloves?
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me being a bully?
And you can tell people that you do what you want
But you and I know what's going on
Retribution, I knew you bitch niggas a long time ago
Witness me tied up with MAC, I knew I wouldn't play that
You all old rappers trying to move on
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas look like Larry Holmes (check out De La Soul!)
Flabby and sick
Trying to make the player hate my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known, that's how you made me
Against all odds I hope my motherfuckers know
This is the most real shit I've ever written
Against all odds, in the studio, blowing
To the truest shit I ever spoke
This is the most real shit I've ever written
I heard he was light skinned, stocky, with a Haitian accent
Jewelry, fast cars and is known for flashing
A true live story about a snitch named Haitian Jack
I knew I was working for the feds
Same crime, different lawsuits, nigga, imagine what he said
And did I mention it?
Promised to pay, Jimmy Henchman, in due course
I know niggas bitch is listening, the world is mine
Get me wet, niggas got me
Play the game, nigga; all war, an eye for an eye
Now you have to take care of your back, now look at your forehead
Here we go, shots at Tut, now you stayed
Fuck the rap game, nigga, this M.O.B
So believe me, we enemies, I go through thick and thin
I hope my real motherfuckers know
This is the most real shit I've ever written
Against all odds, in the studio, blowing
To the truest shit I ever spoke
I hope my real motherfuckers know
This is the most real shit I've ever written; Against all odds
Puffy stolen like a bitch, to hide that fact
And that nigga who was depressed for me, staying dead
They switched sides, I guess his new friends wanted him dead
I'm probably killed for the shit I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathing or dead
Lord, listen to me, God doesn't like ugly, it was written
You heard my tune (This nigga sounds like Rakim!)
Now you want to live my life
So what is a "chazzer", Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme well
You've seen too many movies
Hang 'em up against the wall, close your eyes
Since you lie, you die, bye!
Let the real niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you were me? Nigga
Hoping my real motherfuckers know
This is the most real shit I've ever written
Against all odds, up in the studio, exploding
Against all odds I hope my real motherfuckers know
This is the most real shit I've ever written
Against all odds, up in the studio, exploding
To the truest shit I've ever spoken; Against all odds
21 gun salute, a love to my real niggas thugs
(Out of the law! Out of the law! Out of the law!)
21 gun salute to my niggas dying in the line of duty
Who play the rules of the game, salute 21 weapons
I greet you, my niggas, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all of you niggas made by bitches, I'm coming for you
Through thick and thin, I don't care who the hell you are
You touch me, I'm with you
I know motherfuckers didn't think I forgot
Hell no I don't forget nigga
You said don't go to war unless I have my money right
I have my money now, now I want war
Influenced by crime, addicted to grinding
Concerned with my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I've been dancing since my teens constantly climbing
Man, motherfuckers, you don't know there's no time
That's right, that's right boy, start that shit
I heard a rumor that I died, dramatized in cold blood
But that was fiction, a coward made the story go wrong
As if it no longer exists, mysteriously missing
Although I'm global, baby, it's not hard to find
Where I spend most of my time, my California routine
Watching for thieves, I'm cautious, it's like I barely breathe
Putting a bullet in motherfuckers, give me a reason
You tried to play with me, now murder is my only payment
I'm addicted to the coin in this life that I lead
Why the hell are you running, you cowards, too scared to fight a G?
For the life of me, I can't see
How motherfuckers imagine life after a night of fucking with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Influenced by crime, addicted to grinding
Concerned with my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I've been dancing since my teens constantly climbing
Motherfuckers don't know a thing about not timin '
I have my locs on, helmet, going to war
Breaking them in sight, stopping lives like red lights
And get to shoot in the ass like the last outlaw
Rich, 2Pac and The Click, smokin 'blunts, loading clips
With enough shit to raise your block at once
We bring horror as Tales From the Crypt
And it's not hard to find the stories we kick
I'm fully automatic, full of static and shit
I'm riding a shotgun with the dye on my back
I'm planning on having a fucking mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where selling narcotics is all I know
I have blow, speed and grass, whatever is nice
And if you need a motherfucker, it's not hard to find
That's while I keep grinding (it's true)
To the point where a black can't stop
Too much feeling this shit, that's why I'm quick to skin a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass has to go
I serve blow for blow, and motherfuckers keep falling
Influenced by crime, addicted to grinding
Concerned with my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I've been dancing since my teens constantly climbing
Man, motherfuckers, you don't know there's no time
C-Bo, D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
Da Bay, beitch!
Down the steps
Abandoned apartment complex
The heavy metal weapons they carry cannot be scary
Best smoothie and baked all the niggas in I-was-finest-to-ass
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I-was-gon'-do-somethin'-niggas
Threatens your life, it's not like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head, fuck him, have him
(Watch this)
I grew up with that nigga
He threw up with that nigga
I heard he was trying to ride
Double agent for the other side
Keep my name out of your dentist, nigga
Over twenty points, you behave like those bitches
Side by side
Check the resident, it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find
What are we missing? Don't you know what we are missing?
What are we missing?
Pooh, hit them on the head
Yes Yes
(Give up, it's a party for this motherfucker)
(It's a party at this motherfucker)
It's a party all of you
Shake your hands from side to side, come on
To the left, to the right
Shake your hands from side to side
When I met you last night, baby
Before opening your gap
But now I get it all back
(Because you're a cheating bitch)
And you even licked my balls
And I promise you baby, I'll call you (maybe)
Next time I feel a little horny (Biatch)
You can come (you know, you know)
And I'll interrupt you (All, all, come on)
And if you can't fuck that day baby (Sing that shit)
Just lie down and open your mouth
(They throw them up, throw them up, it's not fun if my friends can't have any, throw up)
That i love all over the world
(Oh shit, Kurupt the king)
Well if Kurupt cared about a bitch, he would always be broke
I'd never have a motherfucker (Indo for smoking)
They drive me crazy and crazy
Bitch, you can't make me
Do we look alike BBD, hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
Thats something I learned at Tha Pound
To pay this just to put this ho
I know the pussy is mine
So I'm going to fuck a few more times
And then I'm done
There is nothing more to do with it.
Pass it to the friend, now you hit it
And you know that bitches ain't shit to me
I don't give a shit
Approach her with a different proposal
I'm Kurupt hoe
You'll never be my only bitch trick
(Come on, everyone sings that shit)
(Up, it doesn't stop)
It's not fun if friends can't have any
(Come on, sing that shit)
It's not fun if friends can't have any
Guess who back in the fucking house
Hoes recognize, niggas too
What are you going to do?
You really don't know
Silly of me to fall in love with a bitch
Knowing very well, I'm too caught up in my grip
Now as the sun turns and my game gets bigger
How many bitches want to fuck this black called Snoop?
Puppy, I'm all of the above
I'm too fast to catch up on your hoes
If my friends can't prove it
Uh uh
I just don't love him man
Something to keep your confidence
Hey, this is going out with Mu's grandmother
Definitely dating Mu's grandmother
A love, rest in peace, let the angels take you away
One Love
There's nothing wrong with a black man getting his papers
Don't hate us, listen to the song
I'm still waiting for the world to come save us
How they made us, every time it's on
It doesn't matter who did it, they blame us, they hate us
They hate us
There's nothing wrong with a black man getting his papers
Don't hate us, listen to the song
I'm still waiting for the world to come save us
How they made us, every time it's on
It doesn't matter who did it, they blame us, they hate us
It has to be strong, no matter what they do, they can't break us
Because they hate us
The verse continues to repeat itself throughout the song.
Can we pretend that planes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
I wish now, I wish now
Can we pretend that planes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
I wish now, I wish now
There is never a good day
My friends die before they can see their birthdays
Sometimes it hurts to pray
And every Halloween
Look at the crime scene
I can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
Sometimes I look for evidence
I wonder if heaven has a ghetto
And if it does
And now what do I do?
These things a thug goes through
And still I get up
So keep your head up
Pain in my heart, I was desperate from the start
So keep your head up
And make your mind strong
It's a fight every day ...
I could really use a wish right now
I wish now, I wish now
Can we pretend that planes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I wish now, I wish now
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to rest
So much pressure in this life of mine
Sometimes I cry, once I contemplated suicide
And I would have tried, but when I held that 9
Imagine me in the misery of poverty
No living man has witnessed the struggles I survived
No one knows my fight, they only see the problem
Not knowing that it's hard to go on when nobody loves you
Praying hard for better days, promise to hold on
We found a familiar place to kick it
Where can we drink liquor and nobody argue about shit tricks
A place where we can smoke in peace.
We still visualize places that we can shoot in peace.
I have a place for all of us so we can dance, in the bully's mansion
Can we pretend that planes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
I wish now, I wish now
I wish now, I wish now
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone, they're just memories
Suppose Marshall Mathers never took a pen
Pretend it was postponed, had no motivation
Imagine you just made up excuses that were paper thin
They could fly with the wind
"Marshall you will never make it
He pretends he stayed out all day
And he played with his friends
Imagine he even had a friend to say he was his friend
And it wasn't time to move
And the schools were not changing again
It wasn't socially awkward and just weird when I was a kid
And never dreamed that I could destroy stadiums
And I just wander like shit
"You don't mean shit, stop daydreaming, boy!
You need to have your skull checked
You're thinking like an alien, it's just not realistic. "
Now pretend they don't just make you mad at this shit
And there was no one I could point to when I was angry
And his alarm went off to wake him up
But he did not make it to the Rap Olympics.
I slept in his plane and he lost it
You will have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC crap
But it didn't fall into his lap
So he's not even here, pretend ...
I could really use a wish right now
Can we pretend that planes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I wish now, I wish now
Wait for me black as you wait for Jesus to return
Wait for me black! I'm going'!
Haha, for the bitches who think it's all about you (It's about you) (This Dru Down in the house
With my son 'Pizznac, do you know what I'm saying?)
It's about you (Yes, I'm going to say that it's about you
But you know I'm lying, ha! Yes)
I want to laugh about how I got my butt
Caught with this bad bitch?
Thinking I had her, but she had me in the long run
You could be rolling with a thug
Instead, with this faint thicket, looking for some love
In every club, I see you like you want
I'm still drunk from last night
Hitting these walls as I stop, addicted to the fast life
I try holla, but you tell me what you took
Saying you're not impressed with the money I'm making
Fresh out of jail, life is hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I'm calling, and maybe you with that
Fantasies of us kissing, can I hit him?
Addicted to the things you do
But still what I say is true, boo, because this is about you
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
Yeah nigga
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
I promise that if you go with me, just let me know
I'll make you scream my name before I go
No one loves me, I'm a black thug
I only dated criminals and drug dealers
Witness me holla on a hoochie, look how fast the game takes
How can I tell him that I am a beach and that I don't even care?
Crawl low, the grass smoke is in the air
Wherever you go, it's all about the groupie hoes
I could never put a bitch in front of my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and watch the drama I'm going through
It's all about you
Every other city we go to, any other video
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
Are you sick with your cock or is it the flu?
It's not about you or your team of bitches
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shit.
Do you think it's all about you? Well boo
A lyrical attack, perhaps, was a visual bluff
When I started taking photos, all your walks were mounted
Gold digging, cold digging of a gold Rolex
I slide easily, try a brown bear
The bitches know the cut, I came to fuck, tried to hit me
Running on you like Bruce Jenner when I bend you
At most, I caught a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
Every other city we go to, any other video
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
I'm telling you, it's the same old shit
I mean, damn it, you know what I say?
I'm sitting back, watching the video of Montell Jordan
I see the same bitch that was in my Nate Dogg video.
Then I flip the channel, I'm reviewing my Homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what I'm saying? And then, do you know what I say?
What makes that even more screwed up?
I'm watching a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch in Million Man March
That was in the Warren G home video!
I mean, damn it, wherever I look, wherever I go
I see the same ho
Don't be mad, I'm only real, yeah
So I'm a little tired
I'm not going to rehearse this shit
So we do it all live
Hi Suge, what am I going to do when I get out of jail? I was going to start digging into these niggas checks, right? And quickly, let me see your binoculars. The binoculars
Come on yeah
It's about you once
It's all about you
Go up up!
It's all about you
I want to laugh about how I got my butt
Caught with this bad bitch?
Thinking I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm caught with the wrong fucking
Scandalous times, this game is like my religion
You could be rolling with a thug
Instead, with this faint thicket, you're looking for some love
In every club, I see you watching how you want it
Let the liquor help you up
I'm still drunk from last night
Hitting these walls as I stop, addicted to the fast life
I try holla, but you tell me what you took
Saying you're not impressed with the money I'm making
I guess what they tell me is true
So that's the reason why I'm calling, and maybe you with that
Fantasies of us fucking, can I understand it?
Addicted to the things you do
But still what I say is true, boo, because this is about you
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
Yeah nigga
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
I promise that if you go with me, just let me know
No one loves me, I'm a black thug
I love black people because we come from the same place
Witness me holla on a hoochie, look how fast the game takes
How can I tell him that I am a beach and that I don't even care?
Waiting niggas at the end of every show
I just saw you in my friend's video
Now I never put a bitch in front of my friends, so here we go
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
It's not about you or your team of bitches
Every other city we go to and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shit.
You couldn't stop me, I'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, was a visual bluff
When I started taking photos, all your walks were mounted
Directly in control, flows will double, while hoes take a cold ride
Hold on the set, I said to Dramacy 'come in later
I slide easily, try a brown bear
The bitches know the cut, I came to fuck, tried to hit me
Running on you like Bruce Jenner when I bend you
At most, I caught a bitch from the west coast to West Virginia
Uh uh
It's like this
It's all about you
Where "How do you want it" in me?
How do you want it?
Where that strange shit?
How does it feel
our paths crossed and they met
it would be difficult 2 4get
but you reeked of sensual confidence
I couldn't wait 2 lips caresses
when we did it was what i expected
and 4 at that moment we erase the tension
from the discomfort of the concerns of the first date
We kissed again and I felt the passion
Change? Shit
I guess change is good for any of us.
(Come on) Yes!
Where are my ladies? Where are my ladies
It's all about you
(Go up up)
Light that shit, man!
(Fuck that shit!)
Not the microphone!
You probably twisted like the last trick
I want to laugh about how I got my butt
Caught with this bad bitch?
Wise decisions, based on lies we live
Scandalous times, this game is like my religion
You could be rolling with a thug
Instead, with this faint thicket, looking for some love
Let the liquor help you up
I'm still drunk from last night
Hitting these walls as I stop, addicted to the fast life
Saying you're not impressed with the money I'm making
I guess what they tell me is true
Fresh out of jail, life is hell for a black celebrity
Well that's the reason why I'm calling, and maybe you with that
Fantasies of us kissing, can I kick it?
Addicted to the things you do
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
Come on g
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
No one loves me, I'm a black thug
I only dated criminals and drug dealers
I love black people because we come from the same place
How can I tell him that I am a beach and that I don't even care?
Waiting niggas at the end of every show

Now I don't put a bitch in front of my friends, so here we go

It's all about you
You, you, you, you
And you and you
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same thing ho
(This for some of the niggas too)
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
You couldn't stop me, I'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, was a visual bluff
When I started taking photos, all your walks were mounted
Directly in control, flows will double, while hoes take a cold ride

With my son 'Pizznac, do you know what I'm saying?)
It's all about you
(Yes, I'm going to say that it's all about you
But you know I'm lying, ha! Yes)
I want to laugh at how he caught my ass
With this bad bitch?
Thinking I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm caught with the wrong fucking
Scandalous times, this game is like my religion
You could be rolling with a thug

Fantasies of us sweating, can I hit him?
But still what I say is true, boo, because this is about you
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you

It's about you, yeah, nigga, it's about you
Every other city we go to, any other video
It's all about you
Every other city we go to, any other video
No matter where I go, I see the same
I see you walking in your miniskirt
A crooked smile with a heart that messed up a lot
Will it work with your butt when you pass me?
Saying "hey", I've been watching you smile all day, let's enjoy
As I keep working on your zipper, my tongue kissing
In your position I am fortified to do the mission
Move your hips and ride this
Too many cooks in the kitchen, no one takes the time to listen
They probably think we're still distinguishing
With your permission, I can make you scream my name
I'm a real man, I guide you through the sordid game
Follow me, let me take you to ecstasy
You will have the best time of your life when you are by my side, you will see
There's no way they can stop me
When I know that a real hooligan woman caught me
It's all about you
Big Syke, Newt, Hank, Beauregard, Big Sur (yes)
Everyone knows how this shit goes (you know)
All eyes on me
Roll up in the club and shit, right?
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
But you know what?
Many niggas who hate gamers try to sound like us
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And may these demons repent for the day they finally set me free
Hitting motherfuckers when we pass
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, because even when I'm high
Cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-0 Benz, flaunting striking rings
Uhh, bitches chase me like a dream
It is known to disappear before your eyes like a drug demon
It seems that the most important thing was that they pay me a lot
Let's say money brings bitches, bitches bring lies
A nigga gets jealous and motherfuckers die
Depends on me as the first and the fifteenth
We got four niggas in low riders and ski masks
Screaming, "Thug Life" every time they pass, all eyes on me
Live the life of a black thug until the day of my death
Live the life of a boss player (all eyes on me) because you're even getting high
All eyes on me
Live the life of a black thug until the day of my death
Live the life of a boss player because you're even getting high
So many problems in the world, nigga
No one can feel your pain
My girl said she needed a raise, how long will it last?
I'm caught between my wife and my gun and my chips
Do triple, I have some smokers, I whistle as I dive
I'm lost on earth with no plan, living a perfect life
Crime boss, smuggling, let me throw this away
Needy prostitutes have a lot of nerve
The abandonment of nervousness makes me pack a TEC
Dedicated to serving this Moët and paying checks
Like the Akai satellite, nigga, I'm always dancing
Not right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawl
Piglet, bend over and be caught, emotionless
My devotion is running my business, nigga, it's still costing
Where are you going, I've been there, I came back alone, friend
Constantly flowing against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's all about the money in this rap shit, this shit shit
What I can do? What can I say? There's another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
My little friend G, can't you see I'm free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me
Live the life of a black thug until the day of my death
Live the life of a boss player because you're even getting high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a black thug until the day of my death
Live the life of a boss player because you're even getting high
All eyes on me
I will Survive? I will die? Come on, let's imagine the possibility
Charging me, the lawyers are holding on
He was hyperactive as a child, cold as a teenager
On my mobile phone, calling the big shots in the main scene
Packing hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with passion, I'm living hard and raw
Catching cases at a fast pace, playing in the fast lane
Hurry up until morning, never stopped until the cash came
Live my life like a black thug until the day of my death
Live my life as a boss player, because I'm even getting high
These niggas have me fucking shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my teeth
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burning rubber
Money is mandatory, hoes are for stress.
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes are on the food ticket, get your money
Son of a bitch, let's get rich and kick him; all eyes on me
Live the life of a black thug until the day of my death
Live the life of a boss player because you're even getting high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a black thug until the day of my death
Live the life of a boss player because you're even getting high
All eyes on me
Pay attention, my niggas! See how that shit goes?
Nigga walks on this motherfucker and it's like, "Bing!"
Cops, bitches, all motherfuckers
(Live my life like a black thug until the day of my death)
(I live my life like a black thug until the day of my death)
(Living life like a beach boss, because he's even getting high)
Hehe heh, it's like what they think
I'm walking around with some ki in my pocket or something
They think I'm going to go back to jail, they really are on that drug
(Live my life like a black thug until the day of my death)
(Live my life as a beach boss)
I know they are watching, I know they have me in range
(Live my life like a black thug until the day of my death)
They have me under surveillance, huh?
All eyes on me, but I know
Big Syke, Newt, Hank, Beugard, Big Sur
Everyone knows how this shit goes
All eyes on me
Fucking OG
Roll up in the club and shit, right?
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
I bet you twisted it, you don't know who to trust
Many niggas who hate gamers try to sound like us
Let's say they're ready for funk, but I don't think they know
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we travel
Hitting motherfuckers when we pass
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, because even when I'm high
Fuck me and then I cross, the future in my eyes
A five-double-oh Benz, flaunting flashy rings, uh
Bitches chase me like a dream
It is known to disappear before your eyes like a drug demon
It seems that the most important thing was that they pay me a lot
The game sharper than a fucking razor blade
Let's say money brings bitches, bitches bring lies
A nigga gets jealous and motherfuckers die
Depends on me as the first and the fifteenth
They can hold me for a second, but these punks won't catch me
We got four niggas in low riders and ski masks
Screaming, "Thug Life" every time they pass, all eyes on me
Live the life of a black thug until the day of my death
Live the life of a boss player because you're even getting high
Live the life of a boss player because you're even getting high
(Heeyyy, my nigga 'Pac)
So many problems in the world, nigga
No one can feel your pain
The world changes every day, time moves fast
Do triple, I have some smokers, I whistle as I dive
I'm lost on earth with no plan, living a perfect life
Crime boss, smuggling, let me throw this away
Needy prostitutes have a lot of nerve
Let my bucket drift, I'm pulling off the sidewalk
The abandonment of nervousness makes me pack a TEC
Like the Akai satellite, nigga, I'm always dancing
Not right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawl
Piglet, bend over and be caught, emotionless
My devotion is running my business, nigga, it's still costing
Constantly flowing against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's all about the money in this rap shit, this shit shit
It's not funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
My little friend G, can't you see I'm free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me
Live the life of a black thug until the day of my death
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a black thug until the day of my death
The feds are watching, niggas plotting to catch me
I will Survive? I will die? Come on, let's imagine the possibility
Charging me, the lawyers are holding on
I told the judge that I was raised badly and that's why I burn shit
He was hyperactive as a child, cold as a teenager
On my mobile phone, calling the big shots in the main scene
Packing hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with passion, I'm living hard and raw
Hurry up until morning, never stopped until the cash came
Live my life like a black thug until the day of my death
Live my life as a boss player, because I'm even getting high
These niggas have me fucking shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my teeth
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer

Live the life of a boss player because you're even getting high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a boss player because you're even getting high
All eyes on me
Pay attention, my niggas! See how that shit goes?
Nigga walks on this motherfucker and it's like, "Bing!"
Cops, bitches, all motherfuckers
(Live my life as a beach boss, because I'm even getting high)
I have busts, hoes and policemen looking at a nigger, you know?
(I live my life like a black thug until the day of my death)
(Living life like a beach boss, because he's even getting high)
Hehe heh, it's like what they think
I'm walking around with some ki in my pocket or something
They think I'm going back to jail, they really are on that drug ...
Let's go everything, let's go everything
Let's go everybody
Take care of your damn mouth, niggas!
(That's right, fuck these fagots niggas!)
Come to hell or high tide, until you kill opponents
Outlaw until I'm done, brandish my leash, back like a cobra
I get drunk because I'm crazy when I'm sober
On a one-man mission, my ambition is to sustain
The rap game, while I make holes in niggas like donuts
And I still die for all my soldiers like hillbillies
They don't fear me, so we fight, bringing war to the city
With every breath death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me unapologetically your honor
With a squad of trusted assassins, quick to move, heavily armed
I come on the scene like sandstorms, then I transform, look at me
I take the figure of 30 niggas that caught me
While the bitches wonder who shot me
Loveless, hold a grudge, shooting slugs like Muammar Gaddafi
Murder my friends, build a new gang
We take pictures of paparazzi, let's go and fly now, nigga, like Rocky
You have a lot of courage to play me, another gay rapper
Bustin 'caps on Jay Z and still avoids capture (Buck buck buck buck)
While you guys are caught up in the rapture, even after me
We used to have nothing and then grab something and bustin
I wanted to be the black thug my old man wasn't
Niggas player-hatin ', cheated on me in all 50 states
I'm yelling "Death row!" Throw away my Westside, it's nothing
They raised us on the road, they raised us to hit
We control all the cash from the Atlantic-Pacific
And understand this: I'm hard to kill when I get hairy with this live place
Father, how the hell did I survive these five shots?
Live or leave and how the hell
Late at night, listen to them scream, "We're all leaving!"
Take them on the path of war, no doubt.
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Every nigga handles yours, wear it strong
If you gotta pay bills, nigga, do it all
You play around with your parents you better do everything
Tryna go the next day, nigga, see everything
Obstacles on your way, you better do your best
I'm on my last leg, walking through the belly of the beast
Feeling like I'm completely drunk as can be
It is easy to see, that we mafia the blacks hidden in bushes
Claiming they ride rough, but they're softer than the cushion
They're softer than bitches in the worst way, drowning in blood
Outlawz, my blood brothers, would die for these thugs
Say hello to this slug
It's a shame how some niggas on the west coast
I'm in Jers to the max, like a little west coast love
But after 'Pac stopped rapping', he's not a West Coast thug
Just West Coast, bitch, my real niggas caught up in the street game
‘Because rappers like Jay Z are pumping Kool-Aid through their veins
Is what I say true? Hit your soft butt to the floor
And watch my fo'-fo 'put holes through your door
Take them on the path of war, no doubt.
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
If you gotta pay bills, nigga, do it all
You play around with your parents you better do everything
Tryna go the next day, nigga, see everything
Now we all ride and die, who with us?
They are nothing but squeals
In this rap game, swearing they're rude
Tattooed, and now niggas swear they're Pac
Leave that, and watch your back, we don't forget you
These Glocks are hot, and when it's fired, it'll get the bitch out
It's me, Kastro with the goat, walking like an OG
‘Because all these motherfuckers owe me
I beg the bully lords like those holy motherfuckers
I do my best, and if you're real, you're real
Feel what I'm talking about, because this game is sick
I live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, until you feel it
Proof of life, Pac breeds niggas they can't deal with
Or put blood on it, what! We're all leaving, nigga!
Come on everyone, pump first until they fall
Take them on the path of war, no doubt.
Every nigga handles yours, wear it strong
If you gotta pay bills, nigga, do it all
You play around with your parents you better do everything
Obstacles on your way, you better do your best
Fool, you better do your best
Keep on going
All my niggas go everywhere
Without a damn doubt
Yeah you niggas just gonna think uhh gonna be
Cleverly speaking of all these damn records
And we won't say shit
Don't disrespect the Don
It's still war, motherfuckers
So let's see you act like you know
How about unspoken love? Is it weaker without a name?
because I don't dare to share his name
Does that make me cruel and cold?
2 deny the world of my salvation
Why shouldn't you be tired?
and retain this love of MAN
How about unspoken love?
nobody knows
But this is a love that lasts
and secretly grows
Learn from his misfortune
Learn from their pain
Believe in something
Believe in yourself
Turn adversity into ambition
Now flourishes in wealth
I won't deny it, I'm a straight rider
There is no one to stop me
So why do you fools keep boxing me?
Do you want to see me handcuffed and call the police with me?
On a mission to be champions since they set me free
There is no one to stop me
So why do you fools keep boxing me?
Do you want to see me handcuffed, call the police with me?
On a mission to be champions, they set me free
Prepare for combat, my adversaries crumble
Accept it, I have a reputation for damage, destroyers prepare to rumble
They locked me in a cell, kept me trapped in a living hell
Although I'm not guilty, I'm still in jail
Brother, I serve my time as a soldier
Behave yourself
My shadow boxing fought to death Bustin 'Boulders
Better give up on love
To shake the world with the burst of my black fist
Now I'm the million dollar champion who's next to get knocked out
Straight from Brooklyn, I'm all over the world, everyone knows me
Dropping everything that comes before me
No one can hold me
And uh
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
There is no one to stop me
So why do these fools keep me locked up?
Do you want to see me handcuffed, call the police with me?
On a mission to be champions since they set me free
I'm a straight rider
There is no one to stop me
So why, fools, do you keep me?
Do you want to see me handcuffed, call the police with me?
On a mission to be champion since they set me free
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
There is no one to stop me
Do you want to see me handcuffed, call the police with me?
On a mission to be champion since they set me free
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
I won't deny it
I'm a straight rider
Next World Heavyweight Champion
Mike Tyson
Go 'head nigga
Get back to the top of where you're supposed to be!
These assholes don't know how to throw them thangs boy
You are a legend
You are a legend!
You'll be boxing for friends
We have nothing but love for you
Stay riding friend
Stay riding
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
I got the police biting me
But they can't do anything to a G
Get ready to party!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really happens in the mind of a black
That come down for yours
No bitches for money
My ambitions as ridah
So many scars on the battlefield while driving in luxurious cars
This life as a rap star is nothing without a guard
Born rough and tough, addressing the mass audience
My attitude was "fuck it", because motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, you must keep your composure at ease
Although life is complicated, only what you make it be
To catch her while it's hot and hot, climb inside her
Then I spat a game into his ear, "Go to TV, ho!"
Equipped with money in a Benz because, bitch, I'm hardly bankrupt
From player to player, the game is tight, the feeling is mutual
From rushed and prayers to breaking motherfuckers to pay
I'm on a food ticket mission, I want a thousand, so I wish
The competition tore me apart for that shit they stress (Booyah)
However, I am a rhyme, the clown tells him that it is mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, the bitch has the game distorted
Now it's on and on because I said so
Now these bitches hungry for money suspect
I started planning and planning a plan to come and twist
But niggas thugs be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart tied the same night
I have problems, so drive, motherfuckers see me
These niggas are jealous
Because deep in their hearts they want to be me
Uh yeah, and now you have me right next to you, waiting for you to hear
I catch you paying attention to my ambitions like a ridah
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
I got the police biting me
(I will not deny it, I am a true ridah)
It was my only wish to get up
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers that I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first on this side, give me the .9
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spitting on adversaries, envious and after me.
I'd rather die than get caught, watch me bleed
Mom, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there will be bullets flying when they catch me (Shoot)
Fuck doing jail time, best day, sacrifice
I will not have the opportunity to do to me as they did to my black Tys
Thuggin 'for life, and if you're right then nigga die for it
Let other brothers try, at least you tried
When it's time to die, be a man and choose the way you go
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as ridah
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
But they can't do anything to a G
My killer letters, equipped with the spirits of thugs in front of me
I hesitated to reappear, I was away for years
Now I am back, my adversaries have been reduced to tears.
I'm sure some bitches bleed
Niggas will feel the fire from my mother's corrupt seed
Throw me but they didn't finish, they didn't diminish my powers
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a damn threat
They are cowards, that's why they tried to trick me
I had bitch niggas on my team so I actually got wet
But I'm back reincarnated, imprisoned
Bind them with legendary lyrics, musical mercenaries
Knowing that when it comes out, they will feel it
The scream of all your people when they find you
I only remember you, my story will be authentic
Take revenge on the niggas who played me
And all the cowards who were with it
Now it's your nigga right next to you, hoping you're listening
I catch you paying attention to my ambitions like a ridah
(My ambitions as a ridah)
I got the police biting me
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
But they can't do anything to a G
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
Oh 2Pac is working now
Ooh, that ass girl
And the tattoos
Don't worry about it, I have dibs on him behind the scenes, so he's going to be on the girl
But then I got into the hotel
Your body though!
"How do you want it? Oooh, how do you feel?"
I want to feel that shit
Tabs you know it's gonna be on
Well where's the motherfucker?
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
I got the police biting me
But they can't do anything to a G
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
I got the police biting me
But they can't do anything to a G
So many scars on the battlefield while driving in luxurious cars
Born rough and tough, addressing the mass audience
My attitude was "fuck it", because motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, you must keep your composure at ease
Uh-huh-huh, and my ambitions as ridah
Then I spat a game into his ear, "Go to TV, ho!"
Equipped with money in a Benz because, bitch, I'm hardly bankrupt
I'm smoking butt weed, feeling crucial
From player to player, the game is tight, the feeling is mutual
From rushed and prayers to breaking motherfuckers to pay
I'm on a food ticket mission, I want a thousand, so I wish
The competition tore me apart with that stress shit (Booyah!)
However, I am a rhyme, the clown tells him that it is mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, the bitch has the game distorted
Now it's on and on because I said so
I can't trust a bitch in the business so I got Death Row
Now these bitches hungry for money suspect
I started planning and planning plans to come and fool us
Me, Syke and Bogart ended the same night
I have problems, so drive, motherfuckers see me
Because deep in their hearts they want to be me
Nah, now you have me right next to you, waiting for you to hear
I catch you paying attention to my ambitions like a ridah
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
But they can't do anything to a G
(I will not deny it, I am a true ridah)
You don't want to fuck me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
I got the police biting me
(I will not deny it, I am a true ridah)
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You do not want ...
Just when I thought I had seen it all
our paths crossed and they met
it would be difficult 2 4get
I couldn't wait 2 lips caresses
and kiss me with the intentions of my heart
when we did it was what i expected
from the discomfort of the concerns of the first date
and initials Blind date First impressions
We kissed again and I felt the passion
and this was CUPID's blessing
I got the police biting me
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
I got the police biting me
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
But they can't do anything to a G

I don't have time for these bitches' cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a food ticket mission, I want a thousand, so I wish
The competition tore me apart with that stress shit (Booyah!)
However, I am a rhyme, the clown tells him that it is mandatory
I can't trust a bitch in the business so I got Death Row

I got the police biting me
But they can't do anything to a G
It was my only wish to get up
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers that I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first to go up, give me 9
That's what they scream as they pierce me, but I'm hard to kill
Spitting on adversaries, envious and after me.
I'd rather die than get caught, watch me bleed
Mom, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there will be bullets flying when they catch me (Shoot)
Fuck doing jail time, best day, sacrifice
I won't have a chance to do to me like they did to my black Tys'
Thuggin 'for life, and if you're right then nigga die for it
Let other bustas try, at least you tried
When it's time to die, be a man and choose the way you go
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
I got the police biting me
But they can't do anything to a G
My killer letters, equipped with the spirits of thugs in front of me
Pay the block, evade the cops because I know they will come for me
I hesitated to reappear, I was away for years
Now I am back, my adversaries have been reduced to tears.
Question my methods for changing speeds
I'm sure some bitches bleed
Niggas will feel the fire from my mother's corrupt seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a damn threat
They are cowards, that's why they tried to trick me
I had bitch niggas on my team so I actually got wet
But I'm back reincarnated, imprisoned
At that moment I contemplate the way that God did it
Bind them with legendary lyrics, musical mercenaries
I've been getting a lot of mail in jail, niggas tell me to kill him
Knowing that when it comes out, they will feel it
I only remember you, my story will be authentic
Take revenge on the niggas who played me
And all the cowards who were with it
Now it's your nigga right next to you, hoping you're listening
I catch you paying attention to my ambitions like a ridah
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah

I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
I got the police biting me
But they can't do anything to a G
Chorus]
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
I got the police biting me
But they can't do anything to a G
Get ready to party!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really happens in the mind of a black
That come down for yours
Constantly money on bitches
No bitches for money
Stay in your routine, nigga
My ambitions as ridah
My ambitions as ridah
So many scars on the battlefield while driving in luxurious cars
Born rough and tough, addressing the mass audience
My attitude was "fuck it", because motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, you must keep your composure at ease
Uh, and my ambitions as ridah
To catch her while it's hot and hot, climb inside her

It was my only wish to get up
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers that I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first on this side, give me the .9
I'm ready to die here tonight and fuck your life
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
(Is that all you got niggas?)
I'd rather die than get caught, watch me bleed
Mom, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinking thoughts
I'm innocent, so there will be bullets flying when they catch me (Shoot)

Knowing that when it comes out, they will feel it
Witness the most real thing, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The scream of all your people when they find you
I only remember you, my story will be authentic
Take revenge on the niggas who played me
And all the cowards who were with it
Now it's your nigga right next to you, hoping you're listening
I catch you paying attention to my ambitions like a ridah
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
But they can't do anything to a G
You don't want to fuck me
I got the police biting me
But they can't do anything to a G
I will not deny it, I am a true ridah
You don't want to fuck me
They want to bury me, I'm worried
I'm losing my mind
Look at the barrel of my nine
And my vision is blurred
Falling apart, am I guilty?
I pray to the lord
But unfortunately he ignores me because I am guilty
I'm choking on the pot smoke
With each tab it's like I'm losing focus
Falling asleep while on duty, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention the funerals that I'm stressing out and going crazy
I wonder when I'll be happy, it's not funny
Bustin caps flashbacks, anything for money
Where I go? I discovered that nothing can save me
My neighbor's neighbor has convo with underwear
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
I see my enemies crawling, don't make me explode
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
I see my enemies crawling, don't make me explode
Will they be G's and will they look at me before they burst?
While I'm in bed, spilling blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a player?
Suspicious of this bitch, the line is busy every time I call her
Now she tells me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I get boned, so we're alone
After I hit the road, see you later
For all the players to see the way a nigga played it
The bitch tells all her friends
That I can fuck her like no other now, those other bitches want to boner me
I take a fifth of Hennessy, I don't think it's healthy
I look at the five o'clock roll, motherfuckers pass by
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
I see my enemies crawling, don't make me explode
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
I see my enemies crawling, don't make me explode
I pray to God, I don't scream when it's time to fry
I have nowhere to rest, I'm losing friends, isn't that a bitch?
When I was rich I had influence, now a black is alone
I put the gun to my head and pray
I see visions of me dead, Lord, are you there?
So tell me, am I lost because I'm alone?
I thought I had friends, but in the end a black man dies alone
I have nowhere to run, I'm terrified and nobody cares
A closed coffin at my funeral and no one is there.
Is there a future for a murderer? I change my ways
But still that doesn't promise me the next day
So I keep hitting with passion, forever exploding
They wonder if I'm in hell
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
Everyone dies, I'm next (I'm next)
I see my enemies crawling, don't make me explode
Ayo, are you afraid of dying?
Tell me which?
LOL
I'm not fear to die

What about Pac?
This for my dog, 2Pac Shakur, 2Pac Shakur
Yes
Today is full of anger
Fed with hidden hatred (fueled with hidden hatred)
Fear of being an outcast bein (fear of being an outcast bein, fear of being an outcast)
Fear of common destiny (fear of common destiny)
Today is based on tragedy (today, is based on tragedy)
That nobody wants to face, that nobody wants to face
Nightmares for humanity (nightmares for humanity)
And morally disgraceful (and morallyaaaaaaaaa)
An opportunity to build again
Tomorrow I see a change (chaaaaaaange)
An opportunity to build again
Today is full of anger, violence fills the air
Today I lay my head down, but the pressure never stops
Gnawin before my sanity, happy when I fall
But tomorrow, I see a change ...
Tomorrow I see a change (but tomorrow I see a change)
An opportunity to build again
Built on the spirit, content of the heart.
And truth-based ideals
And tomorrow is the same
I am strong for my pride
Know that I fought with all my heart
To keep my dreams alive
And tomorrow (heyyyyyyyyyyyyyeahhhheyy)
Tomorrow (ooooooooh tomorrow tomorrow ...)
Today is full of anger
Fed with hidden hatred
Fear of common destiny
Today is built on tragedies
that nobody wants 2 faces
Nightmares 2 humanities
and morally dishonored
Tonight is full of anger
Violence in the air
Children raised cruelly
Because nobody at home cares
But the pressure never stops
gnaw my sanity
content when I fall
But 2morrow c change
An opportunity 2 to build again
and truth-based ideals
And 2 morning I wake up with a second wind
2 I know I fought with all my heart 2 I keep my dream alive
Love, love, oh no! (Oh yeah)
This is for my baby boo (that's you)
Now what about the baby?
The Red Rat will always love you, always!
I pray the day you say you love me too
I'd do anything to make you my baby boo
I have nothing if I don't have you
I want you to be my baby boo
And this is just for you, just for you!
I'd leave all my girls for you
Walk barefoot around the world for you
Fly like birds for you
So I wrote these words for you ...
I don't have everything ...
In fact, I have NOTHING! (Yes)
From my heart (definitely)
Accept the G for a better day (yeah)
And you tell me to find my way (yes, yes baby, yes)
... but I know the man that I'm sure to make mistakes (everyone does)
Of course yes!
I don't think you know
How do you make me shine
I really want you to know (know)
ME!..
I'd leave all my girls for you
Walk barefoot around the world for you
Fly like birds for you
So I wrote these words for you ...
And if that meant my love was really true (yeah)
I would gladly die and take care of you (believe it)
I wish you know how much I cared
You would see that my love is true, that love that we would share (of course!)
Do you think I (uhh)
Even if you change your mind
And said that our love was over
I'll die, I'd cry, but I'll still love you (yeah)
ME!
I bena or don't bother me about you
I'd do anything to make you my baby boo
If it doesn't work, I still love you
It is for our love, whatever happens
I will still love you (I love you)
I don't have everything
In fact, I have nothing,
except a dream of a better day
And you, to help me find my way
Being a man, I'm sure to make mistakes
But to support you, I'd do whatever it takes
and if that meant my love was really true
I would gladly die and take care of you
I wish you knew how much I cared
You would see that my love is true. For the life we would share
Even if you changed your mind and said that our love was through
I would like to die, cry continuously and still love you
Joint union, what is my role?
I'm working on tracks to play niggas that work
It's the damn gangsta all the way (Hey)
The one that brings you styles in timesy-wimesy
Driving, building when I burst
Because I had to break the top of the H-E-A-D
It's a must with my nigga Richie Rich and 2Pac
I'm Warren G, I have a watch
Finish with my nigga SN double O P
D O double G, Y D O double G
Let me go back because I'm like this, look
The LB to the damn gangsta C
Don't trip, brother
Let me kick a motherfucker because I flow for my friend
Well i can take one two and let you know it's overkill
Standing finna shoots young Syke
What you want to do is launch your stream to let them know
When comes R-F-E double E though (Woo)
Once for the camera, Richard came to hit you
Picking your hat, yeah Georgetown fantasy
With the bulldog, oh oh, why do you want to do me?
Because uhh if a nigga tries to play with you
Although he is saying to your son as if it were a beach, but
Don't knock, hang up, right?
What you want to do is walk away from me
And I'll be picking up the slack
It's thug 2 Pacalypse now to grab the gat and rip the track
It's not a damn funny thing, work with me, son
I'm calm in my business, it's time to hit that shit
I'm going up the track because I'm down with the clique
And all my niggas in the house are drunk
Time to take our drink, nigga
And smoke a lot wet and uh
Bitches are catching fumes and uhh
Clinton could not save us
And it's all in 'cause the niggas are dancing
I drive a damn Benz because I'm all inside
And don't have friends
That's why we made this damn animosity.
I'm not giving up, I talk a lot of shit
But niggas don't want jargon cause I bring them
I'm 165 years old, but I'm high until I die
Then what do you want to do? Bring all your fucking crew
And my glock will make your niggas run down the block
My nigga Syke, he does what he likes
And he's next on the mic, so you ain't gonna hit these hella high niggas
I'll never trust a bitch again
You can get that ass if they think you rich
Hungry bitches, I can see them a mile away
They get nice when it's close to their birthday
All they do is stay and stay down
And don't try to face me, you damn clown
Because your wife is fine but she is not yours
Cause she crawls out my damn back door
It feels good the way I make her moan
Because she is not served like this at home
If I keep it too late, it could get me in trouble
You think a lot but I have to burst your bubble
He bragged about his friends, so I fucked his crew.
Cause I'm single when a gangsta has to mix
And while I stabbed it, ooh, it tingled
I will leave them, I will leave them, yes I can see
How to be with me, that's my change
But your cookie hungry hoes would stay saved
So let a bitch be a bitch, and a ho be a ho
Because if you call and wheels, you will never know
So never again, never again
So don't get a woman, just have friends
{* singing in another language *}
When your hero falls from grace, all the fairy tales are discovered
Myth exposed and pain magnified, grace pays uncovered
He told me to be strong, but I confused seeing you so weak
You say never give up, and it hurts to see you welcome defeat
When your hero falls so attached to the stars, and so does the perception of tomorrow
Without my hero, I am alone, to deal with my pain
What are you expected to do when your only hero falls?
While some suffer, the river flows forever
As long as there is pain, the river flows forever
As strong as a smile can be, the river will flow forever
And while you're with me, we'll ride the river together ...
..And while you are with me, we will ride together by the river
We will ride together ... the river, as long as you are with me
The river ... will flow forever, as long as you are with me
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
Hey, turn that on, Snoop! Why are you acting like this?
Ahh shit, you're already screwed
(It's nothing more than a gangsta party)
You put two of the most wanted in America
In the same damn place at the same time?
Ha ha ha ha you all niggas about to feel this
(It's nothing more than a gangsta party)
Break the champagne glasses and the damn condoms
Do you have one on us?
(It's nothing more than a gangsta party)
Perfect picture, I paint a perfect picture
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fucking friend
You are a cold black in those pigs
Sure, I keep my hand on my gun
Because they put me on the run
Now I'm back in the room, waiting for the result
"Free 2Pac" is everything on a black man's mind
But at the same time, it seems like they're trying to take mine
So I get smart and I get defensive and that shit
And organize a Million March for a gangsta shit
So now they have us tied
Two billionaire motherfuckers catching cases
Bitches get ready to launch, shit is about to fall
Snoop and me about to clown
I'm losing my religion, I'm cruel to these feces pigeons
You may be immersed in this game, but you are missing the rules
Niggas act like savages, they go out looking for cabbage
I have nothing but love for my niggas who live luxuriously
I have a house in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I have a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and make it all legal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
See, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker
Now go on while we ride
Shit the rest, two of the best on the west side
Niggas has been dying for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a serious crime
I never stop rescuing these damn G's
If you have it, better show off
Another order, two of the most wanted in the United States.
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
(Nothing but a gangsta party)
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
(Nothing but a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
(Nothing but a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
Now give me fifty feet
And keep what's left of me
Lean in the presence of a chief player
Everyone at the party doing silly things
You have to have papers in this world
You can get your first start before your eyes swirl
And then you work so hard until your hair turns gray
You see, we live for the gun, so we die for the guns, kids
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I have a discard
Floating in the black Benz (Bitch), trying to make a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots.
Niggas it's hard to kill on my block
Currency and mass schemes
Affiliated with scammers, so we did
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
(Nothing but a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
(Nothing but a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
(Nothing but a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
Female dog! Where are you where are you
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
Yes death row
While some suffer
The river flows forever
As long as there is pain
The river flows forever
As strong as a smile can be
The river will flow forever
And while you're with me
We will ride the river together
As the world spins ...
As the world goes round, my niggas grow and grow and grow
And get dough and roll and ride
Blacks die and mothers cry
Niggas have alibis, suicides and homicides
And three blows and your life and my life and my times change
And black fame, as the world turns ...
Although I walk through the valley of hell, the shadow follows me. Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow, wait apologies
Probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
And still stranded. Ruthless thieves stole the best of me
I beg black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build and achieve monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change
If we look deeper
God bless the scammer, curse the first sleeper
When we ride, the frames keep all my enemies blind
Like last year, blacks got caught up in the past, and it's clear
Only a few bastards are allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the mafia, M.O.B
Lyrically fatally driven, niggas reported missing
My competition dead or in prison, while the world turns ...
Round, round, round, round and round
My niggas grow and grow and grow
(As the world turns)
Getting mass and mass and mass
From this state to that state
I Pac Cover Me, I'm in it for the luxury
Careless with me, I'm fucking creepy, dreams of millions (and moms in this bitch)
Time to keep my buildings green, kept unfilled
New street geek plucka ', a long wrap without rubba'
Listen to my Bompton, Outlaw blows up the Compton, halving you in pumpin (Jersey on this bitch)
I hit the razor and slap it on the chocolate
Move it down like Emmett, just five minutes
I have my city extended, Saddam Hussan
To Big San, San Wan, I'm the first bomb
Dear mom, I disrespected your vagina
House-of-ca, when the police were behind you
Some niggas froze, the money still tripled
Fools will hit you, I keep my hands on the gun
Fake tears, real closed coffin overpowered it
Not professionally, I crawl aggressively
Think of me and my gats, upload applications like a sexual
For this pain and agony, I feel an alleged gravity
And my heart ached, like I had voodoo pins stabbing me
(Ooh shit)
Rest in peace soldier (Rest in peace soldier)
Haha
As the world turns
(And my niggas pass by, hahaha)
As the world turns
(Niggas get a spinning eye, and it won't stop and won't stop
As the world turns
(Niggas die for this, how many niggas try this?)
As the world turns
(Assassination methods ... haha, OUT!)
Only the haters caught feelings when my friend caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss living
We cross driven, cornered in a life that is hellish
Paying our debts with bloodshed is not bullshit, everyone could tell us
Fellas: ride, it's time for battle, that's it
Two worlds colliding, armies riding, soldiers born wild
Sometimes I think that my glory days returned to my youth
I also looked for the family, but I lost it in these ounces
Now, as the world changes the court session, I am sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins is too much, there's nothing left to gain
October 9, 1977 first day out of my baby carriage
Married my MAC-11 hit the block playing
Just five years up on this bitch, dad running from the feds
Putting peanut butter on the walls to hide their tracks
Me alone, not yet grown, but only man of the home
To protect my area on these streets I wander
D-low mass, lowering straight shots of Cristal Brothers
Box of $ 100 snot on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, I have a plot, I move my block down
I've got the drop in place, moving pounds of weight
Fuck my destiny and a lot of booty to burn, a scammer craves
Aye-yo! (As the world turns)
Who gets money, the REAL G nigga!
Fuck that little five hundred dollar shit that little hundred dollar shit
I'm talking about a new creep
JESUS BLACK, I know he sees and only he can feed us
I believe you, you believe us
Only leaders without followers
(Haha), my .44 GO, Four-Four, and they drop
When a nigga imagines you all wearing a cop (Haha)
Anyone who tries to stop me, get me off this planet. I can't KEEP fooling you niggas if you try to ban this here.
Don't be afraid The outlaws have come nigga disappear when we run (Bitch)
When we come when we ride
Suicide and homicide is what we supply.
Niggas die, don't cry now (As the world turns)
What you found, pound niggas, three fifty-seven, all the way to heaven (Haha)
My MAC-11 keeps these niggas breathing, who do you believe in?
Only he can see us, JESUS BLACK
Haha, yes, yes, how the world turns (how the world turns)
Death row haha
Lil 'Napoleon is definitely this Bi-yatch
With a big ass four and five bigger than him (Haha)
Niggas don't want it (Outlawz Nigga)
WESTSIDE, Nigga, we got Jersey
We have the bay to Los Angeles, the best side
Westside (Everyone knows what time it is)
When you close your eyes and wake up in the morning
I feel you ... baby, no ...
Baby don't cry I hope you raised your head
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry I hope you raised your head
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Uh
No one knew about his secret, so it took awhile
I could see a tear slowly fall down her black cheek
Sheddin's silent tears in the back seat; so when she asked me
"What would you do if it were you?"
Couldn't respond to such horrible pain to live
I couldn't imagine three crazy niggas holding on to me
For a moment I was trapped in pain
Four niggas raped, chased me and raped me
Although it wasn't me, I could feel the pain
Thinking with a brain burst that would make the pain go away
Not! You have to find a way to survive
Baby please don't cry you gotta keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry you gotta keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry I hope you raised your head
Even when the road is hard, never give up
baby Do not Cry
You all are a bunch of fucking sholes
You know why?
You need people like me so you can point the finger
And say "That's the bad guy."
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Even though I'm stressed, keep a vest to protect you
From the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
Straight soldier, resisting them bustas
No matter how you try, n * ggas never dies
We simply retaliate with hatred, which we multiply
Watch me knock down the block hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living how I want
I can't stop at the red lights, I'm on my side
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Zigzagging down the highway
The most real motherfucker you've ever seen
Say goodbye to BAD
Everyone must die ...
(All of you a lot of shit * sholes)
Say goodbye to BAD
(You don't have the guts to be what you want to be)
Say goodbye to BAD
Everyone must die ...
(You need people like me ..)
Say goodbye to BAD
(So you can point your f * ckig fingers and say "That's the BAD TYPE").
There is no escape from mortal destiny
And every day there are a million black bodies saved
Sometimes I drown in the indo, crawling out the window
I have no love of the house
I am outside on the streets screaming "Mother, peace!"
Live the bully's life, n * gga stay faithful
I wonder when they will kill me, is there a heaven for a real G?
Lord forgive me if you feel me
Because all my life I was dirty without hope
Skinny little mother * cker wanting dough
I hated cutting off shoots with my razor blade
But every day it's a fight to get a big pay
Say goodbye to BAD
(You don't have the guts to be what you want to be)
Say goodbye to BAD
Everyone must die ...
(You need people like me ..)
(So you can point your f * ckig fingers and say "That's the BAD TYPE").
The only way to change is maybe to exploit my brain
Stuck in the middle of the game to ease the pain
Poverty bothers me, but mom is doing wonders in the kitchen
Listens! I can hear her cry in the bedroom
Praying for money, but never think I'd be dead soon
Am I wrong to want to be somewhere else?
Can I blame Dad for leaving me?
So my mom doesn't love me alone at a young age
They pay me
And I'm tied up so I'll never be afraid
I can't go back, my eyes on the prize
I have nothing to lose (I have nothing to lose)
Say goodbye to BAD
Everyone must die ...
(All of you a lot of shit * sholes)
Say goodbye to BAD
(You don't have the guts to be what you want to be)
Everyone must die ...
Say goodbye to BAD
(So you can point your f * ckig fingers and say "That's the BAD TYPE").
Yes, ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier
Although unclear, to be the man it was planned
All my road dogs, official mafia figures
I love to act, the first to bomb when we steal niggas
I can be lost in my own mind
I swore I saw the devil in my empty Hennessy glass
Talking to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin '"Fuck the police!" As I walk the night streets
Little boy running wild towards danger
What is the cause Do not be alarmed, death to all strangers
Maybe i'm crazy
I promise ruthless retaliation, nothing is colder
Close your eyes, listen to the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for life, I'll be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime that I will lead
Close your eyes, listen to the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It is a crazy world full of sin.
Close your eyes…
Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Revenge is a bitch, changed, now the trick is crossed
Shaken and never heard from again
A single witness yelling, "Bloody murder, murder!"
A blind man and a corpse, I am ready to leave the city.
Homie had to attack the task force
Stupid policemen tried to play us, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get them back
Upon my secret arrival
Two Glock four and five, time to survive
Death to my rivals. Tell me, what do you want, Lord?
No one left after the death of a drug dealer
The situation is critical, nothing is colder
Than listen to the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for life, I'll be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime that I will lead
Close your eyes, listen to the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It is a crazy world full of sin.
Be a coward, put your hands on the moon
So ruthless, I'm terrorizing niggas in my ballads
Do you feel Me? Capo or Capi-tan
One day I will be the Don; until then, stay strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation.
Bustin 'my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggas facin '60 years
Taking private jets, trying to survive the game
For all my friends who will never be alive again
All they promise us is death, nigga
Take a breather, come be the last one left, nigga
It's real now, feel it or fantasize, there's nothing colder
Listen, you can hear it: the ballad of a dead soldier
Thug for life, I'll be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime that I will lead
Close your eyes, listen to the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It is a crazy world full of sin.
Close your eyes and listen to the ballad of a dead soldier
This is for Kato, Mental, all the niggas who passed away.
Mutulu, Geronimo, Seyku: all the shameless riders
All the niggas who left him, all the soldiers.
All the niggas that go through that day-to-day fight.
(This is the ballad of a dead soldier!)
All the niggas that passed
All niggas with ambition and money in their hearts
All the niggas that want something and don't take none
Hahaha (It's the ballad of a dead soldier!)
The police are so afraid of us
They want to see us dead
They took pictures of a black head, (Ballad of a dead soldier!)
Trying to see me chained, shit
Those niggas will never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell, they'll see me in hell
(Porque Because it's the ballad of a dead soldier!)
I have my guns armed
Run the whole damn block; Fuck the police!
Police? We run these streets, nigga
(I didn't hear the ballad of a dead soldier!)
These niggas can't see me, half the world wants to be me
But nigga, you know, it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
Shooting '96 sho '
Shooting '96 sho '
And sit in a chair, won't you get rid of the big black booty?
Shake it like you don't care
Just shake it like you don't care
We go down to pound ourselves with a ski mask on our faces
Prolly be classic, I laugh at them like fake ass like a joke
But they don't want to get their ass kicked
My competitions run until they last
Never get them to play the coffin
And drunkards who live learn the truth
Boo, don't trust your friends, niggas attack you
It's true, challenge yourself ...
Better days, hey
Better days
You got me thinking of better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hears
Better days
Time to question our lifestyle, see how we live
Smoking weed like it's nothing, so even kids
I want to try it now, then lie down and be pierced
Facing demons, addicted to hearing victims screaming
I guess we were wicked since we were born, a product of cursed semens
‘Because even our birthdays are cursed days
I would love to see the block alone
Without more corrupt traffickers and police, the only way to stop the beast
It is up to us to clean the streets, it is not the same, too many murders
Too many funerals and too many tears.
I just saw another brother buried, plus I knew him for years
He went through his family, but what could he say?
Hold your head up high and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days
Better days, better days
You got me thinking of better days
Hears
Better days
You got me thinking of better days
Thinking of adolescence, you would have guessed
Some say the ghetto is sick and corrupt
I try to keep my head up and stay strong
All my friends slander and I spend all day
But they were wrong, so I'm lonely and very broken
And me too, I can't take her to the places she wants to go
So we argue and play fight, all day and all night
Making 'passionate love' until daylight
Also, we are about to be evicted, we cannot pay the rent
I guess it's time to see who your friend really is
So many blessings as we get stressed, looking for better days (for better days)
Better days, better days
Hey better days
Thinking of better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hears
You got me thinking of better days
Now you and I were really cool, hell with those fools
Since we went back to high school, we were real, you and me
Affiliated with gang members and still succeeded
I still dress like adult men when we shoot
Out in the dark, smoking 'Newports, gamin' marks
I locked you in the corral and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked movies of old friends
I wait for you well, I know it's hell
Hanging out in cells, you need mail when you're in jail
And I am fine
Every once in a while I remember
And I wonder how we got to this; I miss the best days
Hey better days
Thinking of better days
Hears
Better days
You got me thinking of better days
I sent this to all the boys here, huh
Clinton Closure, Rikers Island
All those guys I was locked up with, hehe
Block E, Block F, Lower H
N-I-C on Rikers Island, southern state
All the towns I met along the way
You're not lying to me, who?
O.F.T.B. in this bitch
Better days, hey, better days
You got me thinking of better days
Better days, better days, better days, hey, better days
You got me thinking of better days
Time to question our lifestyle, see how we live
Smoking weed like it's nothing, so even kids
I want to try it now, lie down and run
No one looks at the clock that the wicked does
Facing demons, addicted to listening to victims screaming
Because even our birthdays are cursed days
I would love to see the block alone
Without more corrupt traffickers and police, the only way to stop the beast
It is up to us to clean the streets, it is not the same
Too many murders, too many funerals and too many tears.
I just saw another brother buried and I knew him for years
He went through his family, but what could he say?
Hold your head up high and try to keep the faith
Better day, better days, better days, heyyy
Hey it seems like yesterday i used to play
Along the way, those were the best days
Grow up like a carefree child
Mom said he was crazy about 3
Even the pops showed me love, he was there
I remember hanging out playing truth or challenge
We didn't have much, so we made the most of it
What we could pay but we had love
Tryna grow can sneak and curse
A TV set has, to cut it in the first
Back in the good times and the Jeffersons
Those are the days that I miss and remember
So I wish constant ...
Along the path of memory, I walk and stalk the streets
It's '96 there is nothing to change, but the years
I shed some tears, I had it this far
Look, I want something more in life
3 hits are not a joke, these targets
Has us on a tightrope
Knowing that we're down to fall
We niggas dance, we want it all
Kill each other for something small
It's time to wake up, I call all those
Who wants to listen, take a look
Observe your position, do you like what you see?
Poverty and frustration, aggravation, temptation.
They bought a posse mo’termination bottle
They kept it real and they keep it real
Why i say hey
You got me thinking of a better day
Better days, better days, better days, heyyy
Better days, better days
You got me thinking of better days
It's crazy to get out of the ghetto and have some
And when you get it, don't forget where you come from
Sleeping with the enemy, living in them they block
A hood from the slums, it's not about nuttin
They can't bear to see a black man having something
Stereotype, television made them squirm
Check the statistics, black people with companies
Legitimate investments, yes we come
And they were afraid of us, for many years they mistreated us
Hitting us, left us swinging on the rope
Now ask yourself who is supplying the drug
Now when we do, Armageddon comes.
Are they willing to die for their illegal acts?
It will take a nation of millions to stop us
It's time for a family reunion
We have to stop meeting at these muthafuckin funerals
So we can all live and see better days, dayyys
Thinking of better days
Better days, better days, better days, heyyy
Better days, better days
You got me thinking of better days
That goes to the lingo
Waiting for the day for us to overcome
All the obstacles set up to keep us dumb
Everyone has a destiny that they have to control
Spend your life behind bars and the rest on probation
We know that nobody cares about the boys below
Do you want to see us in a cell somewhere, where you rot?
Survival is a must, so I kill to survive
I see mothers on their knees every night she prays
Better days
Was it the liquor that made me act blind, sometimes when I'm with her?
Will I love or reject her?
I'm sick of this outrageous shit I deal with wit
Trying to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy are no longer carefree
Because so much shit your girlfriends keep telling me
I'm on tour, but now my room is an open door
Then it made me think, what am I trying for?
When he was young he was very foolish, eager to please
A little trick on a mission trying to get into my P
We don't love bitches and we believe they don't love niggas
I thought you had changed but now I know
I can't make a ho a housewife, baby, and there you have it
There you are, you go, acting like a ho
Acting like a ho, acting like a ho
HOE! Look at the word on the streets, you're a
HOE! Just a groupie on a world tour
HOE! Now I discovered for myself that you are a
These silly bitches have this twisted game
So I don't claim them, I just hit them
Dad raised a player, so player, I play them
And the head makes me beg, still that's not enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch is lying too much
When she dies to fuck me, you'll be buying her things, ho
Look girlfriend, I know, all your M.O. is mainly concerned
Get clown after clown, city from coast to coast - see
I've been trying to get away from whores like you
Got me completely turned off by that shit you do
I knew from jumping your aim, straight through them spandex, not facing
Just name, spots on your body for you to touch while holding this game
I keep flowing like H20, it's nothing for me to say
Why do you keep acting like a ho? But there you have
Yeah come on
(My fault)
Put your hands in the air!
Let's go, Let's go, Let's go, Let's go
My dick a little loose, so I go around the block
Call my cousin Snoop as I pounce on the Coupe
Stop by my homey Dru home to blow on the circuit
Damn, almost disappeared, floating on cloud one nine
Liquor store, so I have some gin and juice mixed
I have a quarter pound outbreak, so I'm screwed too
Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve
Rescued in the crib (for what?) Because I'm all inclusive
I talked and then I pulled out that hoe
I made myself some food, then I got rid and said
Tomorrow, tomorrow, take a look
Here we go and we'll come back to get your dick out
G up, hoes down
If you can't swim, you will surely drown
Two in the morning at the dizot, I stop and stizop
I remember in that butt I rizzocked
Now I'm high as a kite
Four in the morning as I go back to my crib
To see what happens to my wife and my newborn son
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
We do this every day at almost the same time, beyotch!
I was in the park one day, that's when I saw his face
She seemed a bit cavi to me
(Don't stop, come on)
But when I take her home and touch that butt, I'm leaving
I'm just a dog, don't blame me
Yes
Now I love them hoes? (Hell no!)
And why is that? (Because you are Snoop Doggy Dogg
And you never cared about a bitch
Because to you, bitches are not shit, but hoes and tricks)
Ha ha, dee dee dadi dadi dah
Listen to the sounds of my black Doggy Dogg
Slipping through town on rag six-fo '
Hitting all the places but I'm on target
Park my ride like me, come in, like me
Put my nine double M by my side, while I
Continue my mission
Pussy is my plate and I'm fishing, wishing
On a star, to go to some extremes
Then I can put my pimp
Because my pen puts my pimp from G to ozone
Tell your friends bitch
All your bitch friends
It's just a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a gansta party
It's nothing more than a Gansta party
Uh, perfect picture, I paint a perfect picture
Bombard the suckas with precision, my intention is to enrich myself
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fucking friend
Sure, I keep my hand on my gun
Now I'm back in the room, waiting for the result
"Free 2Pac" is everything on a black man's mind
But at the same time, it seems like they're trying to take mine
And organize a Million March for a gangsta shit
So now they have us tied
Two billionaire motherfuckers catching cases
Snoop and me about to clown
I'm losing my religion, I'm cruel to these feces pigeons
Niggas act like they're wild, I'll go get the cabbage
I have nothing but love for my niggas who live wild
I have a house in the hills right next to Chino
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and make it all legal
And let yourself be carried away by the little friend of the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
See, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker
Now go on while we ride
Shit the rest, two of the best on the west side
And i can make you famous
Niggas has been dying for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a serious crime
I never stop rescuing these West Coast G's
If you have it, better show off
Another order, two of the most wanted in the United States.
It's nothing more than a gangsta party, party
(Nothing but a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
(Nothing but a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
(Nothing but a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
Give me fifty feet
And keep what's left of me
Jealousy is envious, suffering is greed
I burst and run, these niggas must be crazy, what?
Lean in the presence of a chief player
It's like Cuzz, Blood gang-bangin '
Everyone at the party doing silly things
You have to have papers in this world
You can get your first start before your eyes swirl
You do your job every day
Let me tell you about life and the way it is
They say we live by the leash, we die by the leash, children
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I have a discard
Floating in the black Benz, trying to make a show a day
Niggas it's hard to kill on my block
Currency and mass schemes
Affiliated with scammers, so we did
There are no answers to the questions, I'm trying to get up
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted
Gangsters now run this motherfucker? (Hell yeah)
Gangsters now run this motherfucker? (Hell yeah)
Now the ladies run this motherfucker? (Hell yeah)
West Side is fucking here
West Side is fucking here
West Side is fucking here
West Side is fucking here
West Side is fucking here
West Side is fucking here
West Side is fucking here
Outlawz is fucking here
Death row!
Death row in this motherfucker
West Side!
The west side!
Peace!
Bad Boy Killers in the House
Mobb Assassins deep in the house
What you all niggas know about Coco No
Nothing but a gangsta party
Leave the house loose
Doggy style in this motherfucker
Thug life, microphone check
Where do you come from bitch niggas?
I can hear your style, it sounds like Makaveli The Don
2Pac, my nigga
So many troubles in the nigga world
These niggas can't feel your pain
Thug life, outlaw, forever
The toughest black
Ever play this microphone
Got you bitch niggas trailing his tail
Keep trying black, keep trying black
Eternity, infinity
So remember Makaveli The Don
His bully life lives on
Black Cotton, Black Cotton
Black cotton: a symbol of fight without reward
Time for a little gospel story
Gospel of the ghetto, that is, listen!
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
Talk!
Black cotton, constant stress, Smith & Wessons, count my blessings
Why do we work as slaves sweating blades in an early grave?
They never paid me but we are still slaves (in the nine threes)
Answer that, then answer this too
Love will catch you, you know it's true, life is a bitch, right?
Better to go back and try to act black and live
Not to be false and positive, but why be negative?
What's wrong, G? Did the black cat stick your tongue out at you?
Do you feel Me? Dum dum diddy, is it me?
Try to reach each and every brother on the streets.
If it's not peace, then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing dead in the streets dead
Looking through my high school yearbook
Remembering the tears as the years went by
One friend, two friends, three friends: POOF!
We used to have troops, but now there are no more youth to shoot
God, come save the begotten
Lost souls of the black cotton ghetto (in the eyes of God)
No one doesn't care (no matter how hard I try
I look at the sky and ask God why)
No one does not care (It seems my dreams
Drowned out by the screaming, there is no answer to my questions)
No one cares (it feels like I'm under pressure
Why am I stressed? It's like it's being tested)
No one cares (it seems my prayers
Missing in midair, please answer my questions)
Nobody cares
In the belly of the beast I am bubbling
Running out of luck, about to self-destruct
Old men say you live your life as such
I'm sure you'll catch her with your one-day boy
I wouldn't listen to them
Your power move was great, but it doesn't fix anything
Look what the 80s did to us babies
And now that we've grown, no one owns us yet
Black cotton, I'm up to what they owe me
I'm working non-profit, all my friends are piling up
It hurts, but be aware it's not irritating
And we don't stop, they are curtains
You try to get up and we certainly survive with Outlaw Ridaz
Runnin 'up, armed weapon, black mask and gloves
If you don't have a penny, watch your glove, no love
Waiting for my 40 acres and a blunt to burn
Biblical times, good hearts with militant minds
Black cotton: I'm jumping on the enemy lines
Black cotton - I won't stop until they give me mine
Black cotton
No one doesn't care (no matter how hard I try
I look at the sky and ask God why)
No one cares (it feels like I'm under pressure
Why am I stressed? It's like it's being tested)
No one cares (it seems my prayers
Missing in midair, please answer my questions)
(2Pac speaking)
Black cotton
Black cotton
(Oh yeah)
"my pain?"
It's profound, share it with me ”
(Um)
Black cotton
Time for a little gospel queue
Gospel of the ghetto that is
Listens
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
(It will catch you, it will catch you)
Talk
(It will catch you, it will catch you)
(Verse one: 2Pac)
Black cotton
Constantly stressful Smith and Wesson count my blessing
Why do we work as slaves? sweaty blades to an early grave
They never paid me but we're still slaves in the nine threes
Answer that and then answer this too
Love will catch you, you know it's true, life is a fucking true
Better to go back and try to act black and live
What's up G? Black cat has your tongue
Fat track made you jump now your hung (Can you feel me?)
I try to reach each and every one of the brothers on the streets.
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets, deceased
Looking at my high school yearbook
Remembering the tears as the years went by
One homie, two homie, three homies, poof
God come to save the begotten
Lost souls of the black cotton ghetto (cotton)
In the eyes of God
(Chorus)
Mom told me they were going to be like this, but I'm angry.
(Annoying)
He said it would be days like this
(They claim that I am violent)
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
Hit
(Verse two: Mouse Man)
Black cotton
Rotten like the rest every day is a test
Protection wearing a vest is your best bet
Hungry for money thinking about the jack pot
Jewelry and fat knots get accessories
In the corner slandering marijuana I want to get paid
He was not born with the silver spoon
(I never had)
That's why I act, you say I'm crazy lazy
But this is what you gave me, I don't have enough to feed my baby
If I decide to sell my soul, swallow my pride that you can't
Hide from the truth, youth is dying inside
Careful instead of stepping foot outside
Screaming over the negative vibrating look in my crazy eyes because they're at the prize
No wondering about the low attempt to stay low
I must make my email defamatory and say no
The crack vial stays piled on my door
The future scares me, you don't listen to me
Young black males to the top
Can't stop, straight from the school of hard knocks
(Uh)
God come to save the begotten
Ghetto lost souls black cotton
In the eyes of God
Yes
(They claim that I am violent)
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
(Will catch you)
(They claim that I am violent)
(Will catch you)
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
(Will catch you)
(Will catch you)
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
(Will catch you)
I'm pissed off
(Will catch you)
They claim that I am violent
(Will catch you)
My mom told me they would spend the day like this, but I'm angry.
They claim that I am violent
(Will catch you)
(Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God)
Annoying
(Will catch you)
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
Straight angry
But they say I'm violent
Mom told me they were going to be like this, but I'm angry.
(Why?)
They claim that I am violent
(Will catch you)
(Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God)
Straight angry
(Will catch you)
Straight angry
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
(They claim that I am violent)
My mom told me they would be like this one day
They claim that I am violent
(Will catch you)
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
They claim that I am violent
He said it would be days like this
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
(Will catch you)
My mom told me they would be like this one day
Mom told me they were going to be like this, but I'm angry.
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
(Booyaka)
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
(They claim that I am violent)
(Booyaka, Booyaka)
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
They claim that I am violent
(Will catch you)
Rotten black cotton in the eyes of God
Black cotton
Looking for the black Jesus
Oh yes, wearing jewelry and things like that, yaknahmean?
Tattooed right
(Baptist, Jehovah's Witness) Without a doubt
(Bullies, we praise black Jesus, all day)
Young Gaddafi in this bitch, turn it on, nigga ...
We believed in you
For everything you do
I just want to let you know how we feel
Black jesus
I shoot my shots on a knob, praying to God for my squad
Although times are tough, through thick and thin, I play my cards
Like I'm incarcerated, shots hitting my place like midnight rain
I'm not trying to get caught in any block
Slandering the rocks like bean cakes
Brainstorm at the beginning
I wonder how shit like the Quran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
God's words or a curse like crack?
Shai-tan's way of recovering
Or just another of the traps of my black Jesus
Who has the heart to be by my side?
I feel my enemies creep silently
Dark prayers, cries of violence: demons around me
I can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black jesus
Give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
Because I swear, they try to break my well
I'm on the edge looking at this bottomless pit
Does it matter if I cease to exist? Black jesus
Everyone cheers, the pressure that no effort can fail
Submissive souls become hoes when exposed to prison
In times of war we need someone crude, to gather the troops
As a saint we can trust to help us overcome
Black Jesus, hahahaha
It is like a saint that we can trust to help us improve ourselves.
Black jesus
Stick-ups, steal niggas with trigger hiccups
Bodybag, punk pills when these niggas are gonna fuck up
Nine and a half out of ten, handcuffed wrists twist in a short time
And to hurry, go to the block with the police Glocks bustin '
They think it is fun to really kill
In addition to receiving twenty 20 bills, twenty minutes still making money
The patrollers will be rolling, trying to hug us and chase us
They all pounced on us, because we grouped in the corners
My Black easy Jesus please someone feed us
I'm shooting, starting a revolution with my kids
Too close to the sword, prison fell forever, black Jesus
I dedicate myself to this clique, criminal oriented
An outlaw started, turned on and vanished
Made for terror, niggas from the big leagues pray together
Bitches in the grave while my real niggas play together
We die glasses filled with bomblastic liquor
Cremado, the last wish is that blacks smoke my ashes
I will continue, while I am carelessly copied
Policemen patrol projects, hate the people who live in them
I was born an inmate, hoping to escape prison.
I went to church but I don't get it, they vanished
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast until they're high up; baptize them evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine, trick
Which one of you wants to feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze in front of black Jesus
Everyone cheers, the pressure that no effort can fail
In times of war we need someone crude, to gather the troops
As a saint we can trust to help us overcome
Black jesus
Some say that one day
Oh well, I go out, drunk as hell
Waiting to fade, cause black Jesus sees
Just as this world treats its seeds, its young
Hit us until we're silly for fun, why run?
Then I say "Fuck this whole world, bitch", out of breath
Time is running, our minds click, until we pass out
Goin 'all out, route overboard for influence
Everyone plays for the same to see us, black Jesus
We believed in you
For everything you do
I just want to let you know how we feel
Black jesus
We believed in you
For everything you do
I just want to tell you what you want to say
Black jesus
We believed in you
For everything you do
I just want to let you know how we feel
Black jesus
Against all odds, I'm still here, nigga
O.P.D. -- than??!
Aiyyy, I have to get my accessories for 2Pacalypse
When this album comes out, niggas can kiss my ass
Did you think I would fall?
I present to you my criminal team
Treach, A.D., Apache, Essential
Above the law, Lench Mob, the subway, the digital subway scrolls and we in this bitch
You have to deal with me on a whole new level motherfucker
Because they pay me
And the more you try to keep niggas away from me
Extra special thanks to my nigga Big John Major
And there is a ghetto in every city and a black in every ghetto
Motherfucker we are unstoppable
And I'm not going to live!
The day i met you
I saw strength
And I knew from that point on
That you were pure, woman
I want smiles to replace the pain
What have you found in the past
And since it was strength, that attracted me to you
It will take strength to last
My negative side will try to change you
But please fight it with your aura
It will be your strength that keeps us both standing
While others around us fall
Black woman, black woman, black woman
Black woman, black woman, ohhhh black woman
I want smiles to replace the pain
What have you found in the past
And since it was strength, that attracted me to you
It will take strength
So it lasts
My negative side will try to change you
But please
Fight with your aura
While others around us fall
Keep us on our feet as things around us fall
It is your spirit, your strong and beautiful spirit.
Black woman, it's your beauty
It is your purity, it is you and all your love.
That makes us both stand
Black woman, you're pure, woman to me
Black woman, you are pure, joy to me.
The day I met you I saw strength
that you were a pure woman 2 me
possessing a spirit that was strong
what have you found in the past
and how was the force that attracted me 2 u
will take strength 2 will make it last
My negative side will try to change 2 u
while others around us fall
God has a plan, and the Bible reveals that wonderful plan.
Through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our savior.
And that Christ will return, someday soon
To develop the wonderful plan of eternity.
By accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and personal savior
Unless the Lord returns in the next seven days
See you next time here this week in Bible prophecy
2Pac, don't start that blasphemy here!
Makaveli, the new breed
And I remember what my parents told me
The new word, follow me
Strugglin ', known for rushing, yelling, "Fuck your feelings!"
I received advice from my father, all he said was this:
"Nigga, take off your ass if you plan to be rich!
There are ten rules to the game, but I'll share them with you two
You know niggas will hate you for what you do
Now, rule one: put your money in cash, M.O.B.
That's money on bitches, 'cause they breed envy
Keep your enemies close, nigga, look at your friends "
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled
Photo jewelry delivered to an innocent child
I never knew, in my life, I would live by these rules
Started as an outlaw, studying rules
Now, dad is not here, so I have to remember
Or face being written on the walls of my enemy
Promised that if I have a seed, I will guide him well
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
I have words for my comrades, listen and learn
It's nothing free, get back what you earned
This Thug Life will be my death
And I remember what my dad told me
Remember what my parents told me
Blasphemy!
Nuf to dem dat steal on behalf of da Lord
Dem a lie, but holding my bird on a cloud
(Remember what my parents told me)
Using the lord's name in vain
(Remember what my parents told me)
While people in the ghetto feel strong pain
We are already in hell, our idiots don't know
Everyone kissing my ass to go to heaven don't go
Put my soul into it, I'm fighting devil niggas every day
Back in the ghetto doing wild shit
Staring at the sun, don't pay
They say that Moses parted the Red Sea
Babylon be careful, come for the children of Pharoah
Retaliation, making legends of the shit we made
Still a liar, niggas in Jerusalem waiting for signs
Living on the Nile, as the water flows
It's just that raw shit, nigga, check it out (that raw shit)
And I remember what my dad told me
Remember what my dad told me
Blasphemy!
Nuff a dem robbery on behalf of the lord
(Remember what my parents told me)
Using the lord's name in vain
(Remember what my parents told me)
While people in the ghetto feel strong pain
(Than!)
The preacher wants me to be buried, why? Because I know he is a liar
Why do you have the minds of these children thinking they are evil?
As the preacher becomes strange, you say, "Honor the people of God."
Should we cry when the Pope dies? My request:
We should cry if they cry when we bury Malcolm X
Mom, tell me: am I wrong? Is God just another cop?
Hoping to hit my ass if I don't go pop?
Knowing very well that they will not feed us
In my brain, how can you explain time in B.C.?
Well he should understand the times in this criminal land
My hooligan nation, do what you have to do
But I know you have to change
Try to find a way to exit the game
I put this down and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? I leave this here
I put this down and hope God sees my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? And my people say
Nuff a dem robbery in the name of the lord
Dem a revealing lie, but holding a bird in a cloud
(Remember what my parents told me)
(Can't remember what my dad said to me, blasphemy)
While people in the ghetto feel strong pain
Our father who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name
Your kingdom come, your will be done
On earth as in heaven
Give us today our daily bread
As we give up our debts
While we forgive our debts
Do not let us fall into temptation.
But deliver us from evil
Because God is the kingdom and the power.
And the glory for ever and ever
In today's music news: The always controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias "Makaveli". Music fans are going nuts trying to reorganize other artists' street dates for fear that the movement between retail lists will be removed. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me that several less fortunate rappers have teamed up to conspire to assassinate the character not only from Mr. Shakur but also from Death Row Records. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's, excuse me, Makaveli's verbal assault against Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G. and several other rappers from New York. JAY-Z of "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little Whatever, and several other cheesy motherfuckers are understandably shaken by this release. The question everyone wants to know is: why did they start this nigger? 2Pac, rather Makaveli, was not available for comment, but released this statement:
It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches
Power and money, ridaz and punks
What side are you on?
* Heartbeat * * Shooting *
* Invading steps *
You niggas still breathing? Damn roaches
Aight, it's the foray into cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati style (all day) (in the ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Just shit, bring it in!
Let me introduce you first: Makaveli the Don
Niggas jerked like 5-0
My .45 is by my side when we ride, to survive
Plans to earn money, gun at hand, puffy pockets
Exposing snakes because they breed freely
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude sucks
You'll find me, look for trouble right behind me
My niggas outlaws to die for me, right?
I got to the scene, niggas ducking my guillotine gaze
I'm right there, each of my words is a damn nightmare
Take me high let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs, to die for all of you
Extreme poison, mercilessly when we are all in them
Cut them, to hell is where we send them
All my team trained to explode, ride or die
Lyrically murder the motherfuckers and I'm not going to cry
Two big holes, I call them "my black bitch eaters"
And not a moan until I'm gone
Thug Life running through my veins, so I'm strong
Bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh how do we make these niggas, but won't I cry?
I'm a Bad Boy killer, JAY-Z also dies
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas die for me? Yay-yay!
I want money, hoes, sex and grass
I won't rest until my road dog is free - pump first
We bombard first when we ride
We haven't even come to hurt anyone tonight
But it's my life or yours, and first I'm a bomb
We bombard first when we ride
Please reconsider before dying
We haven't even come to fight tonight
For so many days, in so many ways, we've been ducking
They deliver, but we're still some Bad Boy killers
I only have one house, I find myself stranded on death row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli to be the general
And I'm a soldier on a mission, sent to do what you'll never do
And that's for the cause, yeah I'll die for the cause
Better believe, if I leave this bitch, I'm dying with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a damn Nazi
I have a little question for that nigger who made "Paparazzi"
If you're not in this rap game for the damn money, well
E.D.I. Wicked, born worthless
That was until the day, I decided to bomb first, bitch!
Biatch! Come on, bring it down!
So we ride
Come on bring it
Pump first when we ride
Hey, get that nigger!
Your style as always, like you're rocking patent leather
Causing massive terror, you niggas lacking, they're not thorough
Half rapper, half drug dealer, you're telling fairy tales, Dunn
"King of New York" like you son of a bitch?
Get rich, even if it's hard
No warning signs, because I, my man took five
Now I'm the young man with 9 ready to put my time
I don't want to hear any shit tonight, believe me
Please reconsider before dying
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
G's and niggas thugs on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
Murder and pain come with the game if you choose to roll
Nigga don't sleep
Now in all my senses I mumble, I'm on a quest to provoke better shit
Nutt: so we have to live, we get ahead of these cowards
Half bitch niggas who love the taste of power
But he's just the chosen one, as we keep blowing shit
Even in the afterlife, we still explode tonight
Sure, that nigga should be more faithful
The state of war went to sleep, nobody left, now we are eating
Don't leave it, don't stop
Young Napoleon, Napoleon, it's on, it's on again
When a sip of liquor touched my liver, tell me if it will ever end
I'm tired of crying
Wake up to another dead man in the morning
Pray before I go to bed, I still woke up dreaming of lead
They want to talk and drink a beer and claim that Thug Life also
Murder and pain come with the game if you choose to roll
Dough kicks, putting holes in mothafuckas leaving hoes removed
Nigga lay you down when I crawl on a mission to send you six feet
Nigga don't sleep
First I explode in his body, like my weapons in varieties
Runnin 'wit' the real big teddies, you dumb fools try to be
But up front, making my passes rolling blunt
Hands on my nuts in a stunt car
Addicted to my nine, moving like a crime through time
Poppin 'niggas like pimples, nuttin' simple 'nigga over mine
Engrave a sketch, throwing all the punks at the intersections
Day after day, there's no easy way out on easy ways
Do not sleep
Walking dead down my back, passed out
In my bed and if I rest
How much do I want to bet how fast I fall?
The edge of my flat face, but fuck I'm a soldier
Wide, tired of living lies has me crazy
In mom's eyes, the drama side won't stop until I smoke them, powerful
So I'm drowning, floating, standing
Since these bitch niggas crawl, why the fuck should I sleep?
Dumpin 'on random mothafuckas, quickly
Precisely, they shouldn't speak ill of me
It had to be, a fucking murder I'm glad to be
The black man who made the murder so sad to see
With a big hole in the head, greeted by a thug (Nigga), there's no love
He dragged him off the asphalt, then went to the hills and brought him to his knees and blew him up.
He removed the cap and wrapped it in plastic.
He slid to the edge and threw his butt
Then he notified his entire family of this tragedy.
He killed them without asking me who did it
The catastrophe is how I left it and you won't see the last of me nigga
And I bet he got wet, don't sleep
Cause you're fucking with the truest black
I fucked it up with extendo saber (Ahh shit, haha)
Not with the mothafucka sticks, the game is over
When I enter the first zone, the worst known microphone stand
My Hummer rolls up, evacuating tied soldiers
Internal strategy, manifesting military styles
Casual tragedy when niggas fight me
My prophesied prediction, change and move positions
Separated from his gun and his bitch, and watch them start snorting
I personify this thug living; Hell or prison
My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world, me and the mafia to get married
It seems horrifying screams pierce the darkness
Just as suspected, a trick bitch where your heart is
Mark, watch the niggas fall when I call their name
We Outlawz hold your head niggas anyway
We're still hitting until no one is left
Do not sleep
Murder and pain come with the game if you choose to roll
Dough kicks, putting holes in mothafuckas leaving hoes removed
Nigga lay you down when I crawl on a mission to send you six feet
Nigga don't sleep
It's nothing more than a gangsta party (come on come on)
It's nothing more than a gangsta party (Sing that shit, sing that shit)
It's nothing more than a gangsta party (2Pac)
Perfect picture, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention is to enrich myself
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fucking friend
Sho 'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
Because they put me on the run
Now I'm back in the room, waiting for the result
So I get smart and I get defensive and that shit
And organize a Million March for a gangsta shit
Now they have us tied up
Two billionaire motherfuckers catching cases
Bitches get ready to launch, shit is about to fall
Snoop and me about to clown
I'm losing my religion, I'm cruel to these feces pigeons
You may be immersed in this game, but you are missing the rules
I have a well called Petey, she Nigerina
I have a house in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I have a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and make it all legal
And be picked up by my young friend at the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
See, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker
Now go on while we ride
Shit the rest, two of the best on the west side
Niggas has been dying for years, so how could they blame us?
I never stop rescuing them (Westcoast G's)
Another order, two of the most wanted in the United States.
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
(Nothing but a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
(Nothing but a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
It's nothing more than a gangsta party
(Nothing but a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, set me free on the streets
And keep what's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is greed
Better get ready when you cowards fuck me
I burst and run, these niggas must be crazy, what?
No goddamn motherfuckers can't fade thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now it disappears
Lean in the presence of a chief player
You have to have papers in this world
You do your job every day
Let me tell you about life and the way it is
You see, we live by the leash, so we die by the leash, children
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I have a discard
They wonder how I live with five shots.
Niggas it's hard to kill on my block
Currency and mass schemes
Affiliated with scammers, so we did
There are no answers to the questions, I'm trying to get up
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted
Do gangsters handle this motherfucker?
(Hell yeah)
(Hell yeah)
(Hell yeah)
West side at this fucking party
West side at this fucking party
(It's a gangsta party
(It's a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
West side, west side
(It's a gangsta party
West side, west side
(It's a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
Death row
(It's a gangsta party
It's nothing more than a fucking gangsta party)
Outlawz in this motherfucker
Deathrow in this motherfucker
Keep awake, keep representing
The lyrics of this song have not yet been released. Check back once the song has been released.
Come on break them something
Yeah let's break them something (with that funky funky style)
Come on, get 'em out of something
Yeah let's break them something (with that funky funky style)
Red light, green light, one, two, three
Tell me why O.P.D. sweating
Is it because of the greater grip I'm making?
Is it because of the fact that Pac is not faking it?
Better think before drawing black
I'm not the one who bites your tongue, 2 Pacalypse will smoke again
Taking out the police team
Don't make fun of me, just suck me
Better talk how you walk when we swing them
Yes, little square we can throw them
I have a gang that you can bring
Look at me, pop, pop, bang, boom, ping 'em
Big D's in the house, the crazy horse passes
Cause they can't fade, yeah
(Yes !, yes Mopreme Shakur, thug life, outlaw)
Kill a nigga, kill a nigga (strictly representing)
Come on break them something
Yeah let's break them something (with that funky funky style)
Kill a black kill a black
Come on, get 'em out of something
Yeah let's break them something (with that funky funky style)
Dub-c and got me into some freestyle shit huh
So nigga go and run as hard as you can and take cover
And I can't stand them niggas on [?]
Fuck a dancer, I'm waiting because my team doesn't dance
Crazier than a serial killer on a hoe ride
And I don't know about you, but I'm down to represent
Packin 'up all these niggas who are dissipin' the underground
Motherfucker, I dissolve them in wax
Oops, there goes that ghetto mentality
The same reason you never watch my video on your TV
Because we don't say what they want us to say
Fuck the beat and the blues and the police are dumb too
You niggas can't stop me if I gave your jaw a free steel, still you couldn't drop me
So don't try to sneak up on that tip
'Cause they'll kick that ass, you quick bitch
The shoots will be knocked down
Dub-C bringing noise from mother fucking underground
Kill a black kill a black
Come on, get 'em out of something
Yeah let's break them something (with that funky funky style)
Kill a nigga, kill a nigga
Come on, get 'em out of something
Yeah let's break them something (with that funky funky style)
Wicked, wicked, Oak Town-style
Wicked, wicked, Oak Town-style
Wicked Money B, I'm that hateful dodger
(Who is bad?)
I am the worst evil as I want to be
Stop if you want, but don't you dare stand in front of me
Daddy Mack cheating, what did you do then, all the shit
Well here's a little more cock for you to suck on
And all these years that I'm rapping
Styles I will show
If I find you, you will hide in my face
I'll be in it like a [?]
Stingin 'like a bumblebee
Fuck the humble
I have this resistance to be in the microphone
Mashin 'in the pose with the stylist's boots
I'm about to catch a lump in my pants
And the bigger the butt, the bigger the walnut
What mistrust
Can i catch a bum
Lying in the cut, like a panther on the prowl
So agile
Don't ask scoop
You're not a now
But I will tell MC how, we should
Take your time, take yourself, take your time
Mc take your time, before you start the rhyme
Take your time, take yourself, take your time
So are you Filthy McNasty ?, rappin 'too fast
Ask me, I say we slow down and flow and roll our ass
Peace to Down W, Big D, 2Pac and Mack
Sideways to your mom's house
Kill a black kill a black
Come on, get 'em out of something
Yeah let's break them something (with that funky funky style)
Come on, get 'em out of something
I switched the nigga out of respect before he played me
Get out of that fucking fool, you can save them
And if you think I'm fucking around, hear the gun go off
I have to break your ass, something of that reality
Niggas don't know about D through E through B
The shit in the microphone that motherfuckers can't fuck
Do you want something to play with?
Heat your ass like gum
While I push the clip pump pump
From a woman's perspective
As I pump and trample huh
To make a type of fly have to tremble, they grumble
Money B and W.C. the D.E.B down with the motherfucker S.T
Who will be the last motherfucker to breathe?
Tell me nigga tell me
Who will be the last motherfucker to breathe?
The enemies give me reasons
Bustin 'my automatic rounds
Catch them while they sleep
Stressed but busta free
The enemies give me reasons
To be the last motherfucker to breathe
Bustin 'my automatic rounds
Catch them while they sleep
Now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
I couldn't rest, nah nigga, I was stressed
Made me crawl around the corners, buddy, sleeping in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage in this troublesome block, call the police
A black thug yelling 'Westside, bustin' Double Glocks
Hitting corners in my Chevy Suburban
The liquor made me drive on the sidewalk
Hand on the steering wheel, turning
Just let me live on the streets cause there is no peace for me in jail
I just launched them on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside, Outlaw, Bad Boy Killer
Complete my mission, my competition is no longer fighting
I murdered all those busts, now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
Stressed but busta free
To be the last motherfucker to breathe
Now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
For all my missing soldiers we burn the earth
Outlaw around the world, we pack the block
Shooting rocks at the boy, I'll go back to find Pac
Back here, too many jails down here
Why are you acting like you don't listen to me?
Young nobleman, outlaw until these motherfuckers kill me
Now, we were raised "to fuck this life", my mistakes, my rights
Holding tight, with death in sight
And the darkness is my light, I'm cynical, I sleep walking like a real
Walk around town with a pound full of sour food
I came a long way from my day of birth
Dead far away where there is war game
Fuck friends! I'll say, I'd rather die for my A-K
Stressed but busta free
The enemies give me reasons
To be the last motherfucker to breathe
Catch them while they sleep
Now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
Speaking of a bad day, I live such a life
It's serious, and I'm losing my hair, blessed is a thug
Catch me, I'm falling, I'm broke and
I learned to like myself like that when I was still in mom
The side of the city where the devil flees
And I'm still totally lost, they want me to face this
But I am trained in Makaveli, plain and simple
We're number one motherfucker to do it again
We move to kill, to eat, to hold steel
Hold the wheel
I'm about to give these niggas something they can feel
Fakin 'real, but we raw and uncut
And we still breathe and we still breathe ...
Tell them! Nigga, tell them! (And we still breathe ...)
Stressed but busta free
The enemies give me reasons
To be the last motherfucker to breathe
Catch them while they sleep
Now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
Stressed but busta free
The enemies give me reasons
To be the last motherfucker to breathe
Bustin 'my automatic rounds
Catch them while they sleep
Now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
Yes
Who will be the last motherfucker to breathe?
Tell me nigga, (tell me)
Who will be the last motherfucker to breathe?
Stressed, but without bust
Enemies give me reasons to be the last motherfucker to breathe
Catch them while they sleep, now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
Bustin ', my automatic rounds
Catch them while they sleep, now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
I woke up to fifty enemies plotting my death
I couldn't rest, nah nigga, I was stressed
It made me crawl around corners, Homie sleeping in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage in this troublesome block, call the police
Hitting corners in my Chevy Suburban
The liquor made me drive on the sidewalk, my hand on the steering wheel spinning
Bless me father, I'm a sinner, I'm living in hell
Just let me live on the streets, cause there's no peace for me in jail
Gaining worldwide exposure
I just launched them on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside Outlaw; Bad Boy Killer, huh?
Complete my mission, my competition is no longer fighting
I murdered all those busts now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
Stressed, but without bust
Enemies give me reasons to be the last motherfucker to breathe
Catch them while they sleep, now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
Enemies give me reasons to be the last motherfucker to breathe
Bustin ', my automatic rounds
Catch them while they sleep, now I'm the last motherfucker to breathe
Jumping on my four-door Chevy, in this game, I'm still heavy
I promise not to run fast
You're fucking with the bitch Don, I run shit, with a clip that Mr. Makaveli is quick to make, go back to TV
I fuck a bitch like I'm psychotic, I think that's what they tell me
Damn, I don't fight fair
Open fire, because my wish is to ride
I got all the niggas signed with Bad Boy, praying he dies
They couldn't see the coward in their eyes until they died
They wonder why, they head
Helpless, when my squad hits, hard niggas
Brenda has a baby
I heard Brenda has a baby, but Brenda barely has a brain
Too bad, the girl can barely spell her name
"That is not our problem, it depends on Brenda's family"
Well let me show you how it affects our entire community.
And his father was a drug addict, putting death in his arms.
It's sad because I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just because you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation.
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation.
Brenda got a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's see how the joy ends
Who really didn't care to see, or care if she
As long as the check came, they got the first dibs
Now Brenda's belly is getting bigger
He is twelve years old and has a baby.
In love with an abuser, who is sexing her
And still, she thinks he will be with her forever.
And dream of a world where the two are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby alone
I had it on the bathroom floor and I didn't know it, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
He didn't realize how much the baby's eyes had.
Now the baby is in the garbage heap, screaming
Mom says you make me lose my salary
There are social workers here every day.
Now Brenda has to make her way
She can't go with her family, they won't let her stay
Without money, babysitter, she couldn't keep a job.
So what's next? There is nothing left to sell
So she sees sex as a way to leave hell
She's paying the rent, so she really can't complain.
Prostitute, found murdered, and Brenda's name is
Hears
Look at me
Wipe them scared
Why is it that we have to be?
(Watch your back)
Contacting niggas in the cemetery
Funeral homes
Seeing all my friends buried
All the worried moms and shit
Why is there so much black brothazine dyne?
One day we can all be together smoking weed taking drugs
Where is your family?
Fuck a black love
Now it's time to
Did you cross the nigger who put food inside your stomach?
Point The Pussy To The Crowd Time To Pay
Past discretions, you never learned your lessons in this deadly war
Let's explore the possibilities, those niggas are killing me
Head all busted
About this black trick that I trusted, now is
And, never in my deepest thoughts did I think that he could turn against me
So many to choose from
Niggas close to me, I wonder how I lose them (how I lose one)
Maybe because I put them on the podium before me (Oh yeah)
I used to think that it should be
Until the niggas cross me, now it's different (different now)
Bitches wait till I get cold (turn it on)
And told a shameless lie (lie)
But still I never asked why (Upload) (Why?)
Because now I have my eyes on you (I have my eyes on you)
Before my crew remember how it goes
Now you want to chase
The B.D Buck just because you're jealous like a motherfucker (Jealous like a
Motherfucker)
Every man has the right to decide his own destiny.
The end is
And in this judgment there is no bias
So arm in arms (arm in arms)
Overcome all problems
Your fight is my fight (your fight)
Your fight (Your fight) (Your fight is my fight)
Your fight (your life)
I showed you love but you are the same one who tried to fuck me
You see, snitch is a deadly epidemic disease.
Departure
Drop your gun, take your time, set your mind free
Forget about crime, and everything will disappear in time.
My information strictly based on niggas faces
Previous cases with the law, plus a life of raw life
Every man has the right to decide his own destiny.
And in this judgment there is no bias
So arm in arms (arm in arms)
We fight to live and fight (Fight to live and fight)
And that's the only way to
Your fight is my fight (your fight)
Your fight is my fight (your fight)
Let's do it now
Your fight is my fight (your fight)
Let's do it now
Let's do it now
My fight is your fight, we could do this all day and all night
So I tell you what, One Nation, we are going to establish this plantation
This base, and we will take it to the real enemy
The one who is not my friend
The first, the war continues, the fight continues
There is no way to survive in the city, it's a shame
Niggas die from my hollow point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or die? Is what i wonder
I pulled my gun out the window screaming, "Lord, come get me"
Am I sick or am I just another victim?
Downloading my clip, I'm watching every bullet spit when I kick them
Niggas die from automatic shooting
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, all the friends got to heaven before me
He had a fucking order but he didn't go to court
Damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for anything, come on
Bullet the brain!
Bullet the brain!
But don't blame me, blame the flickering flame
Bullet the brain!
Bullet the brain!
Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it
And spit it back at your racist faces
And hypocrites who think the same but say nothing
You Liberaces, Versaces and you Nazis
Look at me, cause you thought you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers want to judge me because you are not me
You will never stop me, I'm high speed and you explode me
I came to save these new generations of babies.
To grow to praise me, I'm driving them crazy
This is how I got this whole nation to hold me
And you fleeting if you think I'm going to admit that I'm wrong
I paralyze any hypocritical critic I'm sick in
And this song is for any child who is teased
A sick song to retaliate
Bullet the brain!
Bullet the brain!
Bullet the brain!
But don't blame me
Nigga go to hell with my finger on the trigger
Bullet the brain!
Bullet the brain!
Bullet the brain!
A young black man trying to succeed in these difficult streets
I'm on my knees begging please come and save me
Everyone made a black man go mad!
I have my three-five-seven I can't control it
Screaming motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, aww shit
Thug Life motherfucker, quick duck
Now i'm wrong if i am don't worry
Why do or die doing drugs until they bury me
Let a nigga be tied up, fucked up and drugged
With my hands on the trigger, black thug
Stressing Out Like A Damn Drug Dealer
And even on the darkest nights, I'm a bully for life
I have the heart to fight now
Mom raised a collector why cry
That's just ghetto life, do it or die
Bury me a g
Remember me? Life as a g
These money-making activities are killing me
I'm trying to ball but this alcohol makes me throw
Paranoid as I am against the world
My only question: when I travel I will be assassinated, victim of some homicide, did I deserve it?
My life is full of misery
Intoxicated I can hardly see
I can't sleep dreaming that someone is killing me
Am i sane
My life is pain and I'm stressed
Brothaz is stumbling
They open fire where I rest
Waiting for the death
But I still live every breath
It won't be for me
Retaliate every death
Let's make them bleed
Because doing or dying is the only way
And although I pray
I can see you get sick every day
And I don't have time for snitches
I have to keep my mind on my money and my riches
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
Look, I don't have time for snitches
I have to keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die I don't care
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
But when the ??? jump from the front ??? I will do my thing
I have problems, so I locked myself up when my parents were killed.
They shout "Peace!", But they have all passed away
Just bury me a G ...
In the alley, I get paid for the way I play (what?)
Remembering, remembering my teenagers
A young G, charging for drug demons
Fuckin 'cash I did
Nigga, what's the feeling of working hard if you never play?
I hurry, I stay out until dawn
And coming home at 6 o'clock in the morning
Hand on my Glock, eyes on the prize
And I'll be throwing the dice, pulling the niggas out the door
Completely caught, drunk again
Pour some liquor for friends in the pen '
Tell them niggas from thug life to be like big pimps
Compliance with the rules was not made for simp
Keep my finger on my Mac hair
The crack game is not shit
Niggas stumbling in this rap game, bury me a G
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
(and I) I don't have time for bitches
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
And I will stay tied
My Mac-11 makes my nuts bigger
I keep my finger on the trigger for you jealous niggas
I wonder why a crazy motherfucker and why I'm worried
When I see a cemetery full of dead friends
Mom told me "son, don't lie"
And mom is in the back smoking crack and a nigga wants to die
I can't cry because I'm crazy
Drowned, nigga puffing on that fucked up indo
And in the back of my mind, I know that I'm wrong
Alcohol makes a young son of a bitch think he's dancing
On the phone, trying to bone because I miss you
Back on the streets I'm losing focus
I have no hope, friends are dying for some shit
The crack game is not shit
I don't have time for bitches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
I don't have time for bitches
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
And motherfuckers catching drug cases
I put my Glock off my waist and keep a thug face
Even on a good day! I have to be tied
Living in my hood, hey!
Niggas will spray caps
And everyone wants to go to heaven, nobody wants to pray
So I stay in my AK
Killing niggas who oppose me
It's time to make my getaway
I hid in the back streets
I couldn't let the police kick me
I have to be calm, I'm depressed
I have that ya-yo moving around the pound so
When the police prove me, fuck the judge
I have a friend who will join me, direct love
Keep my finger on my mac man
The crack game is not shit
Niggas stumbling in this rap game, bury me a G
I don't have time for bitches
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
I don't have time for bitches
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
Trapped in the fool, Tanqueray got a tall black
Just because I screwed, doesn't mean I trust her
Now my pagers vibrate, I can't sleep
So I'm complaining to the ho's house, hitting Isley
Bitch recognized the game and started laughing
Now I'm all in the guts and shit
Praying that a nigga doesn't twist too fast
Cause I'll fuck up and get up, I'll let you know
I'll be a 10 minute brother for $ 2 ho
Many hoes go crazy like shit
Keep my finger on my mac man
The crack game is not shit
Niggas stumbling in this rap game, bury me a G
I don't have time for bitches
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
I don't have time for bitches
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
(cause) I don't have time for bitches
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
(cause) I don't have time for bitches
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
(cause) I don't have time for bitches
I have to keep my mind on my damn riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mom don't cry, bury me a G
Now I don't have time for bitches, bitches, bitches ...
Californian love
California knows how to have fun
We keep it rocking, we keep it rocking
Now let me welcome you all to the Wild Wild West
An untouchable state like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a bullet in your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in sex city
The state where you never find an empty dance floor
Lean money-making machines that serve demons
I've been in the game for 10 years making rap tunes
Since the honeys wore Sassoon
Now it's 95 and they look at me and look at me
Everything is fine, from Diego to the bay
Raise a finger if you feel the same
Dre put it down for Californ-i-a
California knows how to have fun
California knows how to have fun (yes they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good old watts
In the city, the city of Compton.
Shake, shake, baby
Shake, shake, mom
Shake it, Cali
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
On bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
As soon as I enter the scene, I hear hoochie screams
Only in Cali, where we mutiny, we do not meet, to live and die.
In Los Angeles we use Chucks, not Ballys (yes, it's true)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and riding is what we do
Famous because we throw grams
Around the world, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Pounding and grinding like a slow jam
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back
Cali is where they left their mack; Give me Love!
California knows how to have fun (yes they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city, the city of Compton.

Yes it's correct
West coast west coast

(It's nothing more than a gangsta party)
Ahh shit, you're already screwed

You put two of the most wanted in America
In the same damn place at the same time?
(It's nothing more than a gangsta party)
Ha ha ha ha you all niggas about to feel this
(It's nothing more than a gangsta party)
Break the champagne glasses and the damn condoms
Do you have one on us?
(It's nothing more than a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters
Perfect picture, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention is to enrich myself
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fucking friend
Sure, I keep my hand on my gun
Because they put me on the run
But at the same time, it seems like they're trying to take mine
So I get smart and I get defensive and that shit
And organize a Million March for a gangsta shit
So now they have us tied
Two billionaire motherfuckers catching cases
Bitches get ready to shoot down, shit is about to fall
Snoop and me about to clown
I'm losing my religion, I'm cruel to these feces pigeons
You may be immersed in this game, but you are missing the rules
Niggas act like savages, they go out looking for cabbage
I have nothing but love for my niggas who live luxuriously
I have a well called Petey, she Nigerina
I have a house in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I have a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and make it all legal
And let yourself be carried away by the little friend of the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
Now go on while we ride
Shit the rest, two of the best on the west side
And i can make you famous
Niggas has been dying for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a serious crime
I never stop rescuing these damn G's
Another order, two of the most wanted in the United States.
Party Party

Diamonds that shine like stealing Liberace
Everything is fine, from Diego to the bay

Flossing, but be careful, we collide with other crews

The blind gazes of a million pairs of eyes
Looking hard but you won't notice
That they will never see the P!
You must go blind
Give me my money in piles and tie my bitches with dime figures
I must see my enemies defeated
I caught them as they got up and frayed
Open fire now those niggas bleed
Look at me in the flesh and taste and fly your chest
Straight west, don't let yourself fly
My adversaries cry like hoes, open and close like doors
Are you friend or foe? Nigga, don't you know?
Stressed me on death row
I've seen money, but baby I gotta get more
Bail is paid now, nigga, look what the hell did
Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire
Pile of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player getting high
And when I'm shooting for niggas I can't see myself!
The gazes of a million pairs of eyes
You can not see me
I've had the news that these nervous square motherfuckers
Saying they can come with us, but imagine me getting
My own mom says I'm kicked out
My lyrics hit like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what! It's nothing more than a party when we killed
And there he was, a young black man with a heart, he had nothing to lose
Pulling my gun on them fools, you know the rules
Hitting the bitches where they need it the most
Money and grass, Alizé and Hennessy.
To my locked up niggas thugs: give me testimony
The life of a boss player, fuck what you thought
Die like a bitch when my album goes out; Blacks can't see me!
Niggas can't see me
Can't see me
Where did he go, George?
Where did he go?
Where did he go?
You niggas made a mistake
The thug niggas have come and it's judgment day
Hello friend, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that got lost, they won't kill me
I can make a motherfucker move, rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor, black thug, quick to bite hoes
Fuck off with 2Pac and see how good a nigger's goal is
I'm just a rich motherfucker by the way
If this rappin 'brings me money, then I'm rapping until I'm paid
I'm turning green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I scream at these hoes and I see how many I can get through
Look at the star and visualize my debut
Don't be a silly motherfucker because it's crazy after dark
Where the real thugs see your heart; Blacks can't see me!
Hey, check this out: stay away from his cock
Niggas can't see me
Right before your eyes, I'll disappear from here
You niggas can't see me
You can not see me
I know it's hard nigga, I'm all in your face
But you still can't see me
Everything in your range, but niggas can't see me
20/20 vision will not display
All those glasses won't help you figure it out
You blinded, blinded, can't you see me
You can not see me
Don't believe everything you read!
Alizé and grass
You can't see me, right before your own eyes
You won't even visualize, you can't see me
Dr. Dre all day, 2Pac
Niggas can't see me
This is for you, big baby
Cause you idiot niggas can't see me
Niggas can't see me
You can not see me
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
You will not see me
Yes, you see me first, not now
You want to see me, but won't you?
Come see me, but you can't
Oh you can't see me
Right between your eyes and you'll never notice
Visualize what you can't see
Yeah niggas you can't fuck with us
Tell them to fuck off
But even cuter behind the barrel of my six shooters Oh
You look worried because I'm not buried
The punks are in a hurry because I throw bursts doing mothafuckas, running
Come feel the taste of my single
And how's that for black history?
I get tied up and I love getting into the jargon that breaks misery Ha
Because being a black means you love blacks
But how could you love niggas if you try drug niggas?
You bastards need your caps peeled off
Because when blacks kill blacks we get trapped and that's real
It is time to be more realistic for the young, the black, and the gifted.
And uh
Until my people get up
No shit bursts, just pop clips instead of marching, let's rip
Shit
Some say the government will monitor me
But they can't stop me
I'm fucking evil with people like my gang
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot a man, but nothing will stop the plan of the real blacks
Some say the government will monitor me
But they can't stop me
I'm fucking evil with people like my gang
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot a man, but nothing will stop the plan of the real blacks
How should I advocate? Forever thuggin 'on a quest to get G's
Fleeing enemies from the days of a seed
I'm under pressure, stress will make me drink
Thinking niggas after me, too paranoid to blink
I wonder why the police don't want to see me stacking G's
After a beach, but I won't let them capture me
I must thank the Lord for the herb and nicotine
I can't sleep, I close my eyes, I see evil things
I keep my gun by my bed, one in the chamber
Concerned about the murder, my life is in danger
I'm probably wrong, but I'll never know until I'm gone
From the sewer where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Some say the government will monitor me
But they can't stop me
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot a man, but nothing will stop the plan of the real blacks
But they can't stop me
I'm fucking evil with people like my gang
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot a man, but nothing will stop the plan of the real blacks
Fuck with the skinhead ass niggas
Fuck the police and the clan, this is what we do to the damn Clan, let's move
They got me mobbin like I'm loc'ed
And ready to put on my slug
Load my clip and put on my damn gloves
I'm not afraid to shoot these suckas if they test me
Motherfuckers bust with paaassion
I'm crazy and I drink Hennessey and I get high
In search of my enemies, I don't want to die
Tell me why? Because this stress is becoming important
A fifty dollar in the face with my razor
What can I do but be a bully until I die and go?
Keep my brain in the game and keep my head strong
These crazy bastards want to kill me while I sleep
But will they be able to see?
Constant beatings on the streets
And I'll be dancing loc
Don't let them worry you
I was born to raise hell, a gut nigga
Word to Mutha I am touched
I'm kicking the dust
I'm on the filthy bad scene
Until they kill me
I will be living this life
I know you feel me
There is a lot of pain
Some say the government will monitor me
But they can't stop me
Some say the government will monitor me
But they can't stop me
I'm fucking evil with people like my gang
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot a man, but nothing will stop the plan of the real blacks
Knocked down OBSTACLES placed on the road
Can you feel Pantha's pride?
The seed must grow independently
from the fact that it's planted in stone
You CAN'T c pride in panthas
as they unify as one
Flower blooms with shine
and outshines the ray of the sun
This song is dedicated
To the mothers and children of the revolution.
From 2Pac to Afeni Shakur
And many many more
This is for you
You can see ... the pride of the panther
While she nurtures .. her young completely alone
It is the seed ... that must grow independently
From the fact that it's been planted in stone
It is the seed ... that must come to harvest
It is the tree ... that must grow for love
Can you see the pride in the panther?
Knocking down obstacles
On the path of career progression?
While caring for her calf, alone?
Can't you see the pride of the panthers?
How do they unify, as one?
The flower blooms with shine and
Eclipse all rays of the sun
Stays bright like the rays of the sun
It takes place like the rays of the sun
Shine like a new day started
Can you see the pride in the panther?
How does it shine in splendor and grace?
On the path of career progression
Can you see the pride in the panther?
While she cares for her young girl alone?
The seed must grow independently
From the fact that it's been planted in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers?
How do they unify as one?
The flower blooms, with shine.
And outshines all the rays of the sun
It takes place like a new day started (uh-huh)
Shine like the sun's rays (ha)
And it stays high as a new day has begun
Holds high as a new day has begun
Carry out like the rays of the sun
Keep on like a new day started, say
Shine like the rays of the sun!
Stay high as a new day has begun, say
Shine like the rays of the sun!
Stay high as a new day has begun, yeah
Carry out like a new day started, let's say (come on)
Shine like the sun's rays say (come on)
Hold it high as the new day begins to say
BRIGHT BRIGHTNESS LIKE THE SUN RAYS (whoo!)
Shine like the sun's rays (yeah)
Carry on like the rays of the sun (huh)
A new day started started started started started
It started it started it started .. hoo!
He said ... power to the people! (Power to the people)
He said ... power to the people! (Power to the people)
He said ... love is people's power (LOVE)
Love is the power of people (LOVE)
Love is the power of people (when everything else falls apart)
Love is the power of people (love must prevail)
Love is the power of the people.
Every revolutionary act is an act of love.
And love is the engine of the revolution.
I love you all, like 'Pac loved you all
How Afeni loved 'Pac, how we love Afeni
* Poems written by Shakur as ~ performed by other artists
Every revolutionary act is said to be an act of love.
All power to the people
I said P is for power, A is for action
The N-T because now is the time to do it
See that the H is for the heart and the E for the effect
The R holds her down at the end out of respect
Who I am? A panther
What I got I got PRIDE, what I want to be FREE
Who I am? A panther
Who I am? A panther
Put your hands up in the air if you feel like me
Can you see the pride of the panther?
How does it shine in splendor and grace?
Knocking down obstacles
On the path of career progression
Can you see the pride in the panther?
While caring for her calf, alone?
The seed must grow independently
From the fact that it's planted, in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers?
How do they unify, as one?
The flower blooms, with shine.
It eclipses, like the sun
Shines like the sun
Bring light, like the sun
P is for power, A for action
The N-T because now is the time to do it
See that the H is for the heart and the E for the effect
Who I am? A panther
Who I am? A panther
What I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE
What I got I got PRIDE, what I want to be FREE
Put your hands up in the air if you feel like me
Who I am? A panther
What I got I got SOUL, what I got I got LOVE
What I got I got PRIDE, what I want to be FREE
This song is dedicated to all who live and die from the struggle.
Panthers, children of the Panthers, or all those who fight for
Free minds, free souls, free bodies ... for freedom
And love ... love ... love is the engine of the revolution.
How are you? It is 2Pac. Can you escape
Let me come throw you
(You know I have a man)
(Of course it will matter)
Let me take you to lunch, I'll have you back before he gets home, before anyone sees
(I can't, he won't leave me
Aww come on! Pleeeeeease ...
(Nah)
Why did you put on glasses?
Since I met you I could spy on the pressure
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Telephone conversations late at night, would it be okay?
I don't want to take all your time, be next in line
Tell me your size, let me find things for you
I can see that you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love making
Precision news will prepare you
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the image is clearing up
I tell you to leave it, and you tell me to keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just want to take you home
I wonder if I should leave you alone
And find a woman of mine
All friends tell me you don't deserve it
I contemplate, but in my heart I know you're worth it
Ebony, can you get away?
Come on ... come on ... can you get away?
So much pressure in the air (I know, I know)
And I can't escape (just for a while, love)
I'm not happy here (I know it's hard but can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air
(Come on man, get out of there, can you get away?)
And I can't escape (Do you love him?)
Could it be my destiny to be alone?
I'm not looking for these hoochies that are on me
‘Because they are false
‘Because I can say that my life with you would be delicious
Even though I have your fingers, I have to fight to resist
Go slowly when it's my chance not to lose it
You blow me kisses when he's not looking
Now your heart has taken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he shudders
Come see tomorrow
Let him know that I care, that someone is there for his fight
It is up to me, when I have needs or have problems
I want to give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, there is no time to lose
We can connect in the store. Can you escape
So much pressure in the air (I know it is)
And I can't escape (Yes, you can)
I'm not happy here (You're not happy, huh? Can you escape?)
So much pressure in the air (I know ... is it hitting you?)
I'm not happy here (is he throwing you around the house?)
I sit here remembering and hope you hear me
In a position to push and offer competition
Now because now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What I can do? I don't want to lose you to this fool
‘Because if it touches you, I have some drama for that busta
I don't want to rush you, but make a quick decision
No one knows, who does it control last?
Before asking, I hope you see that I am sincere
And even if you stay with him today, I'm still here
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me, can you get away?
And i can't escape
I'm not happy here
(Let me take you away, all I want to know, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (man)
And I can't escape (Of course you can escape)
I'm not happy here
(If you really wanted to escape, you could escape)
You don't have to go through all this drama and stress
With this old half man, do you know what I'm saying?
Where you have to give up your lifestyle for everything
He hit you and shit; look how you look!
You too fucking raw to be with that nigga
You know what I'm saying?
Shake that fool to the left
You know what I'm saying? You need to be first class
Seeing what this world has to offer
I'm not going to, you know what I'm saying?
The emergency room, earning points
Can you take me from here?
Can you take me from here?
I'm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I need to get away, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can you see the pride of the panther?
As it grows in splendor and grace
Knocking down obstacles placed on the road,
of your career progression.
Can you see the pride of the panther?
while she cares for her young man completely alone
The seed must grow independently
from the fact that it's planted in stone.
since they are unified as one.
The flower blooms with shine,
and outshines the rays of the sun.
Hahahahahaha, hello man
Word hahahahaha
You had problems from the beginning, you taught me many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this started, we were the perfect couple, maybe
We had some problems but we worked on it, and now
The arguments are getting loud, I mean
But I can't help but walk just a little
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned on being a man, it just wasn't me
But now I'm looking for compromise, in other weapons
I want to protect you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you have me stressed
As soon as I open the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be, you're killing me with your jealousy
Now my ambition is to be free
I can't breathe, because as soon as I leave, it's like a trap
Guilty feet have no rhythm, they suck love
Although it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool, a suck for love
I should have known better than to cheat on a friend
And waste the opportunity they've given me, a suck for love
So I will never dance again
The way that I danced with you
Just when I thought I broke up and I feel happy
I don't want to fall for that, but in this case, what could I do? So now i'm back
To make you promises, trying to keep it
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me going and continue?
Trying to be strong and in the process, keep you moving
I'm about to lose my composure, I'm getting closer
To pack and leave notes, and get ghosts
To clear my head, I feel low, losing control
My heart is saying: go away, oh, what a tangle of cloth we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You get calls in the house, I guess you cheat
That's all I need to hear because I'm leaving, I'm out of the game
You'll never see me again, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheating, I'm sucking for love
I will never dance again, hahahaha, that is correct
Guilty feet have no rhythm, they stink for love
Although it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool, a suck for love
I should have known better than to cheat on a friend
And waste the opportunity they've given me, a suck for love
So I will never dance again
As you sit and pray, waiting for the beatings to go away
It used to be love, happiness and company
Remember when I treated you well
I took you to the hills, out of the evils of the ghetto chapel.
You and me a happy home, when it was on
I loved to call it mine
I should have seen you was a problem, but I was lost, caught in your eyes
Worried about being thrown, no need to lie
Don't worry about it, we can do it now, I'm under pressure
Make a decision because I'm waiting, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone having secret conversations, huh?
I want to take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a suck for love
Hahahaha that's right, it stinks for love
A suck for love, a suck for love
Turn off the lights from the top muthafuckin
I'm with 2pac in this bitch
Yes
Capital R shit, all shit
("It's nothing more than a gangsta")
Las Vegas, Crooked I, Tha Row mix, bitch
Perfect picture, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention is to enrich myself
With the (S-N double-O-P, Dogg), my fucking friend
You are a cold black in those hoes
And go on, I have both heaters on and I'm ready to ride
Whoever is ready for the meat, better get ready to hide
75 shots for whoever survives
Yeah niggas leave the scene but they're never alive
I'm in a cut with a whore up
I have a pop-up plot, don't upload
How are you, Pac?
So now they have us tied
Two billionaire motherfuckers catching cases
Bitches get ready to launch, shit is about to fall
Me and (Snoop) about to clown
I'm losing my religion, I'm cruel to these feces pigeons
You may be immersed in this game, but you are missing the rules
Niggas act like savages, they go out looking for cabbage
I have nothing but love for my niggas who live luxuriously
Yes, we live them splendid, getting cabbage is a habit
Before it's over I'll have it all
Have a wide in a camisole with the cameras on
And they've been hating from the moment I blew
Let my enemies see me in a new blue Infiniti Q
Sippin 'Coke mixed with Hennessy too
Whoever is not a friend of mine in this industry will finally be finished
If you...
Shit the rest, two of the best on the west side
Niggas has been dying for years, so how could they blame us?
I never stop rescuing these damn G's
If you have it, better show off
Another order, two of the most wanted in the United States.
("It's nothing more than a gangsta ...")
West Coast, Tha Row mix, nigga
("It's nothing more than a gangsta party")
Nothing but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the world gangsta party
("It's nothing more than a gangsta party")
Nothing but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the world gangsta party
("It's nothing more than a gangsta party")
Nothing but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the world gangsta party
Now give me fifty feet
And keep what's left of me
Better get ready when you cowards fuck me
I burst and run, these niggas must be crazy, what?
No goddamn motherfuckers can't fade thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now it disappears
Lean in the presence of a chief player
Boss beach, boss beach, get the money and floss later
We drive away the haters, scratch them like a cross fader
I am Darth Vader, bound as a rapist.
The streets of southern Cal are wild like Al-Qaeda
Better watch it if you go in and hit
Travel in first class here, get out under the plane
Listen mayne, you better try to spread the love
New West, I'm the boss of
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I have a discard
Floating in the black Benz (biatch), trying to do one show a day
Niggas it's hard to kill on my block
Currency and mass schemes
Affiliated with scammers, so we did
My nigga (Dogg) with me, eternally the most wanted
("It's nothing more than a gangsta ...")
It's Tha Row with the world gangsta party
("It's nothing more than a gangsta ...")
("It's nothing more than a gangsta party")
Nothing but a gangsta party
It's Tha Row with the world gangsta party
Yes, D. Vegas, Crooked I, Makaveli
Without them weak ass niggas
Capital R, niggas, yeah
Paddle in peace
I loved you more than I loved me
I remember my last thought at night was about you
and my first thought in the morning was about you
It's been a long time since I actually
i sat and adored you but every once in a while
Your beautiful smile guides me through a day
I listen to you with another and you are waiting
I wish you good luck, he is lucky 2 power
You are in heaven?
Ahahha, all my boys can fight but we don't fall (ever)
Westside, westside
Second part of the war
Cross this nigga here, now Biggie tell me who do you fear?
My last enemy flashed and I smashed his ass
Bastard, fuck with me, I bet I blow your ass
Many follow me but cannot reach me, trapped in the maze
Catch them, imitating my style trying to speak this way
Impossible my gang falling, we riders of death row
There's no need to beg, motherfucker, there's no mercy within us
Feeling blessed, the richer I get, the more stressed I get
Dear God, I've been feeling like I'm close to Jesus
Paranoid with my guns closed, smoking trees
Watching niggas catch stray, shake, drown and bleed
I, a street mercenary, check my pedigree
Bustin's motherfuckers is the bully in me
Now niggas talk a lot about Bad Boy shit, then they scream
Bitch did catch feelings
Outlaw niggas, are you ready for clown?
My friends can fight but we don't fall
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Catching feelings
Outlaw niggas, are you ready for clown?
My friends can fight but we don't fall
Screamin 'bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Yes Napoleon!
Imagine me drinking at 1-5-1
Drunk than a motherfucker pulling my gun
Or high as a kite hitting hoes for fun
And that's not fair, dog, your heart pumps fear
In state I, I shoot you better hide black, the ramp is close
And you know as well as I do
You're not a murderer, so kill that, you wouldn't kill if you had to
We take the gospel of Makaveli, we pass it on
Holla "let's hit", let's test the power
Now we go together, we gather our thoughts
Because the hour will soon come
Gaddafi trained soldier, I'll show you how to use your weapon
Outlaw niggas, are you ready for clown?
My friends can fight but we don't fall
Screamin 'bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town

Catching feelings
We're screaming "M-A-D-E N-I-double G-As
From the sidewalk we work in the industry, you're kidding me
It really is nothing to me and my king, you see
We in big things eat an idiot, if you're hating
We will ride until the wheels fall off, pay attention
Screamin '"Goodbye bitches, untouchable sound"
Ride or die niggas, and we're hunting you
Representing all the real niggas caught in the trap
Banging with the po-po, trying to get a little bit more
Street life, young fighters running the clock
That's the world with feelings, this is a world of young men
Bitches in business, so learn something
Hey, stop running your mouth, you're about to scream
Bitch did catch feelings
Outlaw niggas, are you ready for clown?
My friends can fight but we don't fall
Screamin 'bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Catching feelings
Outlaw niggas, are you ready for clown?
My friends can fight but we don't fall
Screamin 'bye bye bitches, untouchable sound
Catching feelings
Everyone is a gangsta, but don't work
Instead of putting on armor, blacks put on skirts
These drugs don't help, they only make it worse
And the streets have nothing but a hearse
I only roll with the real
Outlaw niggas, are you ready for clown?
My friends can fight but we don't fall
Catching feelings
Outlaw niggas, are you ready for clown?
My friends can fight but we don't fall

Catching feelings
(Never hahaha yeah)
Did you read what Puffy and Big said on Vibe?
(The boys in my house can fight but we don't fall)
(Oh yeah)
Outlawz fled them
(The boys in my house can fight but we don't fall)
(Haha, west side, west side)
Oh this part two of the meat
Second part of the war
Cross this nigga here, now Biggie tell me who do you fear?
There is no living soul that breathes, it will not pump fear here
Bastard, fuck with me, I bet I blow your ass
Many follow me but cannot reach me, trapped in the maze
Catch them, imitating my style trying to speak this way
Impossible my gang falling, we riders of death row
There's no need to beg, motherfucker, there's no mercy within us
Feeling blessed, the richer I get, the more stressed I get
Smokin 'lye watching the time fly, waiting for death
Dear God, I've been feeling like I'm close to Jesus
Keep my eyes on my enemies, those close to me
Watching niggas catch stray, shake, drown and bleed
I, a mercenary on the streets, check my pedigree
Bustin's motherfuckers is the bully in me

Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Catching feelings
Shit, I'm a changed man
Big baller 2Pac in this bitch
At the age of sixteen I sold drug addicts
I'm not a drug dealer yet, but I saw them up close
I've got the feds wondering who broke the law
Too inhibited for gun smoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a damn diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon
Niggas stumbling homey, when are we leaving?
And I stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die from M.O.B
And fuck your nigga nigga, we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, the last to fall is a Balinese cat
He's death row, why the hell do you think we call him that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like us, house boys, there's no love in fast life
I change the gears of those jealous bitches, who are you afraid of?
I changed my plans but I'm still the same rider as always
Fucking a changed man
Slang a new drug to the world, but people still buy it
Nigga, you're fucking with a changed man
All my real niggas thugs, go and raise your hands
A changed man, you're dealing with a changed man
In drop top, the Glock cocked
Not if they got niggas, doughboys, and hot niggas
Who could shoot niggas but only for skrilla?
I am out of respect today they wait for me
Or anything you see in the past and can't catch
It's me, caliber in Escalate's backseat, don't slip
What do you think, T.I.P and they sweet? (Do not sleep)
It hits you from head to toe (And you don't know me)
You enter, you explode and you let recharge
You don't like a sturdy nigga, fuck you, hold me
Ain't no three niggas here to let me be
Or get inside there are codes for the streets nigga
I changed my plans but I'm still the same rider as always
Slang a new drug to the world, but people still buy it
Nigga, you're fucking with a changed man
Go and drink the Henn 'up
A changed man, you're dealing with a changed man
You're fucking with a changed man
A black so cold when I flow, I bow before death row
Three-wheeled movement, coming to shore
Screaming 'M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick boy
I fucked the world, the judge gave me probation
GIMME MINE, or am I exploding in every song
Assassinate my enemies, I'm crushing myself until I'm gone
And he fucks a bitch, 'cause a real sister loves blacks
Throw your hands in the air, close your eyes and wait
Never come against the mass of smoke, on death row
My adversaries bled
But fuck each other until the conversation stops
I changed my plans but I'm still the same rider as always
You're fucking with a changed man
Slang a new drug to the world, but people still buy it
Nigga, you're fucking with a changed man
All my real niggas thugs, go and raise your hands
Go and drink the Henn 'up
You're fucking with a changed man
A changed man, you're dealing with a changed man
I changed my plans but I'm still the same rider as always
You're fucking with a changed man
Slang a new drug to the world, but people still buy it
Nigga, you're fucking with a changed man
All my real niggas thugs, go and raise your hands
Go and drink the Henn 'up
You're fucking with a changed man
Shit, you don't know me
You don't know this 3-D nigga
Real lives right against you in front of your face
Shit..
Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
Nigga, you're fucking with a changed man
Hahaha, you're fucking with a changed man
Hahaha, I'm not the same, you're fucking with a changed man
We are not the same, you are fucking with a changed man
Changed man
Shit, I'm a changed man
Oh, turn off the lights
Me and big motherfucker syke
Big baller 2Pac in this bitch
You know how we balance this shit, look
(Niggas fucking with a changed man)
At the age of sixteen I sold drug addicts
I'm not a drug dealer yet, but I saw them up close
Until they noticed me, the feds wondered who had broken the law.
Too inhibited for gun smoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a damn diamond
And I stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die from M.O.B
And fuck your nigga nigga, we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, the last to fall is a cat
He's death row, why the hell do you think we call him that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like us, house boys, there's no love in fast life
I change the gears of those jealous bitches, who are you afraid of?
A changed man's game plan, so what I'm saying is
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (the damn wit changed the man)
But no one understands the ways of a changed man (nigga, damn changed man)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (the damn wit changed the man)
But no one understands the ways of a changed man (nigga, damn changed man)
Million dollar parcels
Birds and flocks is how I want to live
It's hard to change after living so negative
What I return is Mac and packages and facts
And an always lasting game takes care of your back and batteries
Young macks stay crazy and keep focus
Don't move to lean nigga soak this up, game
Of a criminal element remains open
Bud smoking trip nigga, get to smoke gat
Watch thieves, fake G's and perpetration
Put slugs on these wanna be thugs
In these drugs, outbreak and alcohol
After all, they gave us Pen's and our future children.
All the things that I did, where's my cigarette?
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (the damn wit changed the man)
But no one understands the ways of a changed man (nigga, damn changed man)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (the damn wit changed the man)
But no one understands the ways of a changed man (nigga, damn changed man)
Who's that nigga on the G-ride screaming?
CROWD.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick boy
In the face of imprisonment
Move the tapes like a heavy weight, slandering the entire nation
Assassinate my enemies, I'm crushing myself until I'm gone
And he fucks a bitch, 'cause a real sister loves blacks
Throw your hands in the air, close your eyes and wait
Never come against the mass of smoke, on death row
My adversaries bled
But fuck them all until the conversation stops, fuck a changed man
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (the damn wit changed the man)
But no one understands the ways of a changed man (nigga, damn changed man)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (the damn wit changed the man)
But no one understands the ways of a changed man (nigga, damn changed man)
Everyone thinks they understand me
Shit, you don't know me
You all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this 3-D nigga
Real lives right against you in front of your face
Shit, nigga, you're fucking with a changed man
This shit in Deathrow
Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
Hahaha..Nate Dogg on this bitch, you know nigga ain't no fucking joke
Do you know what time it is
Hahaha .. I'm not the same, you're fucking with a changed man
We are not the same, you are fucking with a changed man
Kurupt in this bitch
Bad dog azz and snoop
Aiite
I see no changes, I get up in the morning and wonder
Is it worth living? Should I exploit myself?
Cops don't give a damn
A less hungry mouth on wellness! "
First send them drugs and let them deal with brothers
Give them weapons, take a step back, watch them kill themselves
"It's time to defend yourself", that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey is dead
I have love for my brother
But we can never go anywhere unless we share with each other
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
How can the devil take a brother if he is near me?
I would love to go back to when we play as children
But things change ... and that's the way it is
That's the way it is
Things will never be the same
This is how it is, aww yeah
That's the way it is
Things will never be the same
This is how it is, aww yeah
I don't see changes, all I see are racist faces
Misplaced hatred dishonors the races
A better place, let's erase the waste
Eliminate evil from people, they will be acting well
‘Because both black and white are smoking crack tonight
And the only time we relax is when we kill ourselves
It takes skill to be real, time to heal
And although it seems heaven sent
We are not ready to see a black president
It's not a secret, don't hide the fact
The penitentiary is full and full of blacks.
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but you stay in the drug game
Now tell me, what should a mother do?
You have to operate the easy way
"I did a G today", but you did it in a bad way
Selling crack to children
"They pay me!" - well, but that's the way it is
Things will never be the same
This is how it is, aww yeah
Things will never be the same
This is how it is, aww yeah
We have to make a change
Let's change the way we eat
And let's change the way we treat ourselves
You see the old way didn't work
So it's up to us to do what we have to do to survive
And I still don't see any changes; Can't a brother have a little peace?
It is a war on the streets and a war in the Middle East.
Instead of war on poverty
They have a drug war so the police can bother me
And I've never committed a crime that I don't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, I'll give it back
Don't let them lift you up, back you up
Break and squeak
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the police they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to hurry, I break this
You say it's not right, my mom didn't raise a fool
And as long as I stay black, I have to stay tied
And I can never lie down
‘Because I always have to worry about recovery
Some money I mistreated a long time ago
Coming back after all these years
"Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat", that's how it is
That's the way it is
Things will never be the same
This is how it is, aww yeah
(You are my brother, you are my sister)
That's the way it is
Things will never be the same
("I do not know.")
Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Oh shit, we gotta get out of here
("Hell yeah.")
Nigga, it's time to leave nigga
Hey call Kurupt, call Daz's room
("Hi, bitch, where's Suge, nigga?")
Call Suge, call all the niggas and tell them to meet me down below
("Where's K and those niggas in the man?")
Tell the valet, bring the Benz
("Oh, have you seen my shoes?")
Hi Kurupt, you all niggas are driving or flying back, what's up?
("Man, I'm a rolling man, fuck that shit")
Hi Syke nigga, come on man, get out of the bathroom fool
("Fuck that, I lost some money, nigga")
Aw nigga damn
Now I wake up early in the morning, my breath stinks while I'm yawning
I concentrated on some roles while I liked sexy capers
Will these rap lyrics bring us more space in Las Vegas?
I'm a beach boss, death before I let these bitches break us
A hoochie and her dirty friend dancing with me and my man
I said I was interested, imagine all the shit we did
I made her hot and horny, all about me, what a weird bitch
First you argue, then I fight, until you lick me where I like it
I got an excited nigga, never mind, just don't bite it
I could never see the scene
Too busy trying to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems like it's time to check out
We have to go, we have to go!
We have to go, we have to go!
We have to go, we have to go!
Yeah baby hahaha, time to check it out!
I have to go black, I have to go
("You know what time it is!")
Oh come on man, take all the bags, man, call the motherfucker valet
Tell him to get some black shit, cause we got this out, motherfucker
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panties raid
But it did it all, it ended too soon
All the friends running down the hallways room by room
So it's only fair for me to disappear into the night
My game is very difficult
Then I find time to rest
Sneak into your room, instant Messiah, shitty wines of all kinds
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night
I have to warm you up and warm you up
Play as Micheal Jackson and hit him
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
Because there is someone else who deserves my attention
Then all the friends gather in the hall
Because bustin 'bitches is a hobby, nigga
