('Cause you can't knock the hustle...)
Ohh, uuuuuuahyeah, uuuuuuooooooh
Foooooool's, paradise
(Jay-Z, ha ha, Meli'sa Morgan)
You better think twice
(Roc-A-Fella y'all, it don't stop)
'Cause it's not very nice
We about to change this game dear
Check my pockets, ain't nothing but game there
I remain without peer, keep the lames clear
And the cats that's all about scratch remain here
On top of this Metropolis
My name's like a swear
Dropped off every tier
Now y'all can swear to Jay
Heard it the other day
Through the missive, peep how they script it
We got to hear you every night 'fore we hit the lights, it's type addictive
Need cash to live with, the beat goes on
Every day is a hustle, the heat grows on
Funny thing happens when years of chasing money unfolds
And the only thing worse than getting old is not getting old
Niggas stay low, like six-fours of shit and gold
And watch for hoes with form fitting clothes
And I, hope you shine
Seen many wrinkles and enough memories to last you two lifetimes
Can't knock the hustle
I'm taking out this time (uh huh, uh huh)
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle, how we do)
Who do you think you are?
Maybe one day you'll be a star
Check this
In a man's world need a girl to touch something
Pull an 80 out her Anne Klein purse and bust something
If you skating through the night to the light, then trust something
When I get home, then it's on
Girl just crack your shaped legs like Grade A eggs
Love the way you behave and beg
Moans, turns to hollers and screams as we zone like a college team
Then they can hear you from Hollis, Queens
Life with me, consists of a lot of things
Chicks in your ear, kicking dirt, 'cause you got hotter rings
But you know how to scream, friends talking dizziness
Remind them freak chicks, stay out my bizziness
Know they can't love it, trips to L.A. with no luggage
Came back with six bags struggling
In first class if my ass should crash, champagne spilled on me
Steak still warm on me
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy (uh huh)
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel (how we, how we do)
The way you're making me feel ('cause you can't knock the hustle)
I don't want no romance, I just want the chance
Can't knock the hustle for real (ha)
Ever since I retired, working alongside of live wires
To this rap biz with fake nigs you know liars
I guess I'm biased 'cause what I talk about I live
These rap dudes conflicted
Some of them ain't even rapping for chips
What part of the game is this?
Seems brainless, on tours like whores, guess what I'm saying I miss
Cats that go all out for their gold plaques
Started with four jacks, ended up with gold Ac's
Bet your lungs collapse if my funds get trapped
On their, way to me through you, screw you
Gun blew you, out of one then two shoes
Run through you like um, excuse you
But that's my cash, gotta understand your hustle
But that's my cash, you don't understand
Let my dough pass, you can show it love
Like a rap star in front of the club
But don't knock the hustle
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Maybe one day you'll be a star (Jigga, Meli'sa)
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
But until then baby, I'm the one who's crazy (uh huh, ha ha)
'Cause that's the way you making me feel
The way you making me feel
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
I don't want no romance (how we do), I just want the chance (say what)
Can't knock the hustle for real
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Remix (the hustle), '96
(Can't knock the hustle)
Don't stop, 'til the top
Roc-A-Fella y'all
('Cause I can't knock the hustle, the hustle)
Irv Gotti, Jigga (can't knock the hustle)
Meli'sa Morgan, uh huh
'Cause you can't knock the hustle
(The hustle, can't knock the hustle
'Cause I can't knock the hustle, the hustle
'Cause I can't knock the hustle)
'Cause you can't knock the hustle...
