Blood on my hands and it look like candy
How I pay-pay lawyers, and nobody can't stand me
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I got blood on my hands and it look like candy
How I pay-pay lawyers, and nobody can't stand me
Yeah-yeah (Turn me up)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

This what kings do, talk paper and skate
You know what this what kings do, lay up and stack in the gate
This what kings do, throw family first it's real
This what kings do, think about flyin' a Persian, yup
This what kings do, vacate lands in Egypt
This what kings do, breakdown plans with speeches

This what kings do, hit Dubai in a night
And this how kings move, yo, hold your money and invest wise
Whether you sellin' buttons, or select pies
A king move, keep it silent, no one else dies
We all Pharaohs and Cameros, flexin' S5s
It's what a king do
This how a king move
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
How I pay-pay lawyers, and nobody can't stand me
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
I got blood on my hands and it look like candy
How I pay-pay lawyers, and nobody can't stand me
Yeah-yeah (Turn me up)
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
