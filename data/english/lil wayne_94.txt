Thats what they saying when the play me and they hear me on the radio
Thats what they saying to me x3

Thats what they be yelling

And since day one ive looked forward to 3, 4, 5 bitches in my porsche coupe

Thats what they saying when the play me and they hear me on the radio
Thats what they saying to me
Thats what they saying to me
Thats what they telling me
When the remy's in the system
Ain't no question ima fuck em and diss em
