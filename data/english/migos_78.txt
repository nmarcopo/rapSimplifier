Quavo:
Feelin like John ghotti , bricks in da rari
All my niggas killas, bringing pistols in da party
I'm kickin it with the vato ,  trapping and wrapping the kilo
Kickin it with the migo, countin up the pesos
Sippin on lean I'm losing my mind , The Lord is giving me plenty of signs
Since a young nigga I'm watching my brother
I'm walkin around and now I got the nine
I don't love the pussy , you niggas is rookie , I'm smokin on cookie my pockets on snookie
Pull up in jags and rovers its over I'm ballin like Lamar odom
Takeoff:
Real trap niggas get money ,pick up the phone whenever it's money
Sellin dem bricks they dummy
Wrapping that work like a mummy
The birds, you know that they humming , them hollow tips bust and u runnin
Sellin that coco nocolo , the plug it b costa Nostra
2'Brown:
We the ones dodgin the FBI , we the ones drop in the 4
Mix it with water then heat it up , whip it around with the fork
Mix it around wit the coke , meet me up rite at the store
Top of the line , creme of the crop, hit it and murda she wrote
Got that pistol tucked in my Gucci belt , work with the water like micheal phelps
Give me the doe need nothing else , fuck signin deals ill sign myself
I'm real mob tied , real boss hog , really let u have it , shit ill num your jaw
I got my migos comin cross the border, grocery bag full of arm and hammer baking soda
Me n my migos get that work in , have your whole block sowed for you count to 10
Wats up quavo. Wats up takeoff. Wats up offset . Man dis for the projects
Dis for the gangsta s, dis for the hustlas , the costa Nostra dawg they can't touch us
They can't see me , they can't b me , the Feds watch me dawg like ima tv
Cd stay on repeat, creep through with that street sweep , stay round where da gs be
Kilo go for 33
