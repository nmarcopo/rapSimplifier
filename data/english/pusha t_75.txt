Yeah, look
Look
Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?"
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' "Makaveli"
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin so we bail-ready
Still find a brick in my Tupperware
Two can get you four like a double-dare
Buried in the snow, bring a shovel here
Hidin' is the only struggle here, Push
Ever since I ran into a deficit
Had it sent, [?]
I just wanna-wanna, I was goin' George Jetson
Niggas still treatin' me like George Jefferson
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I buy you a sick truck
I buy you some new tits, I get you that nip-tuck
I start a new family, the condom done slipped up
Just keep your lips shut, the zip, the zip stuck
The summer-
(I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck, I like)
I love that flow
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I buy you a sick truck
I buy you some new tits, I get you that nip suck
We start another family, the condom done slipped up
Just get your lips up, just zip your lips shut, bitch
Zip shut, this, this shut
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I buy you a sick truck
I buy you some new tits, just keep your lips, mhm, mhm
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I buy you a sick truck
I buy you some new tits, just keep the (Aw fuck, aw fuck)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I buy you a sick truck
I buy you some new tits, I buy you that nip-tuck
Started a new family, the condom done slipped up
Just keep your lips shut, bitch, zipped shut
*gibberish*
