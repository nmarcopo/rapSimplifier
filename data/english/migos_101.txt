Pull up on a nigga with the chopper, think he seen the Ghostbusters
I got the diamond detector so niggas can't say that my diamonds fugazi
VS1s in my Cuban necklace, in the VIP section drinking Texas
Bitch I got Africa sittin' on my pinky
Trafficking seagulls, they calling me Beanie
Breitling Bentley made by Bentley Motors
Bentley Mulsanne I leased it , it's not rented
Red dot for your head, Green Dot for my niggas in the penitentiary
Looking real hard, don't know what they saw
This a Audemar Piguet
Fuck it, I’m thinking about throwing baguettes in my chandelier ceiling
And I'mma scrape the game for every crumb cause a nigga came from a fuckin penny

Thirty thousand for a Rollie
To you, I spent a lot of guacamole
Take a look in my jewelry box, it's open
I got the cash, they say you got tokens
Where the receipt at?
Tell your watch is stolen
Now everybody say they got a Rollie
Remember one year ago rocking Mike Kors
Now when I shop different bags in the stores
Cash out on a Audemar shining just like the stars
My jewelry box came with some burglary bars
My diamond dancing singing El Dabarge
I treated my diamonds like beauty bars
My diamonds different colors, living colors
They be jumping around like a rock star
No Jackson 5 but it's 3 of us brothers
We keep the Nina now we pop stars
While you sitting there watch me on instagram
You can count the rings on my fucking hand
Only eight fingers a hundred bands
Seventy racks for my Migo man
Thirty K for Quavo Rolex
She want it so bad that's a price check
Came from trapping and now I do mic check
I will take your life dare you to touch my neck
Hold it out (Hold it out)
Let them see it
Don't be scared
Hold it out (Hold it out)
Let them see it
Don't be scared
Whether it's a Rollie or AP or Breitling
Let them see it
Don't be scared
Whether it's a Rollie or AP or Breitling

My watch is authentic you niggas' watches they be rented
You need to throw it in a blender
When I seen a nigga watch, I got offended
WatchBusta the judge and you got convicted
You and your partners is codefendants
Evidence telling your watch is fiction
You went to the Jeweler he bust your medulla
For something that wasn't even official
FakeWatchBusta can't bust me
I am no busta my diamonds yellow look like mustard
You need some WD-40, your diamonds is rusty
I come through these bitches look like bustas
You rappers be lying, You talking bout VVS
When your pockets looking like you anorexic
My diamonds, my diamonds been tested
I might go to Africa — diamond selection
I'm getting my big diamonds straight out the Tiffany
My time is telling the bodily energy
Official tissue from the Rolex company
Fake watch that's not rich to me
It's not official you're not tricking me
Thirty K nigga ain't shit to me
If you think my watch fake you can get a key
I got the golden ticket Chuck E. Cheese
Hold it out (Hold it out)
Let them see it
Don't be scared
Hold it out (Hold it out)
Let them see it
Don't be scared
Whether it's a Rollie or AP or Breitling
