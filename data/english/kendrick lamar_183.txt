All of the studios
Cut off the lights
Persuasive invasion, that could cost our life
Head in the clouds but my vision alright
Looking though fog, yeah my head at the night
Audio cardio, I jog your brain
Just like I'm Kanye, they think I’m insane
Look up to God and he calling my name
How can I handle the faith and the fame
