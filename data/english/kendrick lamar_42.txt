All those days in, all that stays in
I don't keep it, I won't be here for it
All those days in, all that stays in
I don't keep it though, I won't be here for it
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic can't stand me
Ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
I got lood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic can't stand me
Ya-yah, turn me up, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
Ya-yah, ya-yah
This what kings do, talk paper and skate
You know what this what kings do, lay up and stack in the gate
This what kings do, throw family first, it's real
This what kings do, thinkin' about flying the [?] up
This what kings do, vacay lands in Egypt
This what kings do, rake down plans with speeches
This what kings do, make sure mama is right, yup
This what kings do, hit Dubai in a night
And this how kings move, yo, hoe your money and invest wise
Whether you selling buttons or select pies
A king move, keep it silent, no one else dies
We all pharaohs in Camaros flexin' S5's (Uhuh)
It's what kings do, this how a king move (What up, son?)
Yo, yo, yo, yo, ayo
Blood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic can't stand me
Ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
I got lood on my hands and it look like candy
I pay-ay lawyers and the mic can't stand me
Ya-yah, turn me up, ya-yah, ya-yah, ya-yah
Ya-yah, ya-yah
