Old school, new school need to know this I burn like
Left Eye Lisa Lopez, burn slow like blunts of hydro
Jigga Man, BK shit, y'all know
Jigga Man, ya heard, the fugitive allow me to spit on this Clue shit
Allow me to thank the people for all of their support and your prayers
And all the people that prejudge me, fuck you, suck my dick
D.A. act like a nigga starvin' for Jay if they lock me in a cage
Fuck it, party away I'm still hot, I'm still S dot y'all
Still got Millions buried in the sock drawer
Still holdin' my own on the corner nigga
What can't kill me can only make me stronger nigga
And when I get back home get your ass up out the throne
It's just goin' back to the way shit was
I'ma stay hot no matter what my shit does
I could drop a straight dud, I'ma stay up niggas tryin' to break my will
You know that ain't my steel I'm Destiny's Child, my fate's been sealed
You're dealin' with a higher power I'm like Dwight Eisenhower
My life can move a thousand miles and hour reflect me folks
As my world turns like the wheels on a bicycle spoke
It's much deeper than a soap, it's a constant drama series
All they see is money, they want me to blind the jury
All this bullshit can make the mind weary but my theory
Is the sun shines clearly
(The sun will shine clearly)
Now everybody wanna rhyme like Hov' 'cause I rhyme
Like I be rhymin' in the Rov' climbin' in them hoes
My minds like the diamonds, I'll blind you at them shows
I don't shine, I glow, I remind you of that dough don't I?
Murder niggas won't I?
My persona, hustler turned rapper, smell the crack aroma
Send shots like toma in any language
Leave niggas in a coma when I'm bangin' that Fifth
Get chicks lit off Coronas and bamboo spliffs
And get the camcorder to cam cord their hand movements
And for what? Y'all actin' like y'all better than Hov'
Y'all niggas should open up for the Letterman show
Niggas is funny, all I do is get money
And y'all niggas sound funny to me everybody's rappin'
Like they better than Hov' but thats shits real funny to me
I'm at the forefront of this rap shit, truth is truth
Look around at all the platinum, proof is proof
Listen to how niggas is rappin', thats do to who?
But I'ma let niggas live 'cause it's beautiful
Live niggas
Jigga Man ya heard? Clue Duro
