Yeah, this that treacherous nights, Killadelphia type shit
Hold your Thirty tight, when you go to sleep
All we know is gun violence (Gun violence)
Go to jail, come back and now your son wildin' (He wildin')
Got a price all on his head, don't give a fuck 'bout it (He don't give a fuck)
Sittin' on the couch with his grandmamas, smelling like gun powder (Fuck that shit)
Yee, Yee, all we know is gun violence (That's all we know)
He just smoked a nigga broad day, ain't give a fuck 'bout it (Hrr)
Now it's murder gone to his head, he gettin' a rush 'bout it (He get a rush)
