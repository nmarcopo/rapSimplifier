Havin' mob ties
Came a long way from Perry Ellis
First time I seen a drug dealer
Meet the plug was on the movie Belly (woop)
Huncho season no lettuce (lettuce)
We only fuck her if she let us
She pop a school bus, Bettis
She eat my hot dog with no relish (oh)
We don't do flex or wrestlin' (naw)
Quarter mill' down on my mansion (yup)
Magnum up under my mattress
Choney he gonna attack it (Choney)
Remember them niggas was laughin'
Remember them niggas was havin'
Remember them niggas was askin' (now)
Damn them niggas still askin' (aye)
We in the game, you in the bleachers
Now it's 30k for a feature (thirty)
I thought you said you didn't see me
Now you wanna treat me like we been eatin' (oh)
Celiné bag was her dream bag
She thick as fuck
I've never seen that
Oh I’ve never seen that
I've never seen that
No no, I know you ain't never seen that
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
All eyes on me
