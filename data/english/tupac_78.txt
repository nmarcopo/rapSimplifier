Bury me  a g, bury me  a g, thug life know the time it is, feel me
Thinkin' back, reminiscin' on my teens
A young G, gettin' paid over dope fiends
Fuckin' off cash that I made
Nigga, what's the sense of workin' hard, if you never get to play
I'm hustlin', stayin' out 'til it's dawn
And comin' home at 6 o'Clock in the mornin'
Hand's on my Glock, eyes on the prize
Finger on the trigger when a nigga ride
And I be Shootin' craps, bustin' niggas out the door
Pick my money off the floor, God bless the tre-four
Stuck on full, drunk again
Spill a little liquor for the homies in the pen'
Say them thug life niggas be like major pimps
Stickin' to the rules wasn't made to simp
Keep my finger on my Mac mane
The crack game ain't shit
Niggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
(and I) I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
And I'll be stayin' strapped
My Mac-11 make my nuts bigger
I keep my finger on the trigger for you jealous niggas
Wonder why a motherfuckers nutty, and why I'm up worried
When I see a cemetery full of dead buddies
Mama told me "son, don't lie"
And Mama's in the back smokin' crack and a nigga wanna die
Can't cry cause I'm loc'd up
Choked up, nigga puffing on that indo getting fucked up
And in the back of my mind, I know I'm wrong
Alcohol make a young motherfucker think he ballin'
Collect calls to my old bitches, send more pictures
On the phone, tryin' to bone cause I miss ya
Back on the streets I'm losin' focus
I'm hopeless, homies dyin' over small time dope shit
Keep my finger on my Mac man
The crack game ain't shit
Niggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
So you wanna make a million?
And motherfuckers catchin' drug cases
I place my Glock outside my waist and keep a thug face
Even on a good day!, gotta stay strapped
Livin' in my hood, hey!
Niggas will spray caps
And everybody wanna go to heaven, don't nobody wanna pray
So I stay clutchin' on my AK
Murderin' niggas that oppose me
That's how it goes, you motherfuckers try to play me and the homies
Time to make my get-away
I hid away in the backstreets
Couldn't let the police jack me
Gotta be quiet, I'm on the down low
I got that ya-yo movin' by the pound so
When the police try me out, fuck the judge
Got a homie that'll bond me out, straight love
Keep my finger on my Mac man
The crack game ain't shit
Niggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
Stuck on fool, Tanqueray got a nigga high
Lord knows I don't need another DUI
I lead a Thug Life, heartless hustler
Just cause I fucked, don't mean I trust her
Now my pagers vibratin', can't sleep
So I'm mobbin' to the ho's house, bumpin' Isley
"Is it cool to fuck?" That's what I'm askin'
Bitch recognized game and started laughin'
Now I'm all in the guts and shit
Prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
Cause I'll fuck and get up, I'll let you know
I'll be a 10 minute brother for a $2 ho
Lots of hoes gettin' mad as shit
I let a trick be a trick, you can have that bitch
Keep my finger on my Mac man
The crack game ain't shit
Niggas trippin' in this rap game, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
(cause) I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
(cause)I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my motherfuckin' riches
Even when I die, they won't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
(cause)I ain't got time for bitches
