Number 34
Migo! QC!
Barkley, Barkley (Wow!)
Yo, yo
Feds hit the spot they ain't find no work cause the bricks right under me
"Fheww!" Sell a brick so fast : Float like a butterfly, sting like Ali
Charles Barkley, 34oz got the broccoli
Charles Barkley, 34oz got the broccoli
Yo, Quavo
I got the broccoli
Trappin' and cappin' the top of the double tree
You better make way in the industry
Young nigga, I come to bless the economy
Remember my teachers, they say I wouldn't make it
I wonder if they ever think of me ... (Bow! Bow!)
I don't give a fuck feeling like Pac on my enemies
Your bitch she say that she loving a boss I tell her get lost (Adios)
We flex in 'sace, Versace, Givenchy, don't care what they cost (Givenchy?)
My niggas still trapping out bandos they come from the north
Now a nigga want to take a picture
Wanna flex with a nigga cause I'm worth 6 figures
You niggas done heard of me
Came from the poverty, family unity, Georgia community
Fucked up situation, underestimated
Now we in Bentley's and Rovers in Beverley
Look in the mirror, young rich nigga
Raised by my mama and my grandma nigga
No father figure, I'm a street nigga
Call me the god-father fuck nigga
I knew what it took to be bossed up, had a whole lot to offer
Sacrifice, I took some losses
Snakes in the grass be cautious
Rich forever, never going broke
I don't give a fuck if I got to go to selling dope
I got the bags, grocery store
Selling them O's, flipping them bowls
Remember when I was a kid, mama told me eat my broccoli
(Eat that damn broccoli !)
Remember me I'm at the bus stop flexing my brand new pair of Barkley's
Different day, different year, different swag
I gave up the Barkley's for you wannabes
Cause you fuck niggas are under me
High-top or Low top, Giuseppe me
Charles Barkley, 34, I got the currency
Flowing like poetry
Cook it like poultry
Migos QC with the new OKC
My trap full of kids like an elementary
Selling that Hannah Montana and Kimberly
I trap but I keep it a mystery
Cause if they knew the Police'll be after me
