Conjunction junction, what's my function?
I'm workin' up tracks to tap niggas that function
It's not 2Pac or that nigga Dr. Dre
It's the motherfucking gangsta from around the way (Hey)
The one that brings you styles on timesy-wimesy
That's why so hard to find me
Conduction, construction when I bust
Choo-choo, bustas, it's a must, let me bust, let me bust
Because I got to bust off of the top of the H-E-A-D
It's a must with my nigga Richie Rich and 2Pac
It's Warren G, yo, I got a cliggy-clock
Ends with my nigga SN double O P
D O double G, Y D O double to the G
Let me come back 'cause I'm like this, see
The LB to the motherfuckin' gangsta C
Niggas don't hear me though, baby
It's Warren G endo I'm kinda crazy
Don't trip off me, bro
Let me just kick a motherfucka 'cause I flow for my homie
Well, I can take one two and let you know that it be hype
Standin' up finna shoot the shot to young Syke
What you wanna do is throw your flow to let 'em know
When it's comin' R-F-E double E, though (Woo)
One time for the camera, Richard's come to slam ya
Pickin' out your hat, yeah, Georgetown's phat
With the bulldog, ooh wee, why's he wanna do me?
Rich could give a fuck about a tramp and a hoochie
I hang with niggas from the block like 2Pac
What you wanna do is try to keep him locked
'Cause uhh if a nigga he tries to play ya
Although he's telling your kid like he's a playa but
Don't bang, hang don't it
What you wanna do is get away from in front of me
And I'll be pickin' up the slack
It's thug 2Pacalypse now to grab the gat and rip the track
'Cause it's all aboutâ€” makin' money
Ain't a damn thing funny, work me up, sonny
I be like calm in my business, time to hit that shit
I'm rippin' up the track 'cause I be down with the clique
And all my niggas in the house we hella drunk
We went and got some Tanqueray, nigga, we ain't no punks
It's time to get our drink on, nigga
And smoke lots of dank and uh
What we do, we takin' money to the bank
'Cause this is all in the paper's
Bitches be catchin' vapors and uhh
Clinton couldn't fuckin' save us
And it's all in 'cause niggas be ballin'
I drive a fuckin' Benz 'cause I'm all in
And don't be havin' friends
Just niggas like to talk a lot, that's what we see
That's why we made this fuckin' jam animosity
I won't quit, I talk a lot of shit
But buck it all up, 'cause I'll be ready to throw 'em up
But niggas don't wanna slang 'em 'cause I bring 'em
I be, 165 but I'm high 'til I fuckin' die
So you what you wanna do? Bring your whole fuckin' crew
And my Glock'll have them niggas runnin' up the block
My nigga Syke, he do what the fuck he like
And he's next on the mic, so won't you hit these niggas hella high
Never again will I ever trust a bitch
You can get that ass if they think you rich
Hungry bitches I can spot 'em a mile away
They get nice when it's close to they birthday
All of you do is hang around and stay down
And don't try to front, you fuckin' clown
'Cause your woman is fine but she ain't yours
'Cause she creepin' through my motherfuckin' back door
It feels good the way I make her moan
'Cause she don't get served like this at home
If I keep her too late, she might get in trouble
You think highly but I got to bust your bubble
'Cause a mack's gotta do what a mack's gotta do
She bragged to her friends, so I fucked her crew
'Cause I'm single when a gangsta got to mingle
And while I was stabbin' it, ooh, it tingle
I'ma leave 'em, I'ma leave 'em, yeah I can see
But when you do, you won't be with me
Like being with me, that's my change
But you cookie hungry hoes would stay saved
So let a bitch be a bitch, and a ho be a ho
'Cause if you blaze and roll, you will never know
So never again, never again
So don't get a woman, just have friends
So fuck a motherfuckin' bitch
