Money long, clip long
Dick long, bitch gone
Bricks gone, Knicks gone
Trappin' off a flip phone (Flip)
My uncle old as hell, he want me to whip it 'cause his wrist gone (Skrrt)
Bitch, you broke as hell, your car look like it came of Flinstone (Ha ha ha)
Diamonds check, Saint Laurent check, bitch, I got a check (21)
Avianni check, Gucci check, everything a check (On God)
Ridin' in a 'Rari, Nudy in the cab, Chevy and a 'Vette
Don't you disrespect, Buck .50, slit his neck (21)
I got all my ice on, ice on
I got all my ice on (Yeah), ice on (Yeah)
I got all my ice on (Yeah), ice on (Yeah)

Bitch, you see me shinin' like a lightbulb (21, 21)
Frostbite, bitch, you know my ice cold (Brr)
Nigga, tuck your chain, and your ice old (21, 21)
Wrong move, nigga, get your brains blowed
She a bugaboo, I had to change form (Change form)
Ridin' with my niggas, and the brains blow (Brains blow)
Quiet Storm came on, I had to change songs (Cut it out)
I ain't take her panties off, she had to change thongs (Take it off)
They heard Young Savage, they had to change flows (Tried to copy)
You can't clone me, you better change goals (Nigga, stop)
And take that off your neck, nigga, that ain't gold (Fuck)
You been rapping' all your life and you can't get on ('Sup?)
Goyard bag, full of cash, yeah (Racks, racks)
Louis bag full of Mary Kate and Ash (Bricks, racks)
I met her in the club, she was shakin' ass (21, 21)
Broke my thumb countin' money, I think I need a cast (21, 21)
I got all my ice on, ice on (Wow, wow)
I got all my ice on, ice on (Wow, wow)
I got all my ice on, ice on

Bitch, you see me shinin' like a lightbulb (Bling)
Frostbite, bitch, you know my ice cold (21, 21)
Nigga, tuck your chain, and your ice old (21)
Wrong move, nigga, get your brains blowed (On God)
