Ear drummers
Yeah, my success is their nightmares
Wide awake but the boogeyman is right here
Paid dues, I done earned every stripe here
Paid you just to get it on them flights, yeah
We are not peers, we are not equal
I am not the sequel to any of you people
We don't even share the same prequel
I am drug dealer, you a pill popper, credit card nigga
I am shotta
You niggas is opera, I am more blocks
All I wanna hear is choppa, choppa
Authenticity holds more weight than an Oscar
Emmy, really holds the semi, really sold Demi
More than these rappers with their ghost stories
One of the few that can really boast, post-glory
It's a war outside no man is safe from
Where they pray I fall from grace from
Push
I came to G.O.O.D. Music with the checkered past
Some said I was finished, checkered flag
But like the LVs on this on this checkered bag
A nigga still play chess on your checkers ass
Yet Sean be youthful, tell Ye "Stay neutral"
While the president makes the company fruitful
I just wanna make my own dark, twisted, beautiful
Gotta factor in the powder under my cuticles
Still, if you lookin' for real, we don't stop at the yield
See, 'cause balling's a sport, take a look at my real
One horse on the grill, the other one on the shield
That's the 'Rari and Porsche, a quarter short of a mil'
See my name on the bill, naked bitch in the pill
Cop some L on the flight, let us smoke it with ills
The art of the hustle, still an ultimate thrill
The tenure of blowbama's a license to kill, yeah
