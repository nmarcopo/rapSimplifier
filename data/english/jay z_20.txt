My first brick did it
I knew I was addicted when I flipped it to four
Then I whipped it to more
And it's like the streets call you:
"How could you leave me after all I done for you?
Who else would employ you? I made you feel royal
All it took was some oil, some water
Some baking soda to make you Hova"
My first taste of power, I'm numb off the feeling
I'm done off, niggas, I can't stop dealing
I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot
Ain't you afraid to go to jail? God
Well use your brain, are you sane?
But like Dale Earnhardt, the game is racing through my veins
And I crash every time, but like I never hit the wall
I need the K's like Pedro so I'm back pitching raw
And when the bases are loaded and cops try to squeeze play
The game ain't cold enough to ever freeze Jay
And I, need the green like fiends need yay'
And they, say it ain't right but it's the game of life
I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot
I rap now, I eat good
I smoke good, drink good
Multi-millionaire but still I think hood
Belly full, I can't shake it
The hunger in my belly has been replaced with other forms of starvation
I guess it's just the need to be heard
I need niggas to say, "I can't believe ya words"
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Thoughts is sporadic, I gotta unconfuse it
Sort of like a Rubik's Cube is
Every album's a color, but I fuck up the other, color
Ha, I guess I'm more like
A bitch with a belly but her ass is right, haha
Y'all don't understand me still
I'll never enjoy my success but my family will
And I'm alright with that
So the rap Jerry Rice is back
To fulfill the need, though I lead the league
I pray everyday, I travel at God's Speed
Not a minute slower 'cause the minute you Hova
Everybody's praying for your spinach to slow up
It's sad but it's true, but niggas ass gon' turn blue
Holding your breath 'cause the force that's controlling my step
Won't let me lose it, 'til I'm undisputed
Until I'm one with the music
'Til I'm dead and gone, in search of the perfect song, mon mon
I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot
