Let's try this, Guru
(Every time I think about you) yeah yeah
(I feel so alive)
(I wish I could hold onto you forever)
This is how I start my day anew
Uhh, uh huh, uh huh, yeah, uhh
(I woke up early this morning with a new sight over life)
Good morning America, ghetto USA
(Never read the Qur'an or Islamic scriptures
Only Psalms I read was on the arms of my niggas)
Uhh, come on, good morning
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
(The sunshine was shining, you were on my mind)
Yeah, I wake up, hit my shoebox, I snatch out a few rocks
Put the rest inside, now I'm ready to ride
Put the bomb in my socks so cops can't locate the vials
I ain't freshly dressed but got a Colgate smile
That's right, hah
(I woke up early this morning)
Throw on the same clothes I had on last night
I got loads of capers to come up with this paper
I got money schemes that come to me in my dreams
Hit the block like a veteran
Fiends need they medicine, I'm the relief pitcher
Their clean up hitters, it works
I hit the Ave., stash the bag in the dirt
Put the rest in my small pocket, I start clockin'
(I woke up early this morning)
Same routine: I'm runnin' game to fiends
Exchangin' cash for crack rocks, back and forth to my stash box
Hundred dollars a week
Shorties got the Ave. watched, fiends swarm
I'm gettin' rid of this bomb, as I
(I woke up early this morning with a new sight over life)
Good morning
(Never read the Qur'an or Islamic scriptures
Only Psalms I read was on the arms of my niggas)
(I woke up early this morning with a new sight over life)
(The sun was shinin', you were on my mind)
(I woke up early this morning...)
