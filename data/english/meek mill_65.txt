It's so hard for me to sit back here, in this studio
Looking at a guy out here, hollering my name
When last year I spent more money on spilt liquor
In bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made
You're talking to the Rolex wearing
Diamond ring wearing, kiss stealing, woo!
Wheeling dealing, limousine riding, jet flying son of a gun
And I'ma have a hard time, holding these alligators back
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Anybody wanna act loco?
Who you with? Numerous shots from the .44
Young nigga in the low low
Jumpin' out the thing with a little bad bitch like YOLO
.44 on my hip line, this time ain't no joke
In the hood where there ain't no hope
Now everybody ridin' dirty like it ain't no soap
Everybody get to rappin' when there ain't no coke
Where the money nigga? Cop 44 a bird where I live at
Probably buy the whole load if you get it back
Fishscale when it's stamped in the rental wrapped
Little nigga you ain't stuntin', give that rental back, oh
I like fast cars, fast broads and my last car was like a NASCAR
It go vroom, vroom, then skrr, skrr 'fore I blast off
She go up and down like NASA, bike life on your bitch nigga
Pop a wheelie all in that pussy, she switchin' gears on this dick nigga
Still young, reckless, and rich nigga, yellow diamonds like piss nigga
Stones they glistening nigga, ya'll suckas don't do it like this nigga
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
That nigga right there, that nigga right there
Look at that nigga right there
That bitch right there, that bitch right there
Look at that bitch right there
You ain't bout that life, you ain't bout that
That price tag you ain't bout that
That bitch you lovin' we popped that
That shit talk you ain't bout that
Don't get caught in that traffic
Niggas ain't bout that action
You can keep your chain
My niggas don't want that plastic
Niggas talkin' bout they got mils
Niggas talkin' bout they got wheels
Niggas talkin bout they got skill
He alright, he not real
Got a little flow, that's cool with me
Got a little dough, that's cool with me
Got a little watch, a little jewelry
Them Self Made niggas, Volume 3
That work get through like woo!
Shorty got that Ric Flair pussy like woo
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
You say y'all with it, but don't handle your business
When the car pull up
Y'all niggas slippin', with the window rolled up
That choppa with to whippin'
Choppa went to whippin', ain't no God, ain't no priest
Just your body, floating in blood, exposed to the street
I'm bout that life, I don't play no game, that snitch shit lame
In the booth, you know I'm flame, Ross put me in the game
MGB, come and get that bang, that molly gang
MMG, cut that check, plus a Rollie and a chain
Y'all niggas fake like reed rocks, roll the Ghost, drop the top
Bad bitch, suck the cock, in the crib or in the car
Pussy nigga hate cause I'm a star
Pussy nigga hate like I'ma stop
Pussy nigga wave like who ya are
Pussy nigga skate if around my car
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
You ain't bout that life, you ain't about that yay
You ain't never seen a brick broke down in whole trays
All I know is gunplay
Hit my nigga Gunplay night time, broad day
I just sat in that cage, I done make front page
Kick the door where y'all stay
I ain't even tryna aim, everybody in that bitch catch a stray
I done pushed that drop, I done whipped that Mazi
I done flipped that molly
You ain't seen a dead body, I done held my dope thang
To seen the niggas who shot 'em in they own blood
Had to wipe momma's tears, she dreamin' I'm dead
My niggas gettin' bread, my niggas beat the Feds
Every night I send a photo, my bad
You ain't bout that life, that life, keep 100 shots in that pipe
200 on my dash, thousand grams of that white
Sky Dweller my watch, two kilos my Cuban
Courtside like Mark Cuban, you getting money? Then prove it nigga
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
I'm 'bout that life, when the shit on sight, and they sit on tight
With niggas who snipe, with that big ol' fire, nigga sit on down
You's a goddamn joke, what you out there doin?
You goin' get yourself hurt
This not that movie, these guns really shootin'
And these packs really movin'
I need them M's and y'all niggas still playin'?
I'm tryna build my brand
Lil man can't hear that he got killed for a grand
What the fuck is you saying?
I'm tryna shower my bitches with black balls
Nino Brown someone's baby momma
Fuck nigga, keep talkin' crazy
I'ma buy your bitch and start claiming your daughter nigga
All my work from across the border nigga
If he a fuck nigga, I'll fuckin' shoot him nigga
When we pull up, hoes get starstruck
This Live House, MMG, I'ma teach you fuck niggas to boss up
These pussy ass niggas ain't bout that life
Man these niggas ain't bout that life, naw
And this shit they talkin' I got that twice
Bitch I'm Diddy ho fuck your advice
I said bitch I'm Diddy ho fuck your life
Ho shut your mouth when you in the presence of kings
I ball like LeBron but I got a couple more rings
I got love for all my hatin' niggas I heard you said some things
You bitch niggas need love too I might take you under my wing
Car expensive, jack a nigga
What they know? I head crack a nigga
Shots fired don't ask a nigga
Gangsta got killed by a rappin' nigga
Rollie gold, I'm Michael Corleone
Scarface bitch I got it goin' on
One time for all the feds watchin'
Get inside tips, when your money long
Got big, my plan bigger
I'm a die tryna squeeze my damn trigger
Niggas hate when you touch that 50 M's
Bentley white, I got five of them
Pull up on the corner with shinin' rims
Smiling like a nigga when he got a deal
Dying, always on my mind for real
Empire, always what I want to build
