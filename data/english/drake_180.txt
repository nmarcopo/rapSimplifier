*Lyrics from Snippets*
Ayy, yeah
Trend setter, Ben Frank getter
Whipper dapper, whipper dapper
I buy diamonds when I'm under pressure
When I pop shit, don’t ever let up, yeah
Look, I'm in the cut, the boy in the cut
Jump in the whip when the ceilings go up and up
All of this grindin' for what?
It’s funny when you niggas thought it was luck
I can not give you a pass to just play with my money and family and friends
And I compete with myself while you niggas competin' with trends
Your foreign is used, I looked up the VIN
I know the truth, no use in pretendin' with him
I'm still in the cut, the boy in the cut
Hop in the whip when the ceilings go up...
Go way up at the top of the loft
Gotta stay up, ain't no knockin' me off
Pull up smooth, we out with the crocs, damn
Countin' off wins on wins on wins, for all of my dawgs (/dog) I lost
I'ma dawg (/dog) for real, bitches get Chanel
Thought they got the YSL (You was)
I remember when the feds did this shit, I pray my dawgs didn’t tell
(I remember)
I remember when the feds did this shit, I pray my dawgs didn’t tell
I-I triple with the bitches
