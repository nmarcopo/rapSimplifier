Shoulda spent more nights
Coulda changed your life
We woulda been alright
All these shoulda coulda wouldas
In her ear one time
Prolly wastin’ my time
'Cause she heard it all
'Cause she heard it all
Girl, I coulda changed your life
But she heard it all
Well, I'ma say it anyway shawty
I’m the from the city
Where we were never taught to love
You ain’t gotta be in love to fuck
Girl, I’m just tryna say
I’m the from the city, oh
Where the money makes a difference
But it never made us different, oh
