In the V.I.P. rollin' a cord, passin' out mollies to foreigns

Hop off up in the new Bugatti, cameras flashin' paparazzi
She poppin' that capsule, no Nazi

She suckin' her lip, bitin' down

Holding that pussy for ransom
She sucking me up like a vacuum

Foreign bad bitch with the accent
Dropping the top off the Aston

Snow bunny like I'm Hugh Hefner
Running my sack up like Fletcher
You niggas to slow, need to catch up
My wrist so sick, got a virus
Birds be singing like Maya
Stop drop and roll like a fire
Drop it low like Miley Cyrus
