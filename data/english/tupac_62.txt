(2Pac talking)
Black Cotton
Black Cotton
(Uh yeah)
“I couldn't help but notice you’re pain”
“my pain?”
It run's deep, share it with me”
(Um)
Black cotton
A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is
Listen
(It's gonna get ya’, gonna get ya')
Rotten black cotton in God's eyes
(It's gonna get ya', gonna get ya')
Speak
(It's gonna get ya', gonna get ya’)
(Verse One: 2Pac)
Black Cotton
Steady stressing Smith and Wesson’s count my blessing's
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves? sweating blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave In the nine tre’
Answer that then answer this too
Loves gonna get ya' you know it's true, life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phoney and positive but why be negative?
What’s the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track got you sprung now your hung (Do ya' feel me?)
Dum dum diddy answer me?
Attempt to reach, each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then, at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets, deceased
Looking through my high school yearbook
Reminiscing of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies, poof
We used to have troops but now there's no more, youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of black cotton (Cotton)
In God's eyes
(Chorus)
Mama told me they'd be day's like this but I'm pissed
Rotten black cotton in God's eyes
(Pissed)
Told me they'd be days like this
(They claim that I'm violent)
Rotten black cotton in God's eyes
My mama told me they'd be day's like this but I'm pissed
Rotten black cotton in God's eyes
Yo Mouse man
(They claim that I'm violent)
Hit
(Verse two: Mouse Man)
Black cotton
Rotten as the rest everyday's a test I stress
Protection wear a vest is your best bet
Be on point make sure you're back it's got
Money hungry thinking 'bout the jack pot
Jewels and fat knot's get props
On the corner slanging marijuana wanna get, paid
Wasn't born with the sliver spoon
(Never had it made)
That's why I act up you say I'm crazy lazy
But this is what you gave me don't have enough to feed my baby
If I decide to sell my soul, swallow my pride you can't
Hide from the truth the youth is dying inside
Look out instead of putting a foot out
Shouting about the negative vibe's look in my eyes mad cause they on the prize
No need to wonder on the under try to stay low
I gotta make my mail slanging that just say no
Crack vial's stay in piles on my door step
The future scare's me you don't hear me
A double M is kept, ready to cock
Young black males to the top
Can't be stopped, straight from the school of hard knocks
(Uh)
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black cotton
In God's eyes
Yeah
