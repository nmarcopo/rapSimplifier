Quarter ticket on a drop [?], none of that shit
Think you poppin', need to stop bitchin', not lit
Drinkin' on the syrup, I'm leanin' over, sloppy
One inside the chamber, locked and loaded, cocked it
Way too many chains, dawg
My lawyer do cocaine, dawg
Audemars Piguet plain, dawg
Yo shooters need to hit the range, dawg
If I can't run it up, I'll take some
My baby mama with the shits, she a [?]
She standing like a stallion, mobbing like Italian
I'm in that pussy drowning, nigga broke, he frowning
Pussy get wet like SmartWater
Bitch I got a check, I'll pay for it
Double park the Maybach and they can't tow it
Money so long that the bank owe me
Plenty shopping sprees, Saint Laurent Jeans
Open up my hood with the trunk key
You niggas tryna assassinate my character
Make a nigga pull up and embarrass ya
Tryna cover pain so the ink deep

Lil' bitch, I got you lit, you better thank me
Pull up now and suck me like Lewinsky
Photo drop, yeah

He used to have the juice until his death [?]
I'ma ride with you until the wheels stop
I'ma fuck a couple hoes because I'm real hot
I'm just being real wit' you, yeah
These lame ass niggas can't deal with you, yeah
Turn you up and build wit' you, yeah

You ain't never met a nigga got more then
Pussy get wet like SmartWater
Bitch I got a check, I'll pay for it
Double park the Maybach and they can't tow it
Money so long that the bank owe me
Plenty shopping sprees, Saint Laurent Jeans
Open up my hood with the trunk key
You niggas tryna assassinate my character
Make a nigga pull up and embarrass ya
