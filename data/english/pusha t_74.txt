If you love me, please don't judge me
Got my hands tied, the power's above me
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just a puppet here
If you wanna place blame, then look to the puppeteer
Family, fortune, envy, jealousy
Privilege, passed on legacy
Secret, sabotage, borderline felony
Suicide, subtract, selfish, pedigree
When the love's gone, and the hate's there
Better watch out, 'cause it's Cape Fear
When your family ain't your family
And your legacy is just a name there
In your mother's eyes is a blank stare
But your father's pickin' who remains here
It's a power struggle, it's a tug-of-war
That's amongst the kids, and it ain't fair
Yeugh, who gon' stop the pain?
Who gon' block the dream?
Who gon' stop the shame?
We are not the same
Walkin' a tightrope, ain't a life boat (Nope)
It's a free fall when I leave y'all (Whoa)
(If you love me, please don't judge me
Got my hands tied, the power's above me)
My bloodline was not chosen (Ooh)
This bank account is not frozen
This thing of ours is not broken
What's understood is not spoken
If you love me, please don't judge me
Don't judge me
Family, fortune, envy, jealousy
Privilege, passed on legacy
Secret, sabotage, borderline felony
Suicide, subtract, selfish, pedigree, yeugh
Family, fortune, envy, jealousy
Privilege, passed on legacy
Secret, sabotage, borderline felony
Suicide, subtract, selfish, pedigree, yeugh
