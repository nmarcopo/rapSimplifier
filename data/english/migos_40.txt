She want a Birkin, I told her, "Work it"
She want a Birkin, I told her, "Work it"
She want a Birkin, I told her, "Work it"
She want a Birkin, I told her, "Work it"
She want a Birkin, I told her, "Work it"
She want a Birkin, I told her, "Work it"
She want a Birkin, I told her, "Work it"

That's a whole lotta cash (Cash)
I bought a watch and made it glass (Glass)
And copped lil' coupe so I could drag (Skrrt)
I bought a bag, it made 'em mad (Bag)
I bought the bag just to brag
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo
I put your bitch in the Birkin, I told her to work it
I thought you deserved it (Hey)
I throw that money, she pick it up urgent (Hey)
I'ma put couple mill', go tell lil' birdie (Brr)
Niggas ain't ballin', go put up your jersey
I'm in the Maybach, it came with the curtains (Big bags)
You bought the bag, I heard you was hurtin'
Tryna get thirty big by the time I'm thirty
You bought that jewelry and put on your neck
And I heard it was turnin' (Turnin')
Colors, I bought it, the bag
The Birkin is pink, and told her to work it (Work it)
If you do right for the night, I cop you the mink
The matchin' is perfect (Mwah)
She told me, "Talk to her nice"
Poppin' these Perkies and buyin' these purses (Pop 'em)
Take-Take-Takeoff

I got baddie lil' bitch, she a sassy lil' bitch (Baddie)
She told me go-go for an average bitch (Go-go)
Ratchet, but she livin' lavish, this bitch (Birkin)
This Birkin is nasty (Nasty)
Eighty-five K for these packets (Whoo)
You pockets get put in the casket (Hey)

Ooh, they think I'm Chris Angel, do magic ([?])
They was hatin' on the gang, had Pateks (Pateks)
I can see these niggas mad, I got the baddest (Woo)
I'm happy, this bag came with panties (I'm happy)
Forty-five K for the handle (Forty-five)
Birkin bag real rare like a panda (Rare)
The fur, this mink is an animal (This fur)
They smoke, don't choke, we handle 'em (Don't choke)
I'm the goat, you know I will challenge ya (I'm the goat)
