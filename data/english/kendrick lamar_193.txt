I don't think they heard you why don't you tell them what your name is
I said my name is Kendrick, Lamar
Nigga my name is Kendrick, Lamar
I said my name is Kendrick, Lamar
I can tell you what it is
I can tell you what it isn't
No more K. Dot
My mother had named me Kendrick
Fuck a stage name
That's the name that I was given
The only thing that I can identify with in this business
I'm just a good kid from Compton that wanna rap
Weighing my options pick up a bible or strap
I never kill'd a man
Never sold any crack
All I ever did was try to keep my city on the map
Put Smokey on my back
Y'all don't want me to win
I'm tryna find some dreams y'all want me to follow trends
