Can I, can I save you from you
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you been sipping
Not suppose to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do (yeah)
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making a mistake I never learned from
I swear I always fall for your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type (yeah oh uh oh)
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all (*4X*)
I believe in people like you
Cause who am I to judge you on the past girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before
Uh look, dress hanging off your shoulder barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and startin over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just sayin' shit
And you dance, dance all high, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait, no I get it
Girl I’m wit' it
I’ve been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn
I wonder why I never learn my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and it’s the first impression
And I heard there’s nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man it’s been a while and I swear that this one's different
That’s why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been
And I’m slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I’m just trying to correct it, and I fall
