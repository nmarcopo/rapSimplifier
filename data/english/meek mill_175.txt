Uh, uh, uh, uh
It's Meek motherfucking Milly, uh
BH, all my bitches (all my bitches)
You know I had to get one for the hoes (hoes)
Haha
I said hoes, we never love them
We fuck them and then discuss them
And if you ain't fucking my man, you prolly fucking my cousin
There's nothing, how do we want it
Um, um amazing
Better yet a buffet
You can get all three
But I don't get her number, I tell her to call me
Phone rings she with her friends and they want to party
I tell her meet me, hotel room 13
I be there in a little
Man he little, I sizzle
Step up in the telly, hoes naked already
Looking all sexy, screaming daddy come get it
The dream gods tell me twice, I be right in it
Shorty wetter than a pool, I dive up in it like I'm swimming (splash)
Knocking bitches off, daddy this ain't nothing new
I'm Shaggy baby, would you let my dawgs Scooby Doo
She said that's crazy but I tell her this is what we do
Expect the unexpected, you seen the movie too
Rolling through the block (uh)
Benjis on rock (uh)
Bad bitch on my back, at the twelve o'clock
T-5 barking on them
PT5 tour ass on them
Cops come, double clutch, fist tell that corner on them
Ride hard, fly it off like a Maserati
Getting low when I'm rolling, she gon' ride, she my Bonnie
My mommy, little hottie
Vanilla Ice, check out her eyes and her body
My little right thing
Bitches be on my dick cuz they know I be on some shit
Like if you ain't fucking or sucking, don't even jump in the whip
She ride, tell her jump in (come on)
She ain't tell her to holler
Sliding in that Impala
Grinding, chopping on choppers
Still M.O.B., mommy's don't get a dollar
I'm trying to fuck you for free, if you tricking don't even bother
I'm a P.I.M.P., naked bitches in the 'scala
Put a blue and white Yankees shirt, striped polo with the collar (free)
But everybody know my name
Meek Milly, flow is flames
Plus I got that fire man, Puff just called me Lil Wayne
And I got a little game
Hoes feeling a nigga's swag
Tryna fuck and suck me just to get their niggas mad
See this, I just sit and laugh
You don't want to wife that
You eating her and treating her, see I'm the one who piped that
Soon as I'm finished with her, you can have her right back
If I get a piece of pie, my man gonna slice that
Breakdown, take down, shorty keep your mouth shut
This is what we do, 102, we ain't about that
I don't give a fuck, I leave you stuck like a mousetrap
Middle of the city, tell your rubber to get with me, nigga
Bitch
