Niggas talkin' shit, Push—how do you respond?
I'm top five and all of them Dylan
I am the hope, the dope dealers won
Price and the quote, the dope dealers want
Feds takin' pictures like it's GQ
This Avianne collarbone is see-through
Angel on my shoulder, "What should we do?"
Devil on the other, "What would Meek do?"
Pop a wheelie, tell the judge to Akinyele
Middle fingers out the Ghost, screamin' "Makaveli" (come with me)
Hail Mary, the scale fairy
Two sides to every coin so we bail ready
How do you respond?
I let the monies and the fools talk
I let the jewels and the hues talk
Watch face came with a fuse box
Chanel's on ya bitch
The coupe is 320, the roof's hit or miss
Murder on the highway, the news is at six
See, I did it my way, the proof's in the bricks
Eghck! Smell it through the Tupperware (Tupperware)
Two can get you four like a double dare (woo!)
I'm the king of the oven-ware (oven-ware)
You can piece the whole puzzle here
Niggas talkin' shit, 'Ye—how do you respond?
I am the don of Vuitton
I am the Sean of Sean John (That's the boss nigga)

"Hallway too long, bitch too bad"
Got a surrogate," my kid "gets two dads"
How can one man take a company down?
I can see Nike contemplatin' that
"Like bro, we're fucked, what's the best plan?
I don't know, hire Ye's best man
Maybe sign Travis, sign Don C
Maybe get the [?]"
Ricky came by unattended
Sent Donda out in heaven, up with Avery
I be thinkin', "What would 2Pac do?"
You be thinkin' "What New Kids on the Block do?"
Drizzy wearin' Yeezys on the low though
Only reppin' Nike for promo
The company growin' faster than Flo-Jo
And we did it with no logo
It don't feel right 'til I feel like Phil Knight
Goin' for six rings like what Phil told Mike
What was the six
