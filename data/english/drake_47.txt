Uh, uh-uh
Why are we in Chanel talkin' 'bout life and shit?
Got my emotions on open mic and shit
Fancy, all this pink champagne on ice and shit
Off one glass, girl, I can see how nice you get
Buzzin' your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
Buzzin' your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
I know, you know, I'm in too deep to let it go
I know, you know, it’s in my nature to get distant
I know it's been a year since I left you alone
Unfortunate, I think you know there's somethin' missin'
But you never say shit, don't know how to take it
We're good on our own, but
I miss being on Wiltshire at your place, and
I drink you under tables, got you misbehavin'
Buzzin' in your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
Buzzin' in your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
