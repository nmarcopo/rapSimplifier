Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad men
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young
But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
Two two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young
Now, everytime I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga, it's a God damn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game?
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street, but you'll be sleepin' in the casket
How long will it last? Nigga, don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash, tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head, but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck, motherfuckers, I'm loc
They all duckin' when my gun smoke
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad men
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young
Now, I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin' and drinkin', and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son, we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers, they all die
Been tryin' to make a million by hustlin since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at 8D, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin' with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggas be together
Ain't shit without your homeboys
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune
The music's played by the, the mad men
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever and ever?
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever? Forever young
