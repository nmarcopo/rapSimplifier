Versace Versace Versace
2Pac and Christopher Wallace
Camera flashing, paparazzi
Twenty bitches in the lobby
I just came home from the slammer
Plug sendin' work on bananas
Migo the gang no bandana
Lindsay Lohan and Amanda
Feelin' like Tony Montana, the world is mine,I ain't lyin'
I got babies and pies
No dimes
Three days ago young nigga was sitting doing time
Sick to my stomach, got on my grind
And bought Lambo with no minds
Kickin 'em doors, sellin' them bows , whippin' them O's
Now everything gold
Bentleys and Ross, ain't sellin my soul
My niggas depend on me, M-I-G-O
God is my witness, he know I was gettin' it
Ask for forgiveness for sins I've commited
This ain't no rap, cause a nigga done did it
Don't believe me? Nigga go ask the critics
