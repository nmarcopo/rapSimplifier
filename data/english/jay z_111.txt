Haha, Jay-Z
Roc-A-Fella Records
Circle of success, ha, DJ Self
Hey, check it
The nerve with you herbs
Y'all know who swerve from the curb
In the L-e-x - the best - observe:
Fuck what you heard: splashing, splurging
Dashing, that's my word, you know?
Champagne glasses crashing, can't ration
Used to having a whole lot, so dough, I blow a lot
Had a buck fifty while you was still taking Skippy to school
Ran with one of them niggas that heists Tiffany's for them jewels
Back when Duke was jumping out of Cap'n Crunch food
I was scheming and plotting
Mostly dreaming a lot but look what it got me
4 cars and 400 thousand shots later, fucked up in gators
You scared to look, niggas is shook
Fuck it, you're vibrators
Bullets rank off the hook when niggas try to violate us
FBI spies hate us, all they gotta check is my
Latest cut then follow my moves: I'm the greatest
Fuck how haters been paying dues
I cheated, committed felonies when needed
While you niggas starve, what's this you're making?
If you was hustling like you said
We would've bumped heads, so I know you niggas is faking
Word up - '95 and forever yo, check it
