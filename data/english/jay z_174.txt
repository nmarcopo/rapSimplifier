I fucks with Hova
I want you to know
It's something about you
I fucks with Hova
(I fucks with Hova)
Trackmasters XO
This remix is for you
Let's go!
Untouchable, unbreakable, unshakeable, (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
I got another one!
This is ludicrous! It's preposterous! It's impeccable!
Yes... (Remix!) Yes... Yes... Baby (it's Hova)
First I had streets, then I had the charts
First I had they ear, now I have their heart
Rappers came and went, I been here from start
I see them put it together, watch them take it apart
See the rovers roll up with the ribbons
I see them repo, resold, and re-driven, so when I reload
Leave holes, the number one positions, when you hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'm gonna be that nigga for life
Oh this is not a gimmick
This is God given, this is hard livin'
Mixed with Cristal sippin'
This is the most consistent (Hov!)
Give me the most hits that you can fit inside a double disc
Homie I'm home on these charts, you niggas visitin'
This Hov' tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm about to claim pole position
Holla at ya boy!
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable
Top the untoppable (it's Hovi baby)
Yes... (Remix) Yes... Yes... baby (it's Hovi)
I'm so far ahead of my time
I'm about to start another life
Look behind you, I'm about to pass you twice
Back to the future, got it slow for the present
I'm fast, dude can't get past my past
How do you propose deal with the perfect present
When I unwrap "The Gift & the Curse" with a different verse
And I'm so far ahead of my time
My grandpop just met my grand-mom at a high school prom
And I'm so far ahead of my time
These rhymes is waiting
'Til four years later, they on time release
He'll probably take them, cop your four copy
You realize that every track needed a autopsy
The more tracks I'm on, the more I catch bodies
If not, listen further, you're missing a murder
Like NYPD, LAPD, NYDA, OJ's Jury (yep!)
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable
Top the untoppable (it's Hovi baby)
Yes... (Remix) Yes... Yes... baby (it's Hovi)
Crush linen, what's winning
If it ain't him in the flesh, continue to guess
I'm about to retire my jersey, fuck Mitchell and Ness
I'ma throwback old school kicks in the Vet
Sixty-nine, yeah, same year I was born
Flip the numbers, yeah, same year I got on
Ninety-six, yeah, I used to rhyme with the Don
Shout out to Big, Brooklyn I got this shit
Here is something haters can't figure out
Half a milli first week, man they still Jigga'd out
See, I even sell CD's in the crowd
The hardest dude out since Reasonable Doubt
Hovi Baby, love me, or blow me baby
Fuck you, you'll pay me to owe me baby
They're in denial
Check the charts, I'm wearing you out
I'm about to drop The Black Album in a year
And I'm out
Can't touch the untouchable, break the unbreakable
Shake the unshakeable (it's Hovi baby)
Can't see the unseeable, reach the unreachable
Do the impossible (it's Hovi baby)
Can't move the unmoveable, stop the unstoppable
Top the untoppable (it's Hovi baby)
Yes... (Remix) Yes... Yes... baby (it's Hovi)
