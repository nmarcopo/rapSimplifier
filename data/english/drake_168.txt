*Lyrics from Snippets*
Ayy
It was meant to happen, the most trusted going triple platinum
Link with Mac, link with P if I'm down in Baton (/and battin'?)
Link with Cans link with C, when I'm down in Jackson
Just got back overseas, I was the main attraction
This ain't them, this is me so you know what's crackin'
I mean there's not even a doubt, you know what I'm about
Before I made it out, I said, "I got to make it out"
And I did, I did, I really did
Flippin' cinnamon, grabbin' on instruments
