*Lyrics from Leak*
Ah (Ah), yeah (Yeah)
Used to want a rollie, rollie, rollie with a dab of ranch
So I put that Pyrex in my hood and made an avalanche, gang
Rollie (Rollie), rollie (Rollie)
Bust down, niggas can't hold me (Bust down)
Sip 19' 'till I OD (OD)
Feeling like Julio own me (Own me)
Chillin', just me and my woadies (Gang)
Buck on the law, we brodies (Skrt, skrt)
Lambo' clean, we dirty, skate off
Judge might give me thirty, take off
Pullin' thru to scoop that thot (Thot)
Snatch that ho out the radar (Radar)
Boy, you too, too hot (Hot)
Niggas took shot, they missed, they way off (Brr)
Told me it wasn't my time
Patek-Phillipe, I ball, no play-offs
Niggas can't stop my grind, I put in all of the work 'til it pay off
Ain't no chill (Chill)
Niggas can't shut me up (Shut up)
Big B's on my wheels (Skrrt)
I just levelled up (Levels)
Shawty know the deal (Deal)
She gon' let me fuck (Hit it)
I'm a Navy Seal, I get that hoe touched
That's your ho, for me, she goin' all the way
I ain't know, 'cause that ho just a call away
Went to jail with some bracelets the other day
Got her stored in my phone under Cartier, hey
Cartier, let her level up the boss for a day
I'm Miami, we gon' ball, D-Wade
Diamond choker, she a doll for the day
Ayy, put in designer, 'Bana
She can do what [?] (Handle that)
She hood like [?] (Hood)
Put it in your throat, don't vomit (Eugh, ah)
Turn into a zombie (Hoo)
Hoppin' in the jet, cross country
She blow it like a trumpet, but I ain't cum
But I really wanna cousin, you
Yeah (Yeah), I'm a player (Player)
Pinky ring (Ring), Kyrie layup (Bling, bling)
Walkin' like the king, apart these bitches, yeah (King of pop)
Bad bitch got the meanest top, put in Chanel (Chanel)
Buckle your seatbelt (Buckle up)
Get right on top of me, come one and ride (Ride)
Might buy you a Jeep, yeah (Jeep)
Only, only if you can survive (Only)
I fuck her to sleep, yeah (Woo)
Slippery, slippery, watery slide (Slippery)
We both get geeked up (Geek)
Give me the top, it's the perfect vibe (Hey)
That's your ho, for me, she goin' all the way
I ain't know, 'cause that ho just a call away
Went to jail with some bracelets the other day
Got her stored in my phone under Cartier, hey
Cartier, let her level up the boss for a day
I'm Miami, we gon' ball, D-Wade
Diamond choker, she a doll for the day
Ain't no chill (Chill)
Niggas can't shut me up (Shut up)
Big B's on my wheels (Skrrt)
I just levelled up (Levels)
Shawty know the deal (Deal)
She gon' let me fuck (Hit it)
I'm a Navy Seal, I get that hoe touched
That's your ho, for me, she goin' all the way
I ain't know, 'cause that ho just a call away
Went to jail with some bracelets the other day
Got her stored in my phone under Cartier, hey
Cartier, let her level up the boss for a day
Out in Miami, we gon' ball, D-Wade
Diamond choker, she a doll for the day

Scoop that bitch out her panties
Pull out the wraith to the mansion
Fakers, fakers, fakers, fakers

It look like like a sandwich
I turn the bitch into a
