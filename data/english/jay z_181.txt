Uh, Yeah
Tone Hooker y'all
It's a beautiful thing you know
If you want it
We got it
If you want it
We got it (baby)
Now we got mystical street visions of making multiple Deniro
The mula makes the gods fly but we don't need another hero
While gun runners be steady gun toting
I'm on a seven day cruise laying, flowing steady rocking the boat
And the champaign got me feeling eerie
My style got me spilling liquor for niggas locked on the island
Baby brother could be the man soon
Living lovely, laying up in luxury sailing to Cancun
Mehico, You know the math kid we get cabbage
Let me go, Let's take a break from all these wild savages streets
I burst the flow in places ????, comeback on another day
So we can handle these brinks in a better way and
That's how it had to be and Ladies are mad at me when
Word on the street the men calling me there majesty and
It must be true I heard it from the Caribbean's
Well I'm in love with the last sexy black Mohican
My game is ultra magnetic-al, While I'm steady G'ing
Remember me if not the bubbly, the Hennessy and
Acknowledge my wisdom then understand my culture street and
Redefine this powerful life back from the Europeans
So I keep making motions, Plus avoid all my failures
Without chocking, I'm smoking on potent paraphenelia
Ghetto Celeb's keeping love, love
We bomb the world with musical drugs and fly live a dove
If you want it (baby)
We got it (baby)
If you want it (Make it happen everyday of you're life, baby)
We got it (baby)
If you want it (baby)
We got it (baby)
If you want it (Every night)
We got it (baby)
(Jay-Z: What The Fuck)
Roc-A-Fella gang, Suit Up
Stay fly from the boot up
Like, computer
Till you die get you're loot up
Do what you like, It's still in me
When assets become liability's
Back to dealing G's
But feeling these
To bomb like Lebanese
Forever cheese
I'm dead stain to blow and lit like gas lane(?)
Vast game, Live out my life like a movie
Till the last rain, blasting the ooze, till I'm woozy
Gordo at $12.99 a CD
Jay-Z & Tone Hooker is ???
Blasting in the auto
The crystal got me thinking about more though
Watch out girl, If I needed
I can't be stopped, Won't be defeated
I come to take you're shit you gotta leave it
If I want it I got the guns for it player run it
Ready to die, Roc-A-Fella style for a couple of hundreds
Fowl, Nothing less than six digits out my mouth (uh-huh)
If i ain't platinum soon then It's back down south (say what)
Ill built like whatever y'all I'm back on the set
Came to claim what I left because my name still rep
Even though, player ain't been seen, been on the low
Except on the screen (uh), Tryna blow up my flow
It's an all out thing, No time to front
We make it happen, yeah we go it locked down
Fuck y'all want
For all y'all laughing dudes
Trying to knock this get money music
Roc-A-Fella Y'all
Trying to have it like the havers have it
You Know
Not wish it like the wishers want it
Yeah, We talking 'bout
Getting this cake and what not
But I'll tell you what
What ever heads you know, struggling
And ain't trying to get money
You keep them cats away from me
You understand, ha
