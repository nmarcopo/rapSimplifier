I’m fucking with your bitch
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich
I might go buy a brick
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich
Whip it up like dough
Brick white and it look like snow
I’m cooking on my stove
Straight rollin’ you already know
You already know it’s sold
You already know I’m gone
I’m gone off dro I’m blown
Don’t know if I’ll make it home
Bitch I’m rolling off that molly
Smoking on that molly
Drinking on Bacardi while I’m stunting through the lobby
Got more bitches down in Follies shaking that for 20 dollars
Young rich niggas all around me
Bitch we ain’t nothing but some ballers
