It's the Roc! Wooo!
Nike Airs is right (check)
My bucket is low (check)
My Rocawear is fittin' incredible
Fuck it, I guess I got my swagger back
Mama, they said I killed a man
Well, I guess I got the dagger back
It's the Roc, bastards, we are BACK!
In the heezy
Jigga Man, B. Sige to M-Easy (what up, fam?)
Oschino and Sparks and Freeweezy (holla!)
Mickey, Mallory, Chris and Neef, hey!
All I need is the love of my crew
The whole industry can hate me, I thugged my way through
And all, I, need is a chick that hold a jammy
Like Meth and Mary, like Marvin and Tammi, uhh
Now understands we can't be stopped
From blowin' Swisher Sweets outta candy drops
Like we underground kings, ridin' dirty
A nigga been focused since I said hi to 30 (what up?)
Young niggas, y'all can't hurt me
Better watch and observe me
And learn how to earn better, I burn cheddar
I set fire to your empire
I blow smoke in your face, burn rubber off of rim tires
Yes I-ah, Jay I-ah...
Double G-A, livewire nigga, holla back!
All I need...
Rocawear... (check)
Nike Airs... (check)
Mean bucket... (uh huh)
Armadale in the club, couple of duckets (yeah)
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride
All I need...
That new coupe (got that)
A doo-rag and a pocket full of loot (got those)
A sunny day, some chicks they wanna play
And I'll be on my way
Come on… now
All I need in this world of sin
Is me and my girlfriend! (ha ha)
I got a little two-two, I call her Peggy Sue
When I'm off in the club she fit right in my shoe (wooo!)
Gotta switch her to my waist, just in case (uh huh)
A clown wanna flip, gotta reach for my bitch
Wanna act out a movie, I could give you a clip (buck!)
But no ad-libbin', nigga, stick to the script
Now all, I, need is a high-priced lawyer
'Cause it's foul ways nowadays, everybody saw you
And they comin' to court too, I thought you knew
Can't even steal on a nigga, muh'fuckas will sue
In this time and age, what's a real muh'fucka to do
When I'm surrounded by squeal muh'fuckas like you?
But real niggas don't fret 'cause the number one crew
R to the O to the C comin' true
All I need...
Rocawear... (check)
Nike Airs... (check)
Mean bucket... (uh huh)
Armadale in the club, couple of duckets (yeah)
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride
All I need...
That new coupe (got that)
A doo-rag and a pocket full of loot (got those)
A sunny day, some chicks they wanna play
And I'll be on my way
Listen, the cream too long, my team too strong
Bleek is too hot, Beans is gone
Y'all niggas in the crosshair, the beams is on (see y'all)
Y'all whole block deserted, y'all fiends are gone (bye bye!)
The whole Roc is jumpin', we reached our zenith
Got fiends throwin' up on themself like Willie Beamen (hehe hehe)
Any given Sunday gunplay's optional
However niggas want it like Soul II Soul (however do you waant it?)
Whoever got hops get blocked, go to the hole
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit
Plus the jab is sick, and it's Zab quick
Left hand'll lean 'em like a little past six
Now run along wit'cha little-ass hits
Read my rap sheet, nigga: three classics!
Shut your bumba', I got A-Rod numbers
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk
When I blast the pump
I leave you relaxed in the hospital, lookin' at M*A*S*H for months
Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk
And I flee scot-free and pee-pee on the steps
We've got no respect, no law or governin'
Why you fuckin' with him?
Matter fact, why you fuckin' with them?
All y'all need is the R-O-C, baby
All I need...
Rocawear... (check)
Nike Airs... (check)
Mean bucket... (uh huh)
Armadale in the club, couple of duckets (yeah)
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride
All I need...
That new coupe (got that)
A doo-rag and a pocket full of loot (got those)
A sunny day, some chicks they wanna play
And I'll be on my way
Listen
(All I need)
Roc-A-Fella Records
Freeway, Oschino and Sparks, Chris and Neef
(All I need)
Mickey and Mallory
