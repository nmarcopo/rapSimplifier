Check
Here I am
The man
I'm swinging and singing and bringing
The light to the mic
Again
Together forever
Endeavour, to always prevail
Well
Whatever the weather
I'm better
You seem to pale
In comparison
Jay-Z's embarrassing
Your time after
Riggity-rhyme master
The liggity-last Jay-Z rhyme
So you can say I'm
So pro fade line
Peace
