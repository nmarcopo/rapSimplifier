She said, 'Do you love me?"
I tell her "Only partly,"
"I only love my bed and my momma I'm sorry"
50 dubs, I even got tatted on me
81 they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the 02 to the 03 dog
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never left the broskies
God's plan, God's plan
(Yah-ah)
Yeah, they wishin'
Yeah, they wishin'
Oh yeah!
