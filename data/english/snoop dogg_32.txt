High speed chase, 405 is the freeway
Slangin' my- bangin' my- swangin' my Coupe de Ville
Scoop DeVille
Like that, right back, top of the hill
Wheel in my hand with a trunk full of contraband
Swimmin' under water like I'm Aquaman
I used to drink gin, now it's vodka, man
Boss Dawg is the baller, no propagand'
I'll pop yo band, don't try and stop the plan
I'll rock your land, step back and pop yo man
Spaced out, caked out, no bug-a-boo
Flipped out, Cripped out, nigga, what it really do?
Time brings change, so I changed my name
Tryna take flight while they clippin' my wings
Groupie ass niggas, see you tripping again
With nothing to gain, plop plop, pop and I bang
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up
Thirty days later I'm back on the streets
Got a batch of bomb beach, shit I'm trying to eat
Feet to the pavement; money, I'm cravin' it
What about the bitches Dogg? Are you savin' 'em?
Can a blind man see? (No)
Can a shark survive outta water for a week? (No)
A snitch is a snitch if he solemnly speak
I don't know near nothin', I'm a product of the beach
To each his own, hard as stone
Lot of y'all niggas 'bout as hard as foam
Dead wrong, tryin' to sneak Tamika the phone
Step back nephew or feel the heat of the chrome
G-ma and PawPaw and the heat of my comb
Plate full of shit nigga, I never eat it alone
Heat it alone, then I put the weed in the bong
Step back at the feet of my throne mothafucka
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up
Cinematic, right back at it
Talk the walk and walk 'bout that static
I am the extra dramatic
When he popped back, everybody scattered, didn't matter
I was there from the get-go
Movin' heavy weights, Klitschko
Rookies and cookies from 'Frisco
Put 'em in a box, Nabisco
We the funk that killed disco
I showed you how to go and get this dough
And I'm the reason why you're fuckin' with this ho
But don't thank me, that's how the shit go
It's still banging Crypto from the intro
Nigga what they hidden fo'?
Hol' up, who is that tryin' to come through?
Step back and get mic checked; 1, 2
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up
Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine
Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine
Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine
Grapevine, state line
Get yours, I take mine
Cadillac-er, Croco-sacker
Hip-hopper, click-clacker
Tip-tapper, pimp-slapper
Ain't tryna act up, don't wanna act up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (aye back up)
Aye, baby back up, baby back up
My nigga back up, nigga back up (back up)
Hey Scoop DeVille, turn the track up
