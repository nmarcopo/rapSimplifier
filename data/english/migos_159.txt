Yo, Migo

So niggas wanna hate on me
So niggas wanna plot on me
They're jealous, and they envy me (why?)
Cause I'm really, who they wanna be
I ain't never did a sneak diss
Call my hitman quick to put you on the hit list
I guess they mad cause we young and rich
I guess they mad cause we fucked their bitch
First off B.I.G. may you rest in peace
Killed my nigga Pac and Biggie over jealousy
Vegetarian shooter, he gon' kill ‘bout that celery
Hollow tip that sang it for you, here, feel the melody
Niggas plottin' while I’m on vacation in Beverly
Offset told me press the button like the game of Jeopardy
I’m pressing it, niggas wanna hit me for my necklaces
Diamonds VVS, but that juug was never sent for
You either respect or like Nike, we checkin' you
You fuck nigga try me, my niggas go reckless
Never will you catch me naked, young Mel Gibson, kill lethal weapons
Stomping a fuck nigga out, with thousand dollar Giuseppe's
Boss shit, only boss niggas, in my section
So niggas wanna hate on me
So niggas wanna plot on me
They're jealous, and they envy me (why?)
Cause I'm really, who they wanna be
I ain't never did a sneak diss
Call my hitman quick to put you on the hit list

I guess they mad cause we fucked their bitch
Hey hold on, hold on, where Takeoff at?

I’m heating these niggas in 'sace jacket, that’s a $1800 sweater
I’m getting to that cheddar, my life is so better
Fuck nigga mad, ‘cause I’m a trendsetter
Chain got rocks so, I’m looking at your pebbles
I’m rocking the stage and I keep heavy metal
I got the ether like Nas, I’m strapped up with ammo and bombs
I’m telling my nigga go get you because of the money, it itching they palms
"Prrrm doom doom" that’s a hundred round drum
On Sunday in church with my moms
I'm Asking the lord for forgiveness because he know the dirt that I've done
So niggas wanna hate on me
So niggas wanna plot on me
They're jealous, and they envy me (why?)
Cause I'm really, who they wanna be
I ain't never did a sneak diss

Fuck nigga you saying we dissing?
Mistletoe chopper, them bullets, come kissing
Don’t enter Atlanta without no permission
Leave ‘em stanking like chitlins
Got niggas that come threw your chimney
Like the Grinch that stole Christmas
Did a 8 month sentence, I did it, came home to the riches
You niggas ain’t relevant, pussy they pecking that melony
Offset the veteran, putting the pack on the measurement
You niggas got so much jealousy, I keep the pistol with felonies
Young nigga I'mma have to teach you a lesson
"Glaw! Glaw!" Hit his ass with a Smith and Wesson
Can't go back to jail cause this shit is depressing
So niggas wanna hate on me

They're jealous, and they envy me (why?)
Cause I'm really, who they wanna be
