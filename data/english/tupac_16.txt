Haha, aight
Storm, motherfuckers
Ain't really knowin' if you can flow or not
So, do this shit like last time
Holler my name, nigga, you ridin' to scream
Must be a thug with a heart to be a part of my team
It seems we got a problem
We ain't lettin' no women and the feminine side
Has been denied time to give 'em a try
Finally made it, now focus
Now who the dopest?
The brothers or the sisters
I agree, it's a man's world, but why must niggas diss us
I ain't tryin' to hear it, witness my thug spirit
They keep on screamin' 'bitches'
'Cause niggas love to hear it
Called on my dawgs, 'cause they rowdy then a motherfucker
I love you niggas like brothers, but don't fuck with me
Oh bad now, look what we got
Miss Billy Badass runnin' round, packin' double Glocks, uh
So all you niggas be warned
From the dusk til the dawn
We might trip, but I dare you tricks to fuck around with Storm
We Outlawz
I said it and meant it
And when you see me live on TV
It's strictly representin'
Now, let me hear you scream
This is for my niggas
Only for my niggas
For my niggas
Let me see you throw your hands up
This is for my sistas
Only for my sistas
For my sistas
Let me see you throw your hands up
Verse 2
Now when I say Pig
You say B-I-G
When I say Bad Boy killer
Then you say me
When I say Puffy is a punk, you scream word on my life
I wrote this shit while fuckin' Big's wife
Now I been told that Lil Kim thinks she hot
She not
Better get that additude adjusted 'fore I mash your spot
Plus now Da Brat's trippin'
Must want an ass whippin'
We be the first ones to fuck with you and Bad Boy, weak bitch
Bustin' through Brooklyn, lickin' my shots to Queens
'Cause I'm lookin' for Little Shawn, that bitch ass fiend
I made him scream like last year
Best don't come to California, we don't want your busta ass here
We outlaw, ryders, thugs til we die
Sistas get they groove on
Niggas gettin' high
Call me a motherfuckin' troublemaker
Send me to jail
But watch me bust on LL
Now let me hear you scream
This is for the riders
Only for the riders
For the riders
Let me see you throw your hands up
This is for the riders
Only for the riders
For the riders
Let me see you throw your hands up
This is for the bitches
Only for the bitches
For the bitches
Let me see you throw your hands up
This is for them bustas
Only for them bustas
For them bustas
Let me see you throw your hands up
This is for my niggas
Only for my sistas
For my riders
Let me see you throw your hands up
Look at it, did it
We up outta here
2Pac and Storm
Outlaw Immortalz
Death Row, west side
THUG LIFE, beyatch...
