My bitch don't speak no English, my plug don't talk on the phone
So every time I wanna re up, gotta take a flight to Hong Kong
I had to wrap the bands on up, I had to wrap the pack on up
I pour codeine in a double cup, 2 black 1 white like it double stuffed
I'm the first play winner you a runner up, Got bands on me like a brink truck
Now I got yo' bitch in the condo, and she laying their with her knees up
Every time I walk out the jeweler its a freezer
Every time I cash out I got to walk around with that Nina
You walk around with that cake on you
Got a watch out for them people who hate on you
Might pull up in a drop top coupe
With a foreign bad bitch from Honolu
Honoluu Hawaii for the local nigga that don't know
But I gotta walk around with a big ass bankroll
Baaaaannnnnnnkkkkkkk
Bankroll
Baaaaaaaaaankroll
And what you need
Bankroll Bankroll Bankroll
Baaaaaaaaaank
Baaaaaaaaaankroll
And what you need
Bankroll Bankroll Bankroll Bankroll Bankroll
Wanna talk about bankroll, they don't really wanna talk about it
Fuckin' with that white so much change my last name new white like Rowdy
Pull up in a Kawasaki, or might drive a Maserati
I dreamed I pull out that rover, I might just call my chauffeur
Put LV on my loafers, chop it up with the poor like Oprah
Snotty baby no stroller, in the VIP standing on the sofa's
Young Takeoff God got big bankrolls, call me Santa Clause i got ho-ho-hoes
Ten bands for my bracelet, eight bands and them dudes start fighting
Trap booming like I'm doing , strike a nigga ass like lighting
Exotic bitch named Mandy got her on the zannie's
2012 Bentley Panorama and you know i got them..
Got big ass bankroll on me, made them foreign hoes come want me
Many young niggas wanna clone me, but you gotta know there's only one me
Got 2 bad bitches in the Lambo, I need all my bands like pronto
No cash then it ain't no convo, lookin' for the money where's Waldo?
Sippin lean out the pint, walking around with a bank
I got a bitch come from Spain, I don't even know her name
She just whip up them thangs, I go buy the new chain
Then I hit the lot up, go and cop that new Range
All I wanna do is go run to the money
Run to the money while the money keep coming
Got a bad bitch with me and she come from London
Whippin' up a brick and we smokin' out an onion
Bankroll stupid, left wrist Franck Muller
TRU Religion jeans make her think that I'm buddha
Bad bitch with me and she come from Cuba
And the wife from Cuba and you know I got them...
