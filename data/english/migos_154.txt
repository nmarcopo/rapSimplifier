ATL, what's up, man?
You ain't never flip no work in yo' life (In yo' life)
You ain't never hit the curb in yo' life (In yo' life)
Got 'em bricks, they from Mexico, Mexico
Got the plug for the Shawty Lo
You ain't never flip no work in yo' life (In yo' life)
You ain't never hit the curb in yo' life (In yo' life)
Got 'em bricks, they from Mexico, Mexico
Got the plug for the Shawty Lo
Yeah, yeah, Quavo
You ain't never flip no brick
You ain't never hit no lick
I pull up in six, yo' bitch, she cookin' that chick
Finessin' that bitch
I'm leanin' like kickstand (LA Leakers, baby)
I'm coolin' with Kingston
My nigga, you ain't never hit a jug
With 'bout five miggas in the Nissan
My nigga, they takin' the sack, they jug for fuckin' no reason
They cookin', they whippin' the Birdies, no drought in my season
Hundred racks stashed in my shoe box
Rockin' Versace like 2Pac
Pull up and I got Bazookas, got rings like Slick the Ruler
Pull up in Bermuda, my ice is so cooler, shout to my jeweler
My bitch is way cuter, she came with a cutie
Her daddy from Cuba
You ain't never flip no work in yo' life (In yo' life)
You ain't never hit the curb in yo' life (In yo' life)
Got 'em bricks, they from Mexico, Mexico
Got the plug for the Shawty Lo
You ain't never flip no work in yo' life (In yo' life)
You ain't never hit the curb in yo' life (In yo' life)
Got 'em bricks, they from Mexico, Mexico
Got the plug for the Shawty Lo
I'm the best plug in the city, you fired
Feelin' like 50, "Get Rich or Die Tryin'"
Give me a nick for Amanda Bynes
I'm whippin' the racks, the babies is cryin'
J's, they snortin', my jumpin' like Jordan
When the pack come in, they standin' in line
Gas in my lungs, I'm callin' up Sean
We go to Jamaica to fuck with Diego
No B.o.B, but you know I got haters
We kickin' that flavor on top of skyscraper
The way that I grind, you think I'm a skater
The paper, the baker, I'm drinkin' on maple, connected like cable
My coupe is disabled, QC is the label, got dope on the table
Benjamin Franklins is older than SEGA
Now 100 will get you a plan on the label
I am the plug in the socket
In my pocket, rocket in my Versace
Come to my hood, you payin' a fine
My niggas extorting for dollar signs
You ain't never flip no work in yo' life (In yo' life)
You ain't never hit the curb in yo' life (In yo' life)
Got 'em bricks, they from Mexico, Mexico
Got the plug for Shawty Lo
You ain't never flip no work in yo' life (In yo' life)
You ain't never hit the curb in yo' life (In yo' life)
Got 'em bricks, they from Mexico, Mexico
Got the plug for Shawty Lo
Trap hard, stuntin' on the store, you ain't did it?
I was gettin' dope in the pen on a visit
As a young nigga, I was movin' quarters
I'm wrappin' a brick, they gettin' deported
You sayin' you been trappin', I never seen It
I'm keepin' the O's, you a ballerina
Do yo' research, I been movin' the work
Got drugs like CVS Pharmacy clerk
Yo' bitch got bashed, stashed in her purse
Run up on Migo gang, get put in a hearse
That life you talk is a lie
The streets is jungle, you got to learn how to survive  (LA Leakers, my house)
Bitch bench press, but I be movin' weight
It's a trail of dope on the interstate
Touchdown on the plug, run up in and say, "You livin' a lie," and he caught the case
You flexin' like Popeye wit' spinach
Got three birds in the bottom of the engine
Pull out the rocket, he pussy, he flinchin'
You trappin' and cappin', but don't got no witness
You ain't never flip no work in yo' life (In yo' life)
You ain't never hit the curb in yo' life (In yo' life)
Got 'em bricks, they from Mexico, Mexico
Got the plug for the Shawty Lo
You ain't never flip no work in yo' life (In yo' life)
You ain't never hit the curb in yo' life (In yo' life)
Got 'em bricks, they from Mexico, Mexico
Got the plug for the Shawty Lo
