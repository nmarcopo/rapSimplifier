Lyrics from Snippet 1
Hope my daughter isn't born with a piece of my heartbreak
You know stress carries on, now your kids reap the mistakes that you made

Lyrics from Snippet 2
...like Prince Rogers

But who's to blame when the crowd start cheering and they passing dirty looks?
I now understand that I'll never be understood
Isolation didn’t work for me
Socializing didn't work for me
