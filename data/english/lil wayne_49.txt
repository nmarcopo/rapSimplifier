*Lyrics from Snippets*
...cool
Hop on this thing and send me to the moon
You can just hate me, when you know just what to do
Whenever you see me, I be with them goons
We ain't gon' face 'em but we got 'em too
Yeah, water on me like a pool (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bah, in the back (Bah)
Gettin' tens and that bit Guwop (Bah)
.223 that bitch gon' bop (Bah)
