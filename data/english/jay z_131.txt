You got starch in your flow
I flow too many ways
Got an arch in my flow
All songs are flow
Rembrandt, Rilke
I am art with the flow
Even if I'm guilty
You gotta pardon the flow
Niggas takin' me lightly
Had to darken the flow
Way I put it together
Tear 'em apart with the flow
I'm too smart with the flow
You just started to flow
Stop it youngin'
You 106 & Park with the flow
One Million
Two Million
Three Million
Four
I am the used spirit
I am y'all with the flow
Troubled man, dare I say
I am all with the flow
I come apart
But I evolve with the flow
Crossover, slam dunk
Rucker Park with the flow
Young!
