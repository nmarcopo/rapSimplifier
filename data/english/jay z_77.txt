You plan to bang, I plan to bang too
You playin' the games, I'm seein' the thing through
You sayin' my name to entertain ya crew
I ain't playin' no games, when shots exchange you're through
Fresh off probation I got a charge to throw away
My lawyer say for eighty large it'll go away
And that ain't no money to Jay
So you could get it broad day on Broadway while TRL's tapin'
You playin the game you know you ain't gon' win
Quit playin them childish games with grown men
I don't give a fuck about cars or chrome rims
I got apartments you could put your home in
Can I live?
Can I keep goin'? I wrote... Can I keep goin'?
Do not put my verse on y'all records dawg!
{Laughing}
The boy trap money like bear hunters
Dear Summer, I know y'all gonna miss me
For we been together like Nike Air's and crisp T's
S. Dot's and Polo fleece's
Purple label shit with the logo secret
Gimme a couple of years, shhh, I might just sneak in
A couple of words and like Peaches & Herb
We'll be reunited and it feel so hood
Got the whole world sayin' "How he still so good?"
Well I do this in my slumbers, Summer
I ain't none of these half-assed new comers, you know how I do Summer
I drop heat when you bring the sun up
The combo make niggas act up I pick the gun up
Niggas back up they know I ain't no fronter
I don't talk shit I just flip and "Un" ya
Sorry Lance I'm just tryna advance my quotes
I ain't makin' you the butt of my jokes
Let's not stray from what I came to say
To my beloved, I think we need some time away
They say if you love it
You should let it out the cage, if not fuck it
If it comes back you should know it's there to stay
It's tuggin, at my heart but this time apart is needed
From the public, should've gave me the Pulitz'
But instead gave me they ass to kiss
But you know me, thugging till the casket dips
But still shine light down on all my peers
I know they weird, some queer, I still want them to share
In all the success I receive, I know you can't believe
I still love 'em but they don't love me
They like the drunk uncle in ya
{Laughing}
Though they lame it's still the same still you love 'em the same
Like when cats make subliminal records
Know they can't directly direct it at me I don't respect it
And you don't really want it with Hov for the record
I put a couple of careers on hold - you could be next kid
You keep entering the danger zone
You gonna make that boy Hov put your name on a song
If you that hungry for fame cocksucker, c'mon!
Say when, take ten paces and spin
But on another note I'm bout to take another va-cay on another boat
Goddamn a motherfucker rode his way out the hood
And I pray that I stay out for good
But any day you know a nigga could try to play like he Suge
Then I gotta pull it like Dutch Schultz
You pass the Dutchy I'll blast you trust me
Niggas can't fuck with me
I'm in a good mood y'all lucky
I'm in a good groove
And I ain't tryin to mess my thing up
But I will lay down a couple green bucks, get you cleaned up
Non-Pulp Fiction, Colt 4-fifth and
Young niggas that blasphemy, blast for me, no religion
Yo, I'mma stop Flex, I don't want nobody to catch feelings
I had to take off the blazer, loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth, Superman is alive
{Laughing}
