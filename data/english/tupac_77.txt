Bury me a G
Tell me how can I survive
Remember me? Life as a G
These money making activities is killin' me
I'm tryna ball but this alcohol making me hurl
Paranoid like its me against the world
Will I live or die?
My only question: When I ride will I be murdered, a victim of some homicide, did I deserve it?
My life is full of misery
Forgive me Lord
The streets are full of enemies watch over me
Intoxicated I can barely see
I can't sleep having dreams somebody's killing me
Am I sane?
My life is pain and I'm stressin'
Brothaz be trippin'
They open fire where I rest
Hopin' for death
But I'm still livin' every breath
Won't be for me
Retaliation every death
Lets make em' bleed
Cause do or die is the only way
And though I pray
I can see you getting sicker everyday
And I ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die they don't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
See I ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die they don't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
Something about this game that keep a shory holler for pain
But when the ???jump from the front??? I'mma do my thing
I got problems, so I loc'd up, when they killed my parents
??? so i took the hit for granted, and a revolver will be my only hope for escape, talking 'bout doing the same
But the feeling can wait, who can you blame on these inner-city streets?
They screaming out 'Peace!', but everybody is deceased
Just bury me a G...
Nah, I ain't afraid, just pary that I make top-grade
In the stray, getting paid is the way i play (what?) for keeps
