Lyrics from Snippet
Stretch my hands to you
The Franklin Saint that broke the bank
Shiftin' the culture, they say I taint
I owe my ties, the check is blank
Who are you to question how I show thanks?
We don't pray to the same God, wager the same odds
My Saint Tropez don't relate to your Saint odds
Three or four rappers are sharin' the same lies
Lil' Pusha T, my synergy saved lives
Mirror my excellence for me is exercise
Feelin' like exodus, tryna get next to God
This is an exorcist, see through to my ex's eyes
Hopin' my ex forgive all of my extra lies (Woo)
Life goes on and babies born
And mines on the way couldn’t wait to say it in song
I don't question God's love, 'cause every good and perfect gift is from above
