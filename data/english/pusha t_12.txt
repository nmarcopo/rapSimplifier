Uh, ah, fuck it, we all poor
Even if you got money, still lookin' for more
Why am I buyin' Rollies? I got 20 for sure
Still connect witchu, it's still hid in the drawer
With no Js on, I'm still lookin' to score
You see they gave us crack, then started wagin' a war
Uh, all these lies, they steady tellin' me
Before Obama, we had Eric B. (Woo)
Or Tony Lewis out in D.C.
The '80s kingpins, gotta free them
All these faces, they ain't believe in
If no child's left, then how can we leave them?
When love is gone, you hold onto anything
Some do wrong, just to feel anything
But when the void is filled, you stand up to anything
When love is real, you can do anything
(You can do anything)
Uh, I do it for my big Benz drivers (Drivers)
For my street-corner survivors (Survivors)
For my niggas that miss The Wire (Woo)
And throwback mamis, that won't retire
Reminiscin' on the days
When the trips was Cancún and the bottles got sprayed
You can't relate 'cause you wasn't there
Nah, you wasn't hot, let me make it clear
Y’all was breakin' into cars, we was breakin' bad
When y’all was fightin' dogs, we was racin' Jags
This the life for the fast
Ain't no future, ain't no past, we won't worry 'bout the crash, uh
Now it's jail poses and club pictures
Airbrush backdrops and jail visits
This the dope boy song for the dope boys gone
Let 'em know it's still snowin'
When love's withdrawn, you hold onto anything
(You hold onto anything)
Some do wrong, they have to do anything
(They have to do anything)
But when the void is filled, you stand up to anything
(You stand up to anything)
When love is real (When love is real)
You can do anything (You can do anything)
I'm speakin' to the soul of my black native bros
Who ain't get to go to school like a J. Cole
Who ain't have a silver spoon or a bankroll
Who weren't taught the golden rule, but they made do?
Free lunches and apple juices, uh
Food stamps, ashamed to use 'em
You ever lived with the user?
Shared a bed with abusers, that's the worst way to lose 'em
New plan, but it's a new day
Black people past their due date
Settin' the captives free in a new way
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
It's a new day, black people past their due date
Settin' the captives free, in a new way
Said it's not over, it's not over
Yes, it's just started, it's just started
When love is strong, you can do anything
Things go wrong, but you'll stand up to anything
(But you'll stand up to anything)
'Cause when the void is filled, you can do anything
(When the void is filled)
When the love is real, you can do anything
