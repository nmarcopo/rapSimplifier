I just wanna wake up in the morning
Drop the top like I'm a samurai
I just wanna a hunna mill
House up on the hill
Sippin' out the seal
Lookin' at the sun rise
I just wanna look like  I'm a champion
I just wanna plug that's a Italian
I just wanna live better than average
I just wanna (x3)
I just wanna live up in the penthouse
I just want two bitches and they give me mouth
I just wanna make it out this motherfucking trap house
I just wanna (x3)
1991 I was established
Momma told me stop trapping and capping
Boy you talented
I did not listen so I ended up with the savages
Stuck in the county couldn't do nothing it was tragedy
I just wanna look like I'm the president
In the trap everyday man I had perfect attendance
All of the re up money I fucked up and I spent it
When I told my momma that we gon' be rich, nigga I meant it
I just wanna live like I'm a bachelor
Got the chef in the kitchen cooking up caviar
Doing hundred in the rari screaming fuck the law
Got the chopper aiming at you with the monkey balls
If I don't got the actavis then it's withdrawl
Got the pussy nigga missing like a sick call
I just wanna be on top and never ever fall
Up and downs in the trap like a see-saw
Trap, trapping out the gym without a basketball
I just want millions of dollars and partners that shoot you like shottas
I got two bitches they fucking and swallow
Don't love them just swap them
I just wanna be what I wanna be
Got two lambo seats in the old school topless T
Cruising like Penelope
I grew up on the westside of avenue
You can ask everyone about me
Game in a knot like a tennis shoe
What you gonna do when the feds run into you
I came from trying on clothes in the fitting room
To locking the doors in the Bentley coupe
If my bro drop the pack, then you know I got it
The coupe got the gadgets its like robotics
Giuseppe Zanotti it mark my body
Young rich nigga still walking round with the profit
Tell you a story about one little bird
One little bird when the pecking on the curb
Did he get up, did he fly like a real bird
Over the sea with the white like young Spielberg
30 pointer, 40 pointer
Look at the Franck Muller
Walk in your city
I feel like a king
I am the ruler
(pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Who is the shooter
My niggas be trap off the calculator like computer
(gone)
