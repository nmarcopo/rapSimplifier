*Lyrics from Snippets*
...always right
And love your mother, she's the reason why we're both alive
That's right, my little butterfly, butterfly, you got a long way to go
Darling, just take it slow
...wonder if there's only a frame
It's what's inside, that heart following love in those veins
I still see Johnny...
My little brotha, we evolve, we evolve like
Butterfly, butterfly, you got a long way to go
Darling, just take it slow
