Uhh, uhh, yes sir!
Just the sound of his voice is a hit, heh heh
Y'all niggas got me really confused out there
I make Big Pimpin' or Give it 2 Me one of those
They hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
I make some thought provokin' shit
Y'all question whether he fallin' off
I'ma really confuse y'all on this one... follow!
When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
"That's him!", I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he wit', or his chip amount
'Cause I been doin' this since CHiPs was out
Watchin' Erik Estrada
Baggin' up at the Ramada, table full of powder
A/C broke, 'bout to take another shower on my 25th Hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game or the flight
You might see me anywhere, a day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night
I'm so bossy, bitch get off me
Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6's on Sprees
Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me
This is that ignorant shit you like
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus ice, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you love
Nigga fuck shit maricón puta and drugs, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you need
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus weed, c'mon
I'm only tryin' to give you what you want
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like it don't front!
They're all actors, lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
Can't even face themselves, don't fear no rappers
They're all weirdos, De Niros in practice
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures
It's mostly backwards, unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song you happen to see
Then, actually, believe half of what you see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
And with that said, I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell
Shoot niggas straight through the ER, whoa!
This ain't B.R., no, it's S.C. CEO
The next Lyor, no, the next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel, go...
I got that ignorant shit you like, nigga
I don't give a fuck, plus ass and ice, nigga
I got that gangsta shit you love
Nigga, bang out, brains out, money and drugs
I got that ignorant shit you need, nigga
Hydro, Blueberry, bomb ass weed, nigga
I got that project shit you want
Nigga, dope fiends OD, you love it don't front!
I'm so bossy, bitch get off me
Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6's on Sprees
Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me
Excuse me bitch, fuck your name
Can you come, can you gimme some brain?
When you're done, can you please get the fuck out of my sight?
I built an ark, mami, cry me a river
Blacken my heart by puttin' light liquor in the liver
Put my all in the part that spreads apart now I'm back together
Young Goldie, The Mack forever
Heard they love it when I'm hard on hoes
Said a G don't give a bitch no keys or security codes
I agree, my lady ain't no bitch, she gets whatever I own
So when you see her, understand that's me, nigga
Understand I'm the same OG, nigga
I know the difference 'tween a bitch and a B, nigga
...trick get off me, you can't get shit off me
This is that ignorant shit you like
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus ice, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you love
Nigga fuck shit maricón puta and drugs, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you need
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus weed, c'mon
I'm only tryin' to give you what you want
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like it don't front!
I'm so bossy, bitch get off me
Trick get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no 6's on Sprees
Laid back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me
