(Hook)
I'm the greatest mc, I'm the greatest mc in the worrllld

(Verse 1)
As soon as I grab it
I eat it up like a, savage
And no I don't have it

I'm on my p's and q's and carrots
Yall don't understand? Well god damn don't yall know my status?
I'm flowin the fattest(mmmm), that is (mmm), I'm the baddest
No need to explain my name, the only thing that matters
For suckas who bite me
They find I'm a bit much to swallow
You thinkin it's hollow
My rhythm is too r-rugged to follow
It hit you like bam, biggeda bam bam, biggeda bam... aiight?
God damn...
The kid is a wizard, I'm definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with g rap on the road to riches
As soon as I step up, nahhh, whenever I'm in the, ugh, whatever I touch whatever I clutch you know I'm gonna injure
Ugh, the nigga don't play
Ugh, the nigga'll slay
So wiggle away heyyy you gotta dig that nigga jayyyyy...
