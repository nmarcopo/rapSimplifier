I know you know I'm in too deep to let it go
I know you know it's in my nature to get distant
I know it's been a year since I left you alone
Unfortunate, I think you know there's something missing
(But you never say shit)
But you never say shit
(Don't know how to take it)
Don't know how to take it (Take it, yeah)
We're good on our own
But I miss being home wit'cha at your place and
I drink you under tables (I drink you under tables)
Got you misbehaving (Got you misbehaving)
Buzzing your body
Body to body
You said you're over me
Now you're all over me
Buzzing your body
Body to body
You said you're over me
Now you're all over me
You block me then you hit me up
Like, "Pick me up"
I hit you back like, "Send me something
Show me something"
I ain't seen you in a year or something
So what's up
You already how i’m coming
I’m buzzin your body up
Gotta call you first like shotty
Bussin' your -- bussin' your body up
Buzzing your body
Body to body
You said you're over me
Now you're all over me
Buzzing your body
Body to body
You said you're over me
Now you're all over me
