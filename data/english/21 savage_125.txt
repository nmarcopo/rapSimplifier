Lyrics from Snippet
Maybach V12, big dawg status
Get your ass whacked, I got a homicide fetish
Come pick up your bitch, I put my hot dog in her relish
Your baby mama test me, she want hot dog in her belly
How these niggas still gang-gang and they tellin'?
All my shooters workin' at Eliantte, but they killin'
She'll point a finger, but in private, she be stealin'
Thirty models in the house, I gave 'em each a minute
Yeah, you know, it's thirty models in the house, really
They say, "Use your time wisely," so I gave each of 'em a minute
Know what I'm sayin'? They enjoyed it too
You know it's enough of me to go around, don't be stingy
I'm in a Rover with a shooter
Got a college girl and a cougar
I got thirty hollows in this Ruger
And my Glock give lessons, it's a tutor
I ain't with the jibber jab, give your ass the quickest jab
I'm the type to buy a Bentley, you the type to skip a tab
