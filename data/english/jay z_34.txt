London bridges are falling down
Not bridges but britches when Jigga’s in town
Lady, show me your knickers
I might let you kick it if you don’t tell the missus
Quick, run, before the tabloids come
Run from the night or we end up in The Sun
I’m just taking the piss — unless you’re gonna do it
Oh Nelly’s gone so Makaveli
Bring two packs of condoms when you come to the tele
Tell me if this is true
If diamond’s are a girls’ best friend, my crew
Would like to extend an invitation to you
We like to invite you to
Our family –
Jewelry I mean ‘cause my jewels currently is being guarded by the queen
