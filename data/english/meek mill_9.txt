I'm already convicted
My whole life has been turned around
I lost every job, I lost everything, every opportunity I can get
Can't get, buy cars, can't get rent, can't get none of that
But I'm still a survivor, y'know, I'm still coming to court
Still smiling, still signing autographs, but soon I'ma go crazy!
You know what I'm sayin? And it's up to the world, y'know
America eats its babies, we, I'm
No matter what y'all think about me
I'm still your child, you know what I'm sayin?
You can't just turn me off like that
Huh! Huh! Huh!

2Pac back, 2Pac back
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better picture me rollin’
Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
Ugh! 2Pac back, I’m two Glocks strapped
Rolling down in Philly, this the new Iraq (Philly!)
Soon as I hit the the hood, they screaming, "Who got whacked?"
It’s a recession on the work, I’m screaming, "Who got crack?"
I’m sipping Hennessy!
Riding on my muh'fucking enemies!
Sliding in the back, I'm screaming, "MMG!" (Maybach Music)
10 bitches and they dime so it’s Tennessee
Hail Mary, put my wrist on froze, presidential is gold
A nigga play with my money, my shooters lifting his soul
Bloh! That kick like it's soccer, bullets hitting the goal
Bitch, I’m like John Wall, 'cause I just give 'em and go
Plotting on this new 7, I can picture me rolling
Pockets look like they pregnant because them bitches is swollen
Got a clip I can loan, all them snitches could hold 'em
Look at them motherfucking wheels! Them bitches is stolen
They screamin'
2Pac back, 2Pac back
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better picture me rollin’
Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming, "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
Mommy a soldier, daddy is dead
We catch the nigga that did it then we gon’ carry his head
Fuck a 911, tell 'em have him a bed
Talking Death Row records, tell em have me a chair
Let it burn, I’m screaming: "Free my nigga Hearn!"
He’s due in, no hestitation, we can’t even get a turn
Got my Makaveli CD then I listened than I learned
Grabbed my Mac above the dresser, my OG said, "Hold it firm"
I’m dreaming spitting with Pac (Pac!) and cyphers with B.I.G (B.I.G!)
Tried to send me upstate with the license and bid
Had me scraping my wax, sleeping, my knife in the bed
They got a nigga on point like it's a price on my head
I'm going max! Got me knocking suckers and they back
In these cells, raising hell, tryna get back to the trap
But don’t never get it twisted, it’s Meek Mill, we spittin’ facts (Meek Milly!)
Plus somebody said they seen it and they mean it
So they steady screamin'
2Pac back, 2Pac back
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better picture me rollin’
Buying brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
