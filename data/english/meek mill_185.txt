Yeah, I gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed
So tell me, how does it feel
To lose the one you believe in
I make you drop it on a Tuesday
I had the park on, poppin', we made a movie
So many feelings involved, the way you do me
Tell me you're ready and I'll just [?] the [?]
Got one shot to do what it takes
Got no time for no mistakes
I see the light 'cause I'm hazy
They tried to hold me, but I didn't
Every time you text me
And by the time I'm replyin'
It's too late
Now I feel a way, way, yeah
Oh, and I gave you more
Yeah, I gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed
So tell me, how does it feel
To lose the one you believe in
Yeah, I confess, I wasn't ready but I was pressed
I was caught up in the lights from all the jets
All the pretty hoes, the X and Os, the diamonds, VVS
They was shinin', I was blinded, you was dope as CVS
What the fuck I was thinkin'?
The fuck I was drinkin'?
Runnin' 'round with these bitches
Our relationship sinkin' (Ooh)
Half a mill on her finger
Spent a Abraham Lincoln
Caught you textin' that nigga
I guess you gotta get even, damn
It was gettin' scarier
Your love was so superior
Never thought that I would see them times and I'd be tearin' up
Thinkin' 'bout the times of what we was and what we have now
We build again and I won't tear back down, I promise
Yeah, I gave you more than you wanted (Wanted, yeah)
I gave you more than you needed (Needed)
So tell me, how does it feel (How's it feel, baby?)
To lose the one you believe in
Yeah, see that's the thing about trust
It's never been about us
'Cause we were doin' too much
We threw the rocks out apartments
Gave you the key where my heart be
You didn't say it, but you get it
You shouldn't hurt, but me but I let it
Every time I'm alone now
I feel like things are not the same
No, I feel a way, oh-oh
Every time you text me
And by the time I reply
It's too late
Something's gettin' in the way
Yeah, I gave you more than you wanted
I gave you more than you needed (Oh right)
So tell me, how does it feel
To lose the one you were leaving?
