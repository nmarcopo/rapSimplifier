*Lyrics from Snippets*
...the offer you gave me was preposterous
Papi, this bird won't fly, you sold me an ostrich
I'm just another nigga tryna keep his money up
I'll wipe that smirk off your face, you think it's funny, huh?
I ain't playin' my nigga, go ahead and giggle
But bullets don't tickle
If you think you playin' with Elmo, hell no
