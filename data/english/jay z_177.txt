I can't get with that
I gotta keep it thick, never miss, so I hit 'em like this
Straight to the track my lyrics is phat I rip it the fuck down
More than a fluke I'm regularly wreckin this shit so what now
So many brothers be bitin' they tongue to detect who I be
Well check out the J check out the A check out the Y.... Z
Original rap I'm makin it slap I'm hemmin it up like that
Stringin it, slangin it, swingin it fat, bring it back
I be that nigga with a gat boom-clack
Don't ever sweat it when I go, I zoom back
Better than ever, never better, you better, whatever
I suggest some Ex-Lax and that'll get your shit together
I give you a snotty nose from body blows
Nobody's safe at a party even Gotti goes adios
I got-got-got Flav-flav-flav-flavor so save yours
One verse and it's a hearse I played and I slayed yours
Get it, got it, ready to flip, I doubt it
No need to prolong, Jigga the man, gone!
I'm out
The next nigga never get no rest you're livin' with stress
Cause just around the corner be the best nigga
You're fearin my clout if weed got you runnin' your mouth
You better blow that shit out
The Jigga's back you niggas are flat
I'll amaze the way that Jay rap now how in the hell did he say that?
You diggin' me the epitome of rippin' it raw
You kiddin' me no nigga that rap gettin' bigger than me
Although ya niggas are wettin' my style I'm still thristy
And we all gotta fall off but you first G
I'll be the last it'll be a cold day in hell
Before you see me Sauce and Jaz chillin with your wack ass
We break shit and harmony like Take 6
While you niggas double pumped off the fake shit
Our Roc-A-Fella never sell-a-out
Brothers who don't have the heart you better tell your mouth nigga
Listen
I don't kick it I punt it I'm so wicked you want it?
My tongue's just tired from lickin' my fingers and countin' up hundreds
So I bought a money machine and it goes
A tat-tit-trrrrrrr-at-tit-trrrrrt-at-tit-tit-Git-Dough
How many styles I gotta kick to prove I'm def?
I can even-kick my--rip that-shit-and catch a breath
I'm nicer than a bitch, ask this nigga Dash
Now he don't count cause I'm makin his ass rich
This nigga's nothin but the truth
Many view Jay-Z as a threat to they loot.. fuck 'em
My shit is tight, can't slip, gotta grip
Like a pit in a dog fight my shit is aight
I ain't checkin' for you 'less you my peoples
And just in case you didn't know peep the steelo
It goes one dime for your mind
And two bone crushers for your spine
Cause none of ya game is rougher than mine
