DJ Heat, what up?
Hello, hit every lying clip with a Eggo
I pop more than I pop for when the cop blow
You Fruity Pebble, homosexual wearing velcro
Who gassed you up? Man, I raised the price of the petro
Killing Cali, gang bangers and GTA's
Weed and water, come and swim on a tidal wave
I'm fucked up, psychologically braindead
I once walked into a Blood group, wearing all red
Wonder why nobody's banging on me
Getting mad as fuck, then the police came
Mistaking me for a real thug, this is not a game
I'm from Compton too, shoutout to Game, give me a pair of shoes
Finna skydive off the peak of my career
Though it's not here yet, you motherfuckers still know who's best
From the murder cap, you never heard of that, okay
What about now? Clip-clip, pow, man down
It's like this and like that and like this and a
It's like that and like this and like that and a
Killer Cali niggas don't know how to act and I
Never know so ride around strapped and I
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Washed up, bang, bang, you know what's good, bang, bang
Who said Long Beach don't keep it hood?
Five minutes away, say you can die today if you dumbing out
Well let's just say, if you run your trout
You fucking fish get shot in the mouth
And plus your bitch get shot in the mouth
That's ejaculation, you kiss it, then you taste it
I road around with my antennas up like
Television way before the satellite
K Dot mechanisms, learn something
I could tell that you don't know nothing
By the way you carry yourself
You dumb fuck, I'm basked up and Jim Carrey myself
You better duck, bless screwed, you'll be eating through a tube
I've been fueled, that's the fucking guy
I've been fueled, that's too fucking fly
So where's my parachute, I'm 'bout to jump from the Hoover Dam
No car cue, I think I landed in the Hoover, damn
They 'bout to shoot
It's like this and like that and like this and a
It's like that and like this and like that and a
Killer Cali niggas don't know how to act and I
Never know so ride around strapped and I
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Washed up, bang, bang, you know what's good, bang, bang
I'm an East side savage, black matters bring tragics
Spray maggots, swat flies for the practice
It's a habit, laughing at you bitch ass niggas, get on my level
Heavy metal when I'm rocking in my jeans
Got a problem then I'm hopping at your team
Drop your captor for acting like he wanted the drama
Grab the llama, she baddest mama
House disrespectful, blame it on the hood I come from
Niggas cicadas, with their little babies walking with guns
Catch me walking with some
I'm double hot, I'm walking with heat that's under the sun
You blood pop, you done if you ain't got one
Better step your game up before it's over
Before you know it, you're close to showing
Sulken red, fall on the ground, you know he dead
Down for the count like an accountant
California, what you know about it?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Like Master Pete, I am the streets
Jay Rock
It's like this and like that and like this and a
It's like that and like this and like that and a
Killer Cali niggas don't know how to act and I
Never know so ride around strapped and I
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Compton, bang, bang, Inglewood, bang, bang
Washed up, bang, bang, you know what's good, bang, bang
