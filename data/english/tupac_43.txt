They wanna bury me I'm worried
I'm losin' my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine
And my vision's blurry
Fallin' to pieces, am I guilty?
I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me unfortunately 'cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless
I'm chokin' off Marijuana smoke
With every toke it's like I'm losin' focus
Fallin' to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin', and goin' nutty
And reminiscin' bout them niggas that murdered my buddy
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin' funny
Flashbacks of bustin caps, anything for money
Where am I goin' I discovered can't nothin' save me
My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
Everybody's dyin' am I next, who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin', two to the head
While I'm in bed, leakin' blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller?
Gettin' suspicious of this bitch the line's busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin' all her homies
That I can fuck her like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure gettin' drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennessy, I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
They wanna bury me, I'm worried, no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm losin' homies, ain't that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?
Then tell me am I lost 'cause I'm lonely?
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin'
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound
Well Hell can't be worse than this, 'cause I'm in Hell now
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
Ayo are you afraid to die?
Or Do you wanna live forever?
Tell me which one?
Hahahaha
I ain't scared to die
I ain't scared to die
