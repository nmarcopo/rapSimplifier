I'm hard, Jehovah said I'm barred from the pearly gates
Fuck Him, I didn't wanna go to heaven anyway
But my momma got me on my knees with my hands gripped
Talkin' bout some "praise the Lord" shit
Hail Mary, fuck her, I never knew her
I'd probably screw her and dump her body in the sewer
Our father, my pops stuck up dope spots
Big, black, and mean, with the fifth by the Gabardine
What you expected from his next of kin, huh?
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin'
The lesson from the Smith & Wesson is depressin'
Niggas keep stressin', the same motherfuckin' question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake, Ron G, stop the break
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
Follow me, tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin' to kill me
Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points till they drill me
Keepin' it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin' steel
See niggas is false, sittin' in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they're petrified bitches
I'm tryin' to be strong, they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world till I'm gone
Bitches be warned - word is bond, you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Giuliani, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do'
With fo'-fo's, hahaha
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
I be that young, pretty fly, smooth, glorious kid
A Bad Boy, just like Notorious B.I.G
I'll Roc-a-Fella like Shawn Carter
With more game than Ron Harper
The bomb sparker rapper slash charm robber
While y'all be on the corners bummy and high
I be out buyin' the finest shit money can buy
You wish you was in a position that I'm in
Hot rhymin', diamonds shinin', autograph signin'
My lifestyle is far out
Every week, bring a different car out
I go to nightclubs and buy the bar out
Uh, 'cause I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
Every time I touch mics, you hear all the freaks scream
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
You know the flave, you know I love to misbehave
With Ron G blessin' me with the hype, nigga
Yeah, nigga
Thug Life the waterbed, deadly combination boy
Ron J ain't no motherfucking joke
It's the heat nigga
Now rewind this motherfucker, you know you can't help it
