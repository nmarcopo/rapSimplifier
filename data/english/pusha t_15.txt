Real ballers, they love it
Rollie faces, they flood it
This diamond life is like dynamite
Explosive and it's cold blooded
My handles can't be trusted
Cross you up so disgusting
No splash brothers, I slash brothers
Shower Posse like Dudus
See I got a thousand cousins
I was focused when y'all wasn't
You played the sport, I played the porch
I served it straight out my oven
While y'all was out there clubbin'
I ran suicides in the dungeon
No plain kicks in my Dame 6
I showed them all who they wasn't
Money on my mind
That's the scoreboard
(Money on my mind
That's the scoreboard)
Money on my mind
That's the scoreboard
(Money on my mind
That's the scoreboard)
CHING!
The closer
Shake your head off your shoulders
And ankle break his opponents
Cross you up, hocus pocus
This Oakland kid is a soldier
They said it's no one that's colder
They say is heart is like polar
'Cause he will hit the game winner
Bye, bye, it was nice to know ya
Adidas (Watch this, watch this, yeah)
Dame 6 (I've been ballin', yeah)
King Push
Watch this, watch this, yeah
I've been ballin', yeah
Watch this, watch this, yeah
I've been ballin', yeah
Watch this, watch this, yeah
