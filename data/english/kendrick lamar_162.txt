*So what up Jay?*
Shit nothing but the money
*What you trying to say?*
More fifties more hundreds
*Who you trying to be?*
Who I already is
King of my city, that's no pop quiz
Sitting in my Chevy smoking heavy on the best bud
Get it from the source
Got the best plug
Watts California be my city till the death bruh
You ain't hearing that?
Then you deaf blood
Moving like a snail
You can catch a slug
Hit you like a snare
I got big drums
Hunt for every dollar
I just stack funds
Yours is insufficient
That's why you mad huh?
Ever since I got a deal niggas hate me hard
So I keep a steel
Got no time to spar
Got no time to spare, money on my mind
Like hair
Like a flight of steps
All a nigga get is stairs
Big bag of green
Looking like a pear
When I hit a club
I'm leaving with a pair
Nigga I don't care
Bitch I'm a baller
Crash my whip today and cop another one tomorrow

Who I already is
King of my city, gotta get it how I live
Me without a dollar is like a scholar with no smarts (whats that?)
That don't make sense don't it? (mm-mmh)
I'm in a Lamborghini with a Brazilian woman (oh yeah?)
Miss Novocaine
Suck my dick till she numb it (god damn)
You fly like a plane
But I'm more like a comet
Soaring over the atmosphere
I can hear the aliens cheer (ha)
Victory is sweet my dear (mm-hmm)
Here's the technique my dear (mm-hmm)
And maybe you can duplicate me
It's weird how y'all never can progress within the process
Of making residuals
I guess that you ain't I yet
Try to interfere with the dinero that I get
Watch y'all bear arms like women rub on my triceps duddy
Y'all is funny to me
You thought I came by myself nope
It's money with me
It's the root of all evil, but the need of all people
Yours is frail
I weigh mines on Brannon Scales
