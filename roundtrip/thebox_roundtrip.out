Pull out the coupe in the parking lot
Told them "Fuck 12, fuck SWAT"
Bustin 'all the bales out of the box
I just licked the box
Had to put the stick in a box, mm
Pour the whole damn seal on, I'm getting lazy
I got the Mojo deals, we were like in the 80s
She sucked a nigga soul and got the cash app
I told them they wipe a nigga nose, let's say latte, latte
I will never sell my soul and I can support that
And I really want to know where you are, where?
I was out there again where the hiding place was
Drive through the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (skrrt).
Because I know these niggas after where the bag is
I have to move smarter, I have to move harder
Niggas Tryna gets me for my water
I put his ass on my son or daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
'Lotta Niggas playing out here is not a ballin'
I put my whole arm in the edge, Vince Carter
And I know I'll probably get a key for the quarter
Hardly seen Shawty in double Cs, I bought them
I have a slut who looks like Aaliyah, she is a model
I got the pink panties, all my whips are without keys
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek likes the sea, forget it
Pull out the coupe in the parking lot
Told them "Fuck 12, fuck SWAT"

Ha-ha-ha, I brought her out
When Steelo is with me, he has the blues in his pocket
Bring her into the forest, put the wood in her mouth
The bitch doesn't wear shoes in my house
The private home that I fly into, I never want to fly again
I take my risk in traffic
She doesn't suck hands on cock with it
I just made the Rollie like a runway
I am a presidential candidate for 2020
I put hunnid bands on Zimmerman shit
I moved real gangsta, so she chose a crip
Shawty calls me Crisco because I bang my shit
Got it out of the mud, you can't tell me anything, yes
When I got the drugs, I was rich on the street, yes
Pull out the coupe in the parking lot
Told them "Fuck 12, fuck SWAT"
Bustin 'all the bales out of the box
